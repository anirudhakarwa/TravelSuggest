The Coronado offers a full season of Broadway shows, concerts and other performances.  The MetroCentre, Rockfords downtown 10,000-seat arena, is home to music, athletic and exposition events.  In the summer months, Starlight Theatre on the campus of Rock Valley College features classical and contemporary musical productions.  The theatre has a unique mechanical roof that opens out like a blooming flower on clear nights.  Rockford also has a symphony orchestra, dance company and several theatre companies.</field>
