		<field name="content">Houstons climate generally ranges from a hot humid summer to a mild winter. The months of October to April make for fantastic times to visit to avoid the heat.  Visitors from areas with mild summers or dry climates should be extremely careful if planning to travel there in the summer months, especially around August.  The combination of high heat and thick humidity can result in stifling and oppressive weather.  Its by no means "a dry heat"!  Even some lifelong residents of Houston complain about the August weather. If visiting in the summer, stay hydrated and try to limit outdoor exposure during the hours between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM.  The nights are very hot too, but not as dangerously hot as during the day. Visitors from cooler, drier places will be amazed at the tolerance levels of some of the locals.  You can see people wearing long sleeve shirts, boots and jeans when the temperature is above 100 Â°F and humidity is in the 90% range.  But it can not be stressed enough: this place is extremely hot and if youre not prepared or used to this type of heat, youre in for one rude awakening.  But have fun!</field>
