		<field name="content">Although Anchorage itself is accessible via most major domestic carriers and some international carriers,  Alaska Airlines  has a virtual monopoly on jet air travel within the state, meaning prices are extremely high. The airline offers frequent jet service (sometimes in unique Boeing 737-400 "combi" aircraft, where the front half of the aircraft is configured as a cargo hold and the rear half is configured for passenger use) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. Smaller communities are served by the three main regional jet and turboprop commuter airlines:  ERA Aviation ,  PenAir , and  Frontier Flying Service . The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered Bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the Piper Navajo, or the smaller Cessna 207, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the seaplane. The worlds busiest seaplane base is  Lake Hood , located next to Ted Stevens airport in Anchorage, where flights bound for remote areas carry passengers, cargo, and lots of items from Costco and Sams Club.  Small planes are a great way to get around Alaska if you are fortunate enough to be able to afford doing it. After you have touched down from your main flight to Alaska, you can board small planes that can transport you fast and efficiently. Many places arent accessible by car or truck; so small planes are commonly used to get to destinations quickly. If you are going on a hunting trip, chances are that you will need to board one of these planes to get there. Hunting areas in Alaska are sometimes commercialized for tourists. The areas that they bring you to are commonly hunted by other tourists. This continued use has made it a lot easier for pilots to land. A pilot can land on flat ground that is continuously used for landing small planes onto.</field>

		<field name="content">The  Alaska Railroad  runs from  Seward  through  Anchorage ,  Denali , and Fairbanks to North Pole, with spurs to Whittier and Palmer. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving Alaskas natural resources—primarily coal—to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward as well as fuel and gravel for use in Anchorage. The Alaska Railroad is the only remaining railroad in North America to use cabooses on its freight trains. The route between  Talkeetna  and Hurricane (between Talkeetna and Denali) features the last remaining flag stop train service in North America. A stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area. Residents board the train in Talkeetna and tell the conductor where they want to get off. When they want to come to town, they wait by the side of the tracks and "flag" the train, giving it its name.</field>

		<field name="content">Alaska is arguably the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The states road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital,  Juneau , is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, which links the Seward Highway south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of Whittier. The tunnel is the longest road tunnel in North America at nearly 2.5 miles and combines a one-lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing. Consequently, eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the Alaska Railroad must share the tunnel, resulting in waits up to 45 minutes (or more) to enter; for specific times, see the  schedule .  Anchorage and Fairbanks are served by all of the major national rental car chains as well as a number of independents. Some smaller towns around the state may also have a national chain company presence.  Be advised that renting a car in Alaska can be more expensive than pretty much anywhere else in the United States, ranging up to (and occasionally even over) $200 per day for a large vehicle sufficient to carry multiple passengers and outdoor gear during the peak season. In the dead of winter, however, you can sometimes grab a vehicle for under $10 per day.  Be aware that renting at the Anchorage or Fairbanks airport incurs a 10-12% additional airport surcharge (plus an additional $4.81 per day in Anchorage). If youre renting for more than a few days, it might be worth the hassle to rent your vehicle at an off-airport location, which usually involves taxi rides or shuffling between hotel and rental car courtesy shuttles. Check with each agency or search off-airport rental cars using an online travel agency to see what cost savings may be available.</field>

		<field name="content">There are several bus and shuttle services that can take you between cities on the road system. You will see many tour buses from major tour lines, although their tickets are usually only sold in a package tour. There are other companies that do sell individual tickets. The  Alaska Park Connection  sells tickets between  Seward ,  Anchorage ,  Talkeetna , and  Denali .  Denali Motorcoach  operates daily schedule between  Anchorage , and  Denali .  Alaska Direct Bus Line  travels from  Whittier  to  Anchorage , north to Tok and  Fairbanks , and also to  Whitehorse .  Alaska Bus Gus  provides scheduled service between Anchorage-Denali National Park and Fairbanks, (including flag stops) along the Scenic George Parks Highway. Drivers provide historic and geological information and frequent wildlife/scenic photo stops.  Pricing is very competitive.  Group tours, airport and Alaska Railroad shuttle service is available.  Alaska/Yukon Trails  has lines from Anchorage to Denali to Fairbanks, and they also have routes from  Dawson City ,  Whitehorse , and other smaller towns.  Homer Stage Line  has busses from Anchorage south to the  Kenai Peninsula , stopping in cities like Cooper Landing,  Homer ,  Kenai ,  Seward , and  Soldotna .

		<field name="content">While sidewalks and bike paths are present in the main cities, bicycling along the major highways is a dangerous proposition.  Areas near the main cities occasionally offer bike paths and wide shoulders, but many areas of Alaskas main highways are not advisable for bicycling.  The Seward and portions of the Glenn Highways, in particular, have very narrow shoulders and are flanked by cliffs on one or both sides, leaving very little or no room for pedestrians and bicyclists to travel safely.</field>

		<field name="name">by boat</field>
		<field name="content">One of the best ways to see Alaska is by cruise ship.  Cruise ships  bring you wonderfully close to glaciers, whales and rocky coasts.  Larger boats offering more amenities, while small ships and yachts carrying 12-100 passengers go where the big ships cant, getting you up close to Alaskas nature and wildlife.  Many vessels include naturalist guided hikes and sea kayaking right from the ship, perfect for active, casual travelers.  Cruise ships have 2 main itineraries: The Inside Passage Route going roundtrip from either Seattle, Washington or Vancouver, Canada and the Gulf Route running Northbound and Southbound cruises between Vancouver and Seward/Whittier.  Companies offering cruises in Alaska include:   Holland America .  The Glacier Discovery Cruise offered by Holland America Line, runs between Seward and Vancouver, BC.  Princess Cruises , offers both Inside Passage and Glacier Bay routes as well as roundtrips from San Francisco.  Adventure Life , offer small-ship cruising exclusively, working with vessels in Alaska ranging from 32 to 138 passengers.  Norwegian Cruise Line , offers only roundtrips in Seattle and Vancouver.  Carnival Cruises , has only one ship deployed in Alaska annually doing mainly Northbound and Southbound cruises.  AdventureSmith Explorations  specializes in small ship and yacht cruising in Alaska with over 25 years experience that.  Regent Seven Seas Cruises , luxury cruise line with all inclusive cruises to Alaska.  Cruise 118 , Cruise 118 Holiday Cruises from Southampton to the Mediterranean, Alaska and the Caribbean.  Disney Cruise Lines  Inside passage trip to Tracy Arm, Ketchikan, Skagway, and Juneau leaving from Vancouver~This is a great way to see the glaciers in Tracy Arm, as it is smaller than Princess or Carnival, so it can get closer, farther, and do a 360° turn  Ferry   Alaska Marine Highway System , +1 800 526-6731. Alaskas Marine Highway consists of over 8000 miles of coastal ocean routes connecting 31 port communities throughout Southeast, Southcentral and Southwest Alaska. Two additional ports are located outside of Alaska - one in British Columbia and the other in the state of Washington. It forms an essential method of transportation for many local residents in towns to which there is no road access. The Marine Highway system also allows walk-on travelers, bicycles and commercial vehicles. You can arrange your own cabin on the ferry, pitch a tent, or roll out a sleeping bag on the upper decks. Naturalists sometimes on board to give commentary on sights and wildlife.  Of course, after you get off the boat, youll want to stay and explore Alaskas inland destinations. Dont get straight on an airplane and head home—youll miss out on some of the best Alaska has to offer!   Also try a fishing charter at any of alaskas fine coastal communities and send your catch home to your family or friends.</field>

This may at times leave you open to getting ripped off by the driver.  Its best to call the company and ask for the fare prior to getting into the cab.</field>

CDTA fares are $1.50 each way or $4 per day, no matter the distance traveled, and can be paid in $1.50 notes, coins or with prepaid cards of various denominations. CDTA tends to operate between 6:00AM and 12:00AM Monday through Friday. Saturday bus service is much more limited, depending on which route is taken,(some routes do not run on Saturday). Sunday bus service in Albany is extremely limited is a few routes that run in the city, and between Albany and Schenectady Albany and Troy. Most places are on bus lines that run about every 20 minutes or less during the day on weekdays and every 30 minutes at night, while on weekends buses run about every 20 minutes or more. It is highly advisable to go the CDTA web site, and/or get a bus schedule before trying to get a bus that does not run where you want go or when you want to catch it.</field>

		<field name="content">If youre driving, be prepared for frequent road construction.  The city government web site gives  information on major construction projects , but there are always minor ones going on. Several radio stations try to give traffic reports during morning and afternoon rush hours, but the service tends to come and go, and its best to inquire locally as to which stations are currently offering it.  KKOB-AM, 770 on the dial, seems to be fairly reliable for these reports. The interchange of I-40 and I-25 is commonly called "The Big I", and you will hear it referred to as such in traffic reports. Traffic congestion, while not nearly as horrible as some of the other cities in the Western U.S., can still get bad during the rush hour and on Saturdays. The two interstates and the river crossings usually have the worst congestion.  Many Albuquerqueans seem to consider I-40 and 25, which run through the city, to be their own personal expressways. The lack of turn signal usage is a running joke for most Albuquerque drivers, so watch for cars changing lanes without warning. However, Interstate traffic usually flows around the pace of the speed limit.  Keep in mind that driving while talking on your cell phone is illegal in Albuquerque unless you use a hands-free system.</field>

		<field name="content">ABQ RIDE , +1 505 243-RIDE, is Albuquerques public transit system although its a driving city, and until very recently the city was not trying to make any great strides in its public transit system. So with the exception of Central Ave., public transit here is still for the most part very underdeveloped. Most of ABQ Rides routes spur out of the Alvarado Transportation Center (in downtown at Central Ave. First St.), which also serves as Albuquerques Amtrak station and Greyhound depot. Bus service is reduced during the weekend.  The Rapid Ride is an express bus service operated by ABQ Ride which runs frequently, utilizing bright red articulated buses. There are three Rapid Ride routes: the Route 766 (Red Line) and Route 777 (Green Line) each run very frequently and almost entirely on Central Ave., with the 766 running from Uptown to Unser/Central, while the 777 runs from Tramway/Central to Downtown. The Route 790 (Blue Line) connects UNM to the Cottonwood Mall area on the Westside, running less frequently than the Red and Green Lines.  Standard fares for all ABQ Ride routes are $1 per ride, with several discounts possible. A day pass is $2.  A day pass is included in the price of a Rail Runner Express day pass, so visitors who ride the train to Albuquerque can also ride the bus for free using their train ticket.</field>

		<field name="content">Albuquerque is fairly bikeable, but its a sprawling Western city and things are spread out. Its hillier than it looks; Old Town and downtown attractions are several hundred feet lower than things in the heights on the eastern side of the city; plan accordingly. Getting around by bike can be a mixed bag in Albuquerque: street cycling can be risky at times; drivers may not always be aware and most major streets lack bicycle lanes (and even those that do have lanes may require uncomfortably close proximity to fast traffic). On the other hand, Albuquerque has a very proactive cycling community and a splendid paved trail network which is undergoing an expansion phase.  The crown jewel in this network is the Paseo del Bosque Trail, which runs along the east side of the Rio Grande and offers lovely riverside scenery.  Another backbone to the trail network is the North Diversion Channel Trail which runs from UNM north to Balloon Fiesta Park, and while not nearly as scenic as the Bosque trail (it runs along a concrete drainage channel and past some industry) it offers the occasional grand vista of the city. Another fun ride is the paved trail along Tramway Boulevard on the eastern edge of the city, which offers excellent views of the city and access to the foothills of the Sandia Mountains. You can find a complete bike map of all the trails, lanes, and recommended routes on  the citys bicycling website .</field>

		<field name="content">Most visitors to  Lehigh Valley  will want to either rent a car or drive their own.    Due to the fact that 7th street in Allentown is one-way, if you aim to go north to Whitehall, you will want to be on 6th street. Be forewarned, Route 145 turns off 6th Street at Greenleaf Street for one block, and then joins 7th Street (begins as two ways). Continuing on 6th will bring you to the same place, but will not carry the PA-145 designation.  Hamilton Street is a continuation of US 222/ Hamilton Boulevard and provides easy access for travelers from Reading Lancaster. Hamilton Street continues into nearby  Bethlehem  as Hanover Avenue, providing direct access to its downtown as well.  Tilghman Street is also a useful east-west urban thoroughfare that also provides access to  Bethlehem , as Union Boulevard, and  Easton  as well.  US Route 22 is a 4 lane limited-access freeway across the north side of the city, and is often the best route of approach.  However, this road is prone to minor traffic jams and accidents, especially during rush hour.  Dont panic, though; most traffic jams are only a mile or so long, and usually take less than half an hour before opening up into freer travel.  Interstate 78 is a better bet during rush hours as it is as wide as eight lanes in some areas.</field>

Though there are no bike lanes and traffic can be heavy at times, biking the scenic drive is a great way to see the park. The Salt Valley and Willow Springs roads are less traveled but are more suited to mountain bikes due to washboards, deep sand and other obstacles.  Bicycles are only permitted on roads: there is no single track or trail riding in the park. When biking on the main road, please use caution and ride single file on the edge of the lane.</field>

		<field name="content">Nearly all major attractions and tourist destinations in Arizona are accessible via car.   Interstate 17 (I-17) runs south to north across central Arizona and connects travelers with the major cities of  Phoenix  and  Flagstaff .  I-17 is the main route north to Sedona, Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon from Phoenix.  It provides easy access to  Sedona  via AZ 179 as well as  Prescott ,  Jerome  and Montezuma Castle National Monument.  Because I-17 is the major route north, it does a large amount of car and truck traffic, especially during busy weekends and holidays.  During the week, portions of I-17 can experience very heavy traffic due to commuters.   The Apache Trail (Hwy. 88) is a 42-mile long scenic drive through the Sonoran Desert.  It goes out to Theodore Roosevelt Lake and the mining town of Globe.  Along the way are ample views of yuccas, saguaros and desert lakes.</field>

		<field name="content">Washington DC Metro . The Metro system is considered one of the cleanest and most efficient in the world. The Orange, Blue, and Yellow lines serve Arlington. The Metro uses either a proximity card or a paper farecard; cards are available for purchase at vending machines in all stations. Users can also purchase a one day ($14) or seven-day ($35)  pass  to allow unlimited trips during a specified time.  Handle your farecard gently; its thin (like a business card) and the magnetic strip cant take a lot of abuse. Fares start at $1.60 and are based on distance and time of day. Arlington has grown around its Metro lines so many of the attractions you can see are located in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor or along the Blue/Yellow Lines. Accessing Washington, D.C. attractions from Arlington hotels along the Metro line can be as convenient as staying in Washington, D.C. itself.</field>

Arlington features a unique network of dedicated bike paths that crisscross the county as well as dedicated bike lanes on many major roads. The paths are well labeled and patrolled regularly for safety. They also offer beautiful scenery and the chance to ride your bike or walk without interruption form motorized vehicles. You can cross any of the bridges into Washington using your bike, but be aware that the Teddy Roosevelt Bridge has a very narrow bath with barely any protection from the interstate right next to you. Note that children are required to wear helmets, and its probably a good idea if you wear one too.  Many persons visiting Washington, D.C. choose to stay in Arlington. Arlington hotels located along the metro lines are just as convenient or even more convenient than hotels in Washington proper, and often more reasonable in price. If you are staying in Arlington primarily to see Washington sights such as the Smithsonian, it would be more convenient to leave your car parked at your hotel and ride the metro to Washington.</field>

		<field name="content">Asheville Transit  provides bus service that is regular but infrequent outside of downtown; inside downtown walking is almost always faster. Buses run from 6AM-11:30PM Monday through Saturday. Routes radiate from the Transit Center, located downtown at 49 Coxe Avenue next to the U.S. Post Office. Bus fare is $1 for adults and $0.50 for seniors and riders with disabilities. A "fare-free" zone exists in the downtown area containing almost all of the businesses, restaurants and attractions of downtown. Riders can take any bus in the system within the Free Zone at no charge.</field>

		<field name="content">Visitors will find todays Atlanta very walkable, with many improvements made in the last decade. Most of the in-town neighborhoods are individually easy to walk around, with dense collections of bars, restaurants, and shops. In particular, getting around within Midtown, Downtown, Decatur, Buckhead, or the areas around the North Highland Avenue corridor in East Atlanta (including Virginia-Highland, Poncey Highland, and Little Five Points) is usually quite easy; walking times rarely exceed 10ndash;20 minutes, and buses or trains provide some relief for longer trips. Getting between those neighborhoods solely by foot is more difficult; for example, expect a 30ndash;45 minute walk between Midtown and Virginia-Highland. Inter-neighborhood transportation is best done by car or public transit.</field>

		<field name="name">bus routes</field>
		<field name="content">In addition to the train network, there are a few buses which are particularly useful for getting around some of the in-town neighborhoods:   110 "The Peach"  ndash; This bus traverses Peachtree Street/Road from Downtown to Buckhead. Although most trips along this corridor will be easier and faster using the train, this bus is still especially useful for getting to a destination between Arts Center Station and Buckhead, including the Buckhead Village, which is 20-minute walk from Buckhead Station.   36  ndash; Useful connection to Virginia-Highland from Midtown Station. Beyond Virginia-Highland, this bus continues north and then east, stopping at Emory University, then traversing many residential neighborhoods before ending at Avondale Station east of Decatur.   16  ndash; Leaves from Five Points Station in Downtown first eastward, passing the Carter Center, then turning onto North Highland Avenue and heading north to Virginia-Highland and beyond into the northeastern reaches of the city. Before turning onto North Highland Avenue, this bus runs roughly parallel to Highland Avenue in close proximity, and it follows North Highland Avenue through its most active areas, so this is a good route to get between destinations along that corridor.   2  ndash; Leaves from North Avenue Station heading east and actually operates on two slightly different routes. Most of these follow Ponce de Leon Avenue and head briefly south and east along North Highland Avenue and Freedom Parkway before going along Moreland Avenue (through Little Five Points) and continuing to Edgewood/Candler Park Station. Once an hour, however, the bus will continue along Ponce (instead of turning down North Highland Avenue) and eventually reach Decatur Station. This route is useful for getting to parts of North Highland Avenue and to Little Five Points (both of which will be short walks regardless of which route the bus takes), and the hourly detour can be useful as well for reaching parts of Decatur which are further removed from the MARTA station.   12  ndash; Leaves from Midtown Station and heads west along 10th Street past Georgia Tech. Turns north along Howell Mill Road and continues into far northwestern parts of the city. This can be useful for getting to the west end of Georgia Tech campus or for getting to the fairly recently developed West Midtown district (near Howell Mill and Marietta Street and continuing for some time along Howell Mill), where many restaurants, boutique shops, bars, coffee shops, and art galleries are located.   1  ndash; Leaves from Five Points Station heading northwest, passes the Aquarium, CNN Center, and World of Coca-Cola (if you dont want to make the 10 minute walk), stops by Georgia Tech, and also passes through West Midtown before heading into far northwestern parts of the city.   6  ndash; Runs from Inman Park Station in the East to Lindbergh Station in the North. It first travels along Moreland Avenue (which becomes Briarcliff Road, on which it continues) with stops in Little Five Points (providing a shortcut there if the 10ndash;15 minute walk is too much) offering short walks to much of Poncey Highlands. It also has stops at Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control.  Note for weekend travel: MARTA runs slower on the weekends. Typical wait times are 20 minutes for trains and up to an hour for buses. Be sure to accommodate for this.</field>

		<field name="content">Look for these characteristic Marta signs   Atlanta is served by  MARTA  (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), +1 404-848-4711, which operates both rapid rail and bus networks in the city of Atlanta and the counties of Fulton and Dekalb.   Breeze Card   A single ride on MARTA costs $2.50; the fare includes transfers. MARTA uses wireless Breeze Cards to store your fare; a new card costs $1.00 but is reloadable and valid for 10 years. (Breeze Cards cant be shared; you need one per person.) Breeze Cards are sold in vending machines at all rail stations or at RideStores at Airport, Lindbergh Center, and Five Points Stations. When starting the journey by bus, tap the card at the fare post next to the driver. When starting the journey by train, tap the card at the fare gate; your cash-depleted card will now act as your transfer. When transferring to a bus or train, simply tap your card again. (The card uses RFID technology, so you can leave it in your wallet and just tap your whole wallet on the sensor.)  Buses accept fares in cash, but cannot issue transfers on fares paid in cash mdash; you must have a Breeze Card to obtain the transfer. If you plan to make a connection from bus to train, make sure to get one.  Unlimited passes are available ($9 for 1 day, $19 for 4 days, $23.75 for 7 days).  These will easily save you money if you plan on making more than one or two trips per day.  The system is quite safe regardless of the time of day, although there have been a handful of incidents of violent crime in the last decade. Like in any other city or transit system, use common sense, keep aware of your surroundings during low ridership periods, and avoid train cars with no other riders or with only a couple of other riders.  The rail network is comprised of four lines: Red, Gold, Blue, and Green.  The Red and Gold lines run north-south, while the Blue and Green lines run east-west, forming a cross with Five Points Station in the center.  The Red and Gold lines run on the same rails from a southern terminus at Hartsfield-Jackson airport through Downtown and Midtown Atlanta, before splitting into two branches: the Red line runs to north metro Atlanta at North Springs Station, and the Gold line runs northeast and terminates at Doraville Station.  The Blue line runs from a western terminal at Hamilton E.nbsp;Holmes to an eastern terminal at Indian Creek. The Green line runs east-west along with the Blue line, but has a small spur to Bankhead station and only goes as far east as Edgewood/Candler Park station. The Five Points station in downtown Atlanta is the only station where passengers may change trains between the Red-Gold and Blue-Green lines. Trains run from 5AM until 1AM Monday-Friday, and from 5AM until 12:30AM on weekends and holidays. Trains run on all lines every 12 minutes during peak periods, and every 20 minutes at night and on weekends. Note that the wait is often shorter than this for trips in the center of the city, as you will not have to wait for any specific train; you could take either the Red line or the Gold line to get from Downtown to Midtown, for example.  The bus network comprises over one hundred different bus routes, with many routes operating approximately every 20 minutes. Bus service on some lines (generally including the most popular tourist areas) runs from 5AM until 1:30AM Monday-Friday and from 5AM until 1AM on the weekends and holidays.</field>

		<field name="content">Cars are the most popular form of transport to get around the sprawling city, and usually the fastest during non-peak hours.  Many destinations outside the urban centers are only accessible by car.  Rush hour peaks around 7:30AM–9:30AM and 4PM-6:30PM on weekdays and often results in congestion when traveling inbound in the mornings and outbound in the afternoons.  Downtown/Midtown and major shopping districts such as Buckhead can also get crowded on weekends.  In the most urban areas, many restaurants and shops in the area offer complimentary or low-cost valet services ($1–3 tip expected) and on the rare occasion where parking is scarce, public lots are usually nearby for a fee.  In most of the city, though, parking is free and plentiful.  Free road maps are available at   .   Real-time traffic information  is available online or by dialing 511 from any phone.  Street names in Atlanta are very confusing. There are more than 70 streets that have "Peachtree" in their name, and they are often difficult to distinguish (Peachtree Street, Peachtree Lane, West Peachtree Street, etc.). When someone says "Peachtree" without clarifying, they mean Peachtree Street, a major north-south thoroughfare through Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead. Do not confuse it with West Peachtree Street, which parallels Peachtree Street a block away and is a major road through Midtown.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown Auburn is easily traversable on foot. The sidewalks and pedestrian crossings in and near downtown are heavily utilized by Auburns student population which means that cars will often stop if they see a pedestrian waiting at a crosswalk.  However, the further one gets from downtown, the greater the distances become. Eventually, you will need to reconcile yourself to using car or bicycle.  Areas outside of Downtown and north Auburn, especially areas along South College and Wire Road, lack sidewalks and pedestrian crossings and are not suitable for pedestrian traffic.</field>

		<field name="content">Bicycles are a common method of transportation in Auburn, allowing one to cover longer distances than when on foot. Most areas in Auburn can be reached by a short bike ride of any other point. Auburn was voted a "bicycle friendly city" by the league of American Bicyclists because of the citys bike plan, bike lanes, and advocacy efforts. Both the City of Auburn and Auburn University have established bicycle committees.   Be aware that Auburn City Police will occasionally cite bicyclists for riding on the sidewalk. In Auburn (like the rest of the U.S.), bikes are considered traffic just like cars, though drivers will often ignore bicyclists. Be aware of your surroundings.  A unique transportation option in the downtown area are pedicabs. TigerShaw    gives people around campus and downtown a chance to rest their feet if they dont feel like walking a mile to their destination. This service is available to Auburn Citizens and Auburn University Students.</field>

Austin is hilly to the west but generally mildly sloping toward the river in the center of town.  There are bike lanes on most major streets.  Biking is a great way to get around year round and the weather is usually agreeable from mid-October to mid-April. May to mid-October temperatures may reach the high 90s to 100s and humidity may be a problem.    Yellow Bike Project, Phone: 512-457-9880   .

Coordinators are present to answer any questions and guide you, but not to fix your bike for you.  At the Main Shop on 51st street there are 10+ work stands and tools sets available for use.  The Satellite Shop is better for minor repairs and only has as a few work stands.  If you are looking for a cheap bike while in town  and are willing to do a little maintenance work, visit The Yellow Bike Project and pick out a bike that needs a little love in exchange for a small donation.

Visitors can also get around on the Capital MetroRail commuter train which operates on weekdays between Downtown and northwest Austin.  Local fares cost $1.00 per trip, or you can get a 24 hour pass for $2.00 on board every bus (express and 2 zone MetroRail fares are $2.75, $5.50 for a day pass).  "E-Bus" and "Night Owl" services serve the citys entertainment districts after hours. Expect a 1 1/2 hour bus ride from any point north of 183 to downtown.  The Capital Metro website has a trip planner which can be used to find public transport options between two points in Austin.  Austin has a generally mediocre public transit system. However, the bus can be a viable method of getting around with proper planning ahead of time.  The University of Texas shuttles offer frequent free service between the University and some neighborhoods during weekdays when school is in session.</field>

Worse yet, vehicles illegally parked in private parking areas are very quickly towed, so make sure that you dont park in spots marked no parking.   Parking is free in the Texas State History Museum garage near UT after hours and on weekends. As of 2005 under SB 1533, state employees may park in state garages during non-business hours for free.</field>

There is only one true major east-west freeway in Austin, located south of the city center, known as Ben White or US 290 West/Texas highway 71.  The freeway section of 290 West/Ben White currently runs from I-35 to just east of Oak Hill.  Freeway extensions are currently being constructed east on 71 to the airport, and the beginning stages of construction are taking place west towards and past Oak Hill. Hwy 183 runs from the southeast corner of the city near the airport to the northwest suburbs, bridging Mopac and I-35 in North Austin.   Oak Hill  is the point at which TX 71 and US 290 split apart and go in separate directions, and in case this isnt confusing enough, some people make the distinction between 290 West and 290 East because at I-35, 290 East actually heads up the interstate, and then continues on to the east in North Austin.  There is a second freeway that runs from the Northwest side of the city down to the Southeast side of the city past the airport.  This freeway is called US 183, and in North Austin it may also be referred to as Research Boulevard.  Most of it is freeway now, however there are still several major intersections which are currently being constructed and turned into freeway.   I-35 has no loop that circumnavigates the city, so watch out for aggressive, confused drivers.  Also, keep your eyes open for the upper deck/lower deck split between Airport Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard; its confusing, and accidents occur there frequently.  Drivers going through Austin without stopping, or those who wish to avoid the chaos of the lower deck, should use the right two lanes as the deck split approaches, in contrast to other cities where through traffic uses the left lane. On the northbound side, traffic entering I-35 at Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard goes directly to the upper deck.  Out-of-towners be warned: on-ramps on I-35, especially the lower deck, are very short.  Austin has a mostly completed network of toll roads, see Central Texas Turnpike System    and Central Texas Regional Mobile Authority   . These include SH 130, an Austin bypass east of town; SH 45, an east-west artery in North Austin; the North MoPac extension; the US 183A bypass of Cedar Park and Leander; and SH 45SE in far south Austin. TxTag    accounts are available for commuters.  There has been significant opposition and accommodations have been made in some areas.  Both US 183A and MoPac are rather deceptive — if you keep going north on either 183 or MoPac, the freeway seamlessly transitions into a toll road and the signing is rather poor. To avoid the toll, you must keep a sharp eye out and get off the main lanes. Even worse, all tolls on 183A are "TxTag Only" meaning that you cannot pay cash.  This trend will likely extend to all Austin tollways in the near future.  Parts of the city are subject to flooding at times during the year; however, it is not too common as Austin does not usually get an excessive amount of rain. The year 2007 saw several flood episodes with the worst effects in Marble Falls, northwest of the city. See City of Austin Flood History    for historic flooding.  For those of you unfamiliar with proper treatment of flooded areas, NEVER drive through flooded low water crossings.  You will lose your car and possibly your life.  As little as a few inches of running water can and does wash a car away and each year there are some deaths due to this. "Turn Around, Dont Drown."</field>

		<field name="content">The light rail by Camden Station   Public transportation in Baltimore is nothing spectacular. Fares to ride light rail, buses and subway are $1.60 each way, and $3.50 buys you a day pass that gets you unlimited rides on all three. You can buy the pass from any bus operator or vending machine at subway/light rail stations.  As a general rule, the  light rail  system is far more useful for getting into the city than getting around it.  You may wish to park outside the city (for free!) and take the light rail in. The one useful section runs from  Camden Yards  up past  Lexington Market  to the  Station North Arts District .  There is also a single line  subway  which runs from Johns Hopkins Hospital, through downtown, and out to the northwest suburbs of Pikesville and Owings Mills.  The subway does not pass many tourist destinations and is mostly used by commuters.  To get around Baltimore on the cheap by public transport, especially outside of the harbor area, you will sacrifice convenience, but the MTA buses are the way to go. MTA puts out very handy  interactive maps  of the downtown and regional bus routes, so you can plan ahead. Buses, like all of Baltimores public transit, are well patrolled and safe.</field>

		<field name="content">Unlike the MTA, the recently launched  Charm City Circulator  is a city-run service. And unlike the MTA, the Circulator is free.  Funded by parking taxes, several routes are now online. The Orange Route runs east to west from Hollins Market to Harbor East. The Purple Route runs north to south between Penn Station and Federal Hill.  A third route, The Green Route, runs mostly east of downtown, serving Power Plant Live, Fells Point, and the Johns Hopkins medical complex.  The Banner Route, running from the Inner Harbor to Ft. McHenry hits the roads in June 2012. The buses, smaller and quieter than the MTA trains, but more stylish and fun to ride, are ideal for people staying downtown looking for a very economical way to get out towards Fells Point, Federal Hill, Mount Vernon and other areas underserved by the MTA.  If staying outside the city and taking Light Rail or Metro Subway in, the ?Circulator routes were thankfully designed to coordinate with key stops like Baltimore Street, North Howard Street (along which the Light Rail runs), Charles Center and the Convention Center.</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">You don’t need a car to visit Baltimore, but it helps, especially if you’re planning to visit some of the more outlying areas of the city which are poorly served by public transit.  Baltimore has an incomplete freeway system: protests in the 1970s halted the construction of a proposed east-west freeway that would have destroyed neighborhoods including historic Fells’ Point, so I-83 (known within the city as the "Jones Falls Expressway") and I-395 both terminate downtown without connecting to each other.  This accounts for heavy traffic downtown during rush hours and on game days.  Pratt and Lombard streets can be particularly slow due to the confluence of car and pedestrian traffic around the harbor.  If you’re headed east or west across downtown, it’s often quicker to drive a few blocks north to take U.S. Route 40, even if your destination is south of Route 40.  Streets in the central region of the city follow a grid pattern, with alternating one-way streets in many neighborhoods, particularly downtown and on the East Side.  In the outer parts of the city, the street pattern becomes more suburban, centered around radial roads.  Charles Street divides “East” streets from “West,” and Baltimore Street divides “North” from “South” (early city planners clearly had no idea of how far north the city would grow!).  Streets that don’t cross Charles Street or Baltimore Street don’t have a directional label.  Most Baltimore street signs have the block number on them, which helps with navigation.  It’s not hard to find paid parking garages and lots near all major sights in the city center, usually charging parking rates commensurate with proximity to the Inner Harbor.  Beyond the central neighborhoods, on-street parking is widely available.  You pay for street parking at electronic kiosks which take your money (they accept cash or credit cards) and issue a receipt stating the time at which your parking will expire, which you display on your dashboard.  Parking enforcement in Baltimore is known to be ruthless.  If you dont have a car, Baltimore has several reliable taxi companies.  Taxi fares start at $1.80 and increase by $.20 for each 1/11 mile ($2.20 per mile) or for 30 seconds of waiting time.  It’s easy to hail a cab on the street downtown, in Fell’s Point and Mt. Vernon, but elsewhere you’ll have to call.</field>

		<field name="content">One of the most popular (and unique!) modes of transportation in Baltimore is the  water taxi  system +1 410 563-3901. Rarely a useful mode of transport for everyday life, it is an especially nice way of touring the citys main sights for a day (and admiring the skyline from the water). From May–September, it stops throughout the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, Fort McHenry, and even Canton, at intervals of about 15–20 minutes. Day passes, adults: $9.00, kids under 10: $4.00.  In cooperation with the Charm City Circulator system, some routes across the harbor are also free from 7 AM to 7 PM, including Maritime Park, Tide Point, and Canton Waterfront Park.</field>

		<field name="content">Biking is a fun way to explore Baltimore’s neighborhoods as well as an activity in itself.  Scenic areas to explore by bike include the affluent neighborhoods of  North Baltimore , the Gwynns Falls Trail and Druid Hill Park on the  West Side , and  East Baltimore ’s Patterson Park.  The city center is fairly flat, although the northern part of the city can get quite hilly.  Although Baltimore hasn’t achieved the bicycle-friendliness of its neighbor to the south, the city government is making an effort, slowly installing new bike lanes and marked bicycle routes.  Drivers are generally tolerant, although some are liable to pass uncomfortably close (Maryland law requires drivers to allow at least 3 feet when passing a bicyclist, but it’s rarely enforced).  The city publishes a handy  Bicycle Map , available online and in print at bike shops.  You can bring bicycles on Metro and Light Rail (but not MARC) trains.  All MTA buses (but not the Circulator) have a front-loading bike rack.  Three excellent bike shops are located in areas frequented by visitors:  Light Street Cycles , located at 1124 Light Street in Federal Hill, less than a mile walk from the Inner Harbor;  Baltimore Bicycle Works , at 1813 Falls Road near Penn Station; and  Joe’s Bike Shop  at 723 S. Broadway in Fells Point.  Light Street Cycles and Baltimore Bicycle Works offer bike rentals by the day.  Baltimore’s bike scene has an irreverent side.  Instead of a Critical Mass ride (where large groups of cyclists take over the street during rush hour to promote biking), Baltimore has the  Baltimore Bike Party , a slow-paced, carousing mass ride replete with costumed riders, decorated bikes, and noisemakers.  The Bike Party meets at 7pm at the Washington Monument in Mt. Vernon the last Friday of every month; there’s always an afterparty (and sometimes a pre-party) with food and beer.  Bicycle theft is a serious concern.  You must have a strong, solid lock—a cable lock makes your bike easy prey.  In 2010 and 2011 there were reports of gangs assaulting cyclists and stealing their bikes after dark in the area between Midtown and Charles Village, North Avenue to 25th Street.  Although such reports have been less frequent in the past couple years, it’s safest to stick to well-lit, heavily-travelled streets after dark.</field>

That said, in the town you can get around very easily on a bike on the paved roads near town.    If youre up for a gravel road bike adventure then Beaver Island is a great spot with lots of areas to explore. Beautiful sandy beaches and also trails through old growth forests. The island is about 14 miles long, in fact its shaped a lot like the island of Ireland. Its a nice and friendly place to visit.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Cars are most useful far away from downtown (i.e. not near the campus) or in Berkeleys steep hills.  Its often better to stay on the main roads unless you know your way because of the many road barriers to prevent through traffic in residential areas. Be mindful of cyclists and pedestrians; many cyclists often ride in lanes (as is their legal right in California), and pedestrians may expect cars to stop for them. Remember that as a motorist, you need to be especially cautious in order to avoid harming cyclists and pedestrians. Be very careful when driving near the University as students tend to have the mindset that they have the right of way. To further confuse drivers many roads near the university are one way roads (and can turn so spontaneously - so watch signs at major intersections) or are closed to certain drivers.  Parking can be difficult and expensive near campus and downtown. The easiest and most expensive means of parking is in one of the several garages. The biggest garage near campus is the Telegraph Channing Garage. Many stores on Telegraph have validation coupons discounting hourly parking 50% or $5 off all-day parking. Arrive after 8PM and pay only $4 night rate until closing. Most street parking is either metered or 2-hour, but free after 6 p.m. . If you are visiting a resident, they can purchase one day, 7-day, or 21-day street parking passes (not valid in metered spots) for you at city services in downtown. If you are fortunate to find a non-metered street parking close to your destination, you can park for free—some people are known to wipe off the chalk mark left by the meter maid (normally back of rear tire) every three hours or so. Be warned: This is not legal. In an extreme emergency (i.e., ten minutes late for your final exam), you can almost always find parking near the UC Berkeley police station near Sproul Hall. You might get a ticket, but youll definitely get a kick-ass parking spot. Be aware of street sweeping signs, street sweeping is usually once a month, but the day varies from street to street (even from one side of the street to the other), a good rule of thumb is that if it seems like the street parking on one side is too good to be true - double check it isnt street sweeping. City parking fines run from $48 (Street sweeping and lack of permit in 2 hours spot) to over $300 (Disabled spot violations) and city parking enforcement is particularly vigilant so be aware - you can and will get multiple tickets for the same violation if you dont move quickly (parking 30 minutes in the 5 minute yellow zone can yield 5 $80 tickets).   The Eastshore Freeway which runs along the citys western edge is part of a short concurrency of I-80 and I-580 that may confuse some drivers. Heading south on the freeway toward the Bay Bridge and San Francisco, drivers are simultaneously following I-80 west and I-580 east. Drivers unfamiliar with the area should ensure they know whether their destination is toward Oakland and San Francisco or toward Richmond and Sacramento. These cities supplement the route designations at entrances to this freeway.</field>

		<field name="content">Public transportation is thus an important consideration in getting to and around downtown and near the university. BART is the fastest connection to Oakland and San Francisco.  The Berkeley BART station located in Downtown Berkeley is usually the best option for travelers; the Ashby station is in a seedier part of South Berkeley and the North Berkeley station is located in a residential neighborhood near University Ave.  AC Transit goes places BART doesnt, such as the trendy Fourth Street commercial district (line 51B), the upscale Rockridge neighborhood (line 51B to 51A) and the resurgent Temescal commercial district in nearby North Oakland (line 1 or 1R).

		<field name="content">Weather permitting, the best way to get around quickly near downtown Berkeley or near campus is on  bicycle . Bicycle theft is a serious problem in Berkeley; if you ride your bike, be sure to lock your front wheel as well as the frame. Some choose to remove the seat as well, however this precaution is likely unnecessary if you are only leaving your bike for a short period of time and not overnight. AC Transit buses have racks on the front for bicycles. Bicycles are allowed on BART, but not on San Francisco bound trains during morning rush hour, and do not bring your bicycle in the first car. Check with BART before you leave or youll get a warning from BART Police and forced to wait until permitted or else face a fine and a stern look from the officer. Folding bicycles are always allowed.</field>

		<field name="content">Lehigh and Northampton County Transportation Authority (LANTA) provides affordable bus transportation in and around Bethlehem and the surrounding cities of  Allentown  and  Easton . LANTA provides a Metro Plus service for those who are unable to ride the regular Metro due to disability or requirement of special attention. Schedules are available online   .  The majority of LANTA buses serve mainly to link the three downtown areas of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, and if youre not staying/going in these areas, the bus service can be impractical.  Service centers around the main depot at Broad Guetter Streets, and fans out in every direction.  The cost is $2 a ride, $3 for a day pass, with discounts if you buy in bulk.  The Bethlehem Loop is a shuttle bus from Center City to the South Side, including the Sands Casino Resort.  The prices for each ride are the same as LANTAs bus fares.  This will probably be the only bus youll need if youre just touristing.</field>

When referring to places along Main, "the top" of Main is at the intersection of Main and Broad, which is on top of a hill; "the bottom" is at the Brethrens House, and all points past there.  If you want to walk to the South Side (not recommended; save your feet by forking over the two bucks for the bus), go over the bridge at the bottom of Main next to the Hotel Bethlehem.  Make a left when you reach another bridge, the Hill-to-Hill Bridge.  When you get to the end of the bridge, turn left on 3rd or 4th St. to reach the South Side.  There are also several pathways which lead to the Monocacy Creek from Main St.</field>

		<field name="content">Bettendorf is generally an easy city to navigate, but it has a couple of quirks.  The city streets are basically laid out in a grid pattern, especially in the older part of town.  Some of the newer residential sections of the city do not follow a grid, however.  For the most part, east-west streets are named and the north-south streets are numbered starting at the border with Davenport.  There are a couple of exceptions.  Devils Glen Road is a north-south Street on the east side of town and 53rd Avenue is an east west street on the north side that connects with 53rd Street in Davenport.  Middle Road is a major thoroughfare through the middle of town as the name suggests.  However, it defies the grid pattern as it travels northeast from Locust Street in Davenport before it heads north to I-80.  Addresses on east-west streets are numbered from the west at the border with Davenport, and on north-south streets from Mississippi River toward Interstate 80.     The Quad Cities has a  wayfinding  color code system for signs that direct people to various venues and attractions in the area.  The area is divided into quadrants with their own colors and identifying headers on direction signs have the appropriate color for each quadrant so that travelers know, by color, which quadrant you are in and to which color you will have to travel to reach other attractions.  Bettendorf is in the northeast quadrant and its attractions are on signs that use the yellow color in the header.  The northwest quadrant (Davenport) is green, the southeast quadrant (Moline-East Moline) is blue and the southwest quadrant (Rock Island) is red.</field>

Surprisingly, the number one cause of fatalities in the park is drunk drivers mdash; dont become one yourself and add to the statistic. The parks network of unpaved backroads contain some routes suitable for any car, but some require a high-clearance or 4WD vehicle to drive safely.

		<field name="content">For traveling the park at a more relaxed pace, totally immersed in your surroundings, nothing beats a bike. No mountain biking is permitted but you have free access to all park roads, both paved and unpaved. Good options for novices are the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive and the road from Panther Junction to Rio Grande Village; both of which are downhill mdash; make sure to have a shuttle waiting at the other end unless youre prepared for the strenuous trip back up. The backroads offer the real adventure mdash; the Old Ore Road is a good choice for more experienced bikers. Biking is not common in the park yet, so most drivers will not be expecting you; be cautious on curves and after dark. Be sure to check your tires and bring a repair-kit, a good level of fitness, and plenty of water.  Desert Sports  offers bike rentals, tours, and shuttle services.</field>

Horses are restricted to the backcountry, which means paved roads, developed campsites and trails, and much of the Chisos Mountains are all off-limits. Grazing is not permitted, so food has to brought in. A good camping spot is at Government Springs (Hannold Draw), which has a corral (large enough to accommodate 8 horses) and lies about 5nbsp;mi (8nbsp;km) north of Panther Junction.</field>

		<field name="title">Boston</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Driving is to be avoided if possible, due to traffic congestion, poor parking options, high driving-associated costs, the complexity of navigation, notoriously aggressive drivers, brazen jaywalkers, difficult-to-follow city rules and signage, and the simple fact that Boston, with the exception of neighborhoods on the periphery such as Dorchester and Mattapan, is very compact.  As an alternative (in fair weather), walking is usually preferable in terms of ease, cost, and comfort. Boston is an all right city to walk because most destinations are very close together, and downtown rapid transit stops, or T stops, are frequent.  Signage is generally poor, and the names of major streets are usually unmarked when crossing minor streets. There are many one-way streets, which may be difficult to identify when turning.  Street names are duplicated in different neighborhoods (due to municipal consolidations in the 1800s and early 1900s).  Even Bostonians who lived there all their life can easily get lost.  Navigating from "square" to "square" (major intersections but rarely actually square or really any consistent shape) is one navigational technique.  Some parts of the city are difficult to reach from other nearby parts, prompting the local expression, "Ya caint get theyah from hee-ah!" ("You cant get there from here!")  Avoid driving at morning or evening rush hour; highways and streets can become quite congested. Peak times vary, depending on relative distance from downtown. Public transit also becomes very crowded during rush hour, and just before and after major sporting events and public celebrations. Baseball games, other major sporting events, and graduations may also cause significant driving congestion.  If you do choose to drive, be prepared to avoid double-parked vehicles or poorly parked vehicles blocking lanes, and be wary of lanes which may suddenly become parking lanes or shift or disappear entirely as you cross intersections. "Left lane must turn" and other traffic directions are often written only on the road itself and therefore may be routinely blocked from sight by other vehicles in heavy traffic, thus last-second lane changes are unavoidable without foreknowledge of the roads. Such changes may be the cause of anger or disputes, so it may be good to wave or request a lane change politely.  When changing lanes, be wary of pedestrians and cyclists, as well as other drivers, since they may cross, split lanes, or even run lights unexpectedly. Massachusetts law requires vehicles to yield to pedestrians, whether or not theyre crossing legally. Bicycles are treated as vehicles, and may occupy an entire lane if there is no bike lane. As in any city, be prepared to stop when following a taxi driver, and look for pedestrians to anticipate taxi behavior: taxis will not only stop at fares but also stop at nothing to get to them first. When stopping yourself, use your hazards to clearly indicate that you are stopping as a courtesy to other drivers, many of whom are young students and may be inexperienced with city driving themselves. In terms of the law: if you encounter a rotary, remember that Massachusetts state law gives the right of way to traffic in a rotary, also known as a roundabout in other parts in the world.  Do not pass stopped trolleys on the right; do not try to squeeze past a bus without changing lanes entirely to avoid sharing their lane (you should not pass any vehicle while sharing a lane and buses have large blind spots); and be wary that the law may require you to come to a complete stop and wait for the pedestrian to finish crossing entirely. Be careful also not to pass a yellow school bus with red flashing lights as passing before or after may still draw you a citation (this rule may be ignored, even by police, if due caution is observed by the driver, but those who ignore it may still draw a serious citation). Finally, since you may cross train tracks in Boston, be aware that they may be particularly slippery and icy, possibly dragging you off course as you cross them if you do not grip the steering wheel firmly.  The only toll road in the area is the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), with various prices depending on entrance and exit points. Other tolls include the Ted Williams and Sumner Tunnels, each of which charges $3.50 when coming back from Logan Airport into downtown.  The Tobin Bridge on Route 1 headed southbound toward downtown charges $3. Have cash on hand for these roads as checks and credit card are not accepted there. FastLane and E-Z Pass are also accepted.  Parking Parking can be expensive, up to $40/day downtown on a weekday, though $20 and $7 deals can be found if you are willing to walk.  Most cheap or free street parking is permitted as resident only and requires a special sticker, or is metered and has a 2-hour time limit.  Parallel parking is a necessary skill for street parking.  Believe it or not, you can park in a space that is only a few inches larger than your car, if you dont mind scrapes on your bumpers and take advantages of the bounciness of cars suspensions.  Garages are located at Quincy Market, the Aquarium, the new State Street Financial Center, the Theater District and the  Boston Common .  There are three levels of parking under the Common.  The garage is very clean and its central location makes it a good starting point for a day trip in the city.  To get in and out of the garage, there are four pavilions on the Common; each has stairs and an elevator.  Once out of the garage, the Park Street and Boylston Street T stops are only a two or three minute walk away.  As a rule, if you think you may be illegally parked, you probably are. Read the street signs very carefully. Watch for street cleaning, resident-only parking zones, and commercial parking zones - all of which will vary depending on the day and time. Parking meters are enforced heavily throughout the city.  Meters in different parts of the city will turn off at different times (i.e. 8PM downtown or 6PM in many other neighborhoods). A broken meter entitles you to the posted time limit without having to pay.</field>

		<field name="content">The rapid transit lines of the MBTA system.  (Bus, commuter rail, and boat not shown.)   Public transit in Boston is plentiful for an American city of its size, and is useful in getting around the city, especially considering the issues with driving.  A single public transit agency serves the Boston metropolitan area, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ("MBTA", or "the T" for short). The MBTA is the fourth-largest transit system in the U.S. For complete schedules, maps, and other information, see their  official website .  It is important to note that "Inbound" means toward Park Street or State and "Outbound" means away from Park Street or State.  After decades of using tokens for fare payment, the entire MBTA system was converted in 2007 to an electronic CharlieCard and CharlieTicket system.  Dispensing machines at all stations accept cash, credit cards, and debit cards.  If you go straight to a dispensing machine, youll get a paper CharlieTicket with magnetic stripe.  If you have time, first ask an attendant at any underground station for a plastic CharlieCard, which is a contactless "smart card".  The Card is free and will give you a discount on all T and bus fares, and its the only way to get free transfers to and from buses. If you think youll be boarding the T many times you may wish to purchase a day or week LinkPass (Sold at standard machines for $11.00 and $18.00, respectively). Note that these do not allow rapid repeated use at the same station, for a group, for instance. In general, a CharlieCard should be considered a must for its convenience (you can leave it in your wallet), decreased fares, and free or discounted transfers. Most passes (but not one and seven day passes) can be loaded onto a  CharlieCard . Unfortunately, CharlieCards are oftentimes not available at stations. However, almost all 7-11 convenience stores in the Boston area sell them, and you can find other places to buy CharlieCards on the MBTAs website.  Bicycles are sometimes possible to transport on the MBTA. Bikes are allowed on the Blue, Red, and Orange T lines except at peak hours, but are not allowed on the Green and Silver lines.  Bikes are always allowed on MBTA buses that are equipped with bike racks. The MBTA is currently installing bike racks on many bus routes - check the MBTA website for the latest updates. Bikes are allowed on MBTA boats and ferries at any time.  On commuter rail trains, they are allowed anytime except weekday rush hours, as noted on individual train line schedules.  The MBTA system consists of several components: T, bus, water shuttles, and commuter rail.  Full-color system maps are available at major stations; you may need to ask an agent if you would like one.  They are extremely useful for locals and travelers getting a bit off the beaten track, because they show all bus, rapid transit, commuter rail, and boat lines. Most of the T maps you will see only show the rapid transit lines, which are identified by color.  If you have a color printer, you can make one yourself by printing the PDF version online. ( Front ,  back .)  Light heavy rail, or the T  Subway train at North Station  The T is composed of four color-coded rail lines, the Red Line, Orange Line, Green Line, and Blue Line. The Green Line is technically an above ground streetcar system, although downtown the stops are often underground. It uses light-rail or streetcar/trolley rolling stock, stops frequently, is powered using overhead lines, and never goes above 45 miles an hour. Despite this, it carries a surprising amount of passengers and is without a doubt the most useful T line for tourists. The newer Silver Lineis technically part of the T system, but in reality is comprised of diesel-electric buses with the ability to run on track and draw current from an overhead wire.  The Green Line splits into four branches going west that are known as the B, C, D and E lines (from north to south).  Going west on the Green Line, the E line branches off at Copley Square station, the other three split at Kenmore Square station.  Just after the lines split, these lines all run above ground and become "streetcar" lines.  The B branch is a service to Boston College via Commonwealth Avenue (locally referred to and sometimes marked as Comm Ave). It services Boston College and Boston University, along with the neighborhood of Brighton. Many of the stops are dangerously close to the road; some are just painted yellow lines in the middle of Comm Ave and the right of way. Its long distance and frequent grade crossings cause dispatchers to express trains frequently. B stops are extremely close together, even for Boston. Expect a journey on the B branch to take a while. Make sure to press the stop tape to request your stops, as many drivers wont stop unless they are requested past Boston University or even past Kenmore.  The C branch is a service to Cleveland Circle via Beacon Street. This line is primarily in  Brookline . Its right of way is mainly surrounded by local businesses and residential structures. Like with the B branch, stops are very close together, upon occasion literally only 1 block apart.  The D branch is a service to Riverside Station, an inter-model station in Newton, MA, via the Highland Branch. A former street care right of way from the 1800s. The right of way is completely grade separated (does not intersect or run along streets) making transportation faster, with stops being further apart.  The E branch is a service to VA Medical Center and Heath Street, via Huntington Avenue. This line services the Prudential Center, and Bostons Symphony Hall. Along with many universities along the right of way, including the world famous Longwood Medical Area, which is a commercial and education complex offering some of the most advanced health care in the world, along with research centers. Also the Museum of Fine Arts Boston is accessible via the Museum of Fine Arts stop, sometimes announced as MFA or Museum on the trolley. However, the E branch is less accessible and frequent from downtown, and its nigh impossible to transfer to other C lines from the E branch.  The letters are not assigned to coincide with any particular reference to the route of the branch. It is labeled A-E (A disbanded, now the 57 bus) from north to south. Cleveland Circle (C), Reservoir (D), and Chestnut Hill Ave (B) stops are all in walking distance and provide a convenient spot to switch between the lines; however a second fare is required.  The Red Line  splits in two directions at the JFK/UMass station going south that are known as the Braintree and Ashmont branches, the latter of which connects to a streetcar line to Mattapan.  The Orange Line, the eldest of the rapid transit lines in Boston, is service from Malden, MA to Jamaica Plain. It services the City of Malden, Charlestown, Bunker Hill Community College, North Station, the Haymarket area, the Financial District, Downtown Crossing, New England Medical Center, Roxbury, and Jamaica Plain.  The Blue Line, named as such because it crosses under the Boston Harbor and goes to Revere Beach, is a former street car line converted to rapid transit. It services East Boston, the Airport, and Revere.   The T system is slightly confusing in that directions are often marked "inbound" and "outbound", rather than with a destination.  "Inbound" means "into the center of Boston", where all four lines converge at four stops: State (Blue and Orange), Park Street (Red and Green), Government Center (Blue and Green), and Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red). "Outbound" means "away from the center of Boston".  Once one is in the center, signs generally give the direction ("eastbound") or the last stop on the line in that direction ("Alewife").  All trains are signed with the last stop in the direction they are headed, and this is the best way to know if you are going in the right direction.  Note that most Green Line trains do not go all the way to the end of the line at Lechmere; most turn around either at North Station or Government Center. If you are traveling farther than Government Center, your best bet is to get on the first train that comes, and then wait on the platform at the stop where you are forced to leave the train until the next Lechmere or North Station train arrives. (Depending where you are, Lechmere trains might not stop there.) Only trains coming from the E Branch will proceed to Lechmere, unless otherwise noted. From North Station or Haymarket, its a fairly short walk to Lechmere.  T service generally does not run between 1 AM and 5AM.  (The same goes for the commuter rail lines - usually midnight or before.) Each line (Green, Blue, etc.) has a "last train" time, starting at one end of the line and going to the other.  Check the schedule in advance if you are going to be out late.  Sometimes the last train is delayed due to passenger load or the need to wait for the last connection from another line, so you might get lucky if you are running late.  Check with a T employee near the fare gates to see if youve missed the last train or not. A general rule of thumb is to be in the station by midnight to safely catch the last train. A consequence of this is that taxis can be extremely difficult to hail after 2AM when most of the bars close, especially in touristy areas such as Fanueil Hall.  Unlimited-ride T and bus passes are available from the MBTA.  If youre going to be riding a lot around town, these are worth investigating.  See the  link  for complete fare information on passes.  Buy a CharlieCard 1 day pass for $11 or a 7 day unlimited pass for $18. The 7-Day LinkPass is valid for 7 days from the date and time of purchase. The LinkPass gives you unlimited travel on T, Local Bus, Inner Harbor Ferry, and Commuter Rail Zone 1A.  (Note that Commuter Rail and boats do not accept CharlieCards, so you must use a CharlieTicket for these services.)  If using a CharlieCard, the cost of a one-way ride on the T is $2.00 plus free T and local bus transfers. Otherwise, it costs $2.50 per ride if done on a Charlie Ticket or paying by cash. This will get you to most destinations. Parking at the Alewife station on the Red line is ample but will cost you $7 each time you park, and $8 overnight. Riverside Station just off I-95 has plentiful parking for $6 all day.  Additional suburban parking is available in Quincy, Braintree, and at many Commuter Rail stops.  Bus Regular bus service (the vast majority of buses) is usually slower than rapid transit, but is also cheaper and may take you closer to your final destination.  Express buses are faster, more expensive, and travel longer distances.  CharlieCard users get free transfers and pay $1.50 for regular bus, $3.50 for Inner Express, and $5 for Outer Express (check the schedule to know which line is which).  Charlie Ticket or cash customers pay $2.00 for regular bus, $4.50 for Inner Express, and $6.50 for Outer Express, with no free transfers.  Water shuttle  Water Taxi  The MBTA runs a number of  water shuttles , but the most useful for tourists is the  shuttle  from Long Wharf to Navy Yard, which costs $1.70.  This provides a convenient connection between the USS Constitution Museum and the area around Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium.  Theres also a shuttle from Long Wharf to Logan Airport, but it runs relatively infrequently, so the Blue Line is your best bet for getting between these two destinations.  There are also non-MBTA public ferries available from several ports, notably the Aquarium and Long Wharf, and a water taxi service on the waterfront. The Boston Harbor Islands, an interesting destination for wildlife and scenery, are primarily accessed through private water shuttles which run every 30 minutes out of a stretch of the Rose Kennedy Greenway.  Commuter rail   Commuter rail  in Boston is primarily used for traveling to towns outside of the city. Due to its limited frequency compared to the T, it is not generally recommended for travel within the city itself. An exception is travel between Back Bay Station and South Station, which is served by 5 commuter rail branches on weekdays and is free one way. Commuter rail fares range from $1.70 to $7.75 one way, although any ticket to or from the city is at least $4.25.  Tickets can be bought on board trains, but at a slight surcharge. Passengers can ride for free from Back Bay to South Station, but must buy a ticket for $1.70 to travel from South Station to Back Bay.  Trains heading north of the city leave from North Station, while those heading south or west leave from South Station. Both stations have connections to the T: North Station is on the Green and Orange Lines, and South Station is on the Red and Silver Lines.  The two stations are not directly connected: you cannot board a train north of the city and take it to a point south of the city.  Such a journey will require a T ride in-between train trips to make the connection.</field>

		<field name="name">by taxi</field>
		<field name="content">Your current alternative to late-night public transit is a taxi.  Taxis can be hailed at any significant street corner, such as Kenmore Square or Copley Square.  Expect to spend at least $5 and possibly up to $30 in the immediate surroundings (this includes the initial fare, a small tip for the driver, small one-way streets, bad traffic, construction, tolls for bridges, tolls for tunnels, tolls for the Mass Pike, and any wait time). To get further out of Boston, expect to spend much more (for example, from the airport to  Wellesley , a Boston suburb, would be around $80, which includes the actual driving and tolls along the way). Fun fact, as of summer 2009, Boston has the most expensive taxis of any major American city.</field>

		<field name="content">Bostons downtown core is compact and easily walkable. Most tourist attractions can be visited on foot, although some neighborhoods require rail and/or bus connections. Take note that while jaywalking is technically illegal, the fine is $1 and tickets havent been issued for decades.  However, if you cross against signals just remember to watch out for stray bikes, cars, and some unusual traffic patterns you wont be used to.  The climate is cold from December to April, and the city is the most windy in America. Snow can also be an obstacle.  If its late at night, or you feel you cannot deal with the cost of a taxi or the wait involved with the MBTA, then Boston is a relatively small, relatively safe city and walking is an option. Just remember to use the same sense you would in any other city.</field>

		<field name="content">Many Boston residents use bicycling as their primary mode of transit all year round, and Bostons small size and relative flatness make biking an appealing way to get around.  Boston lacks many amenities for bicyclists, however, as the roads are covered with potholes and frequently absent of designated bicycle lanes or bicycle racks, so visitors wishing to travel by bicycle should have excellent urban riding skills prior to renting a bicycle. Cambridge tends to have more bicycle lanes and racks, though many streets still lack them. Riding on the sidewalk is illegal in the city of Cambridge, and frowned upon in Boston, and being well-lit in the evenings is important both for following regulations and for being safe.  Recent efforts by Mayor Thomas Menino promise increased city investment in bicycling as a viable mode of transportation, and the mayor himself has taken up biking around town.  A central transit for bikers in Boston is the Southwest Corridor Bike Path, a major park/bike way placed along a route once slated for a major freeway system. This runs parallel to the Ts Orange Line and connects Forest Hills to the Back Bay. This is an excellent means of transit if you intend on staying in Jamaica Plain.  On July 28, 2011, Boston launched   Hubway , a bike sharing system very similar to those in Washington D.C. and New York City, currently with 61 stations and 600 bicycles.  The cost is $5/day, $12/3 day pass, and $85 for a yearly membership.</field>

		<field name="content">Space Coast Area Transit  is the name of the local Brevard County bus service. It is a cheap way to get around and is handicap accessible. The website provides maps and timetables. Buses travel to most sites and places of interest at $1.25 per ride or $35 for a monthly pass. The bus service provides efficient, quick, and frequent stops within cities and local areas (both beachside and mainland) However, attractions in Brevard County are typically far apart (the county is narrow, but over 70 miles long from north to south), which is a challenge for the bus service. Getting from the south mainland (Palm Bay) to the beach via the sole bus route takes a long time (up to 2 hours) due to the many stops scheduled, as does the extended 1-2 hour trip from South Brevard up to Kennedy Space Center. A rental car is a good idea for travel outside your immediate city.</field>

		<field name="name">by subway</field>
		<field name="content">The subway is overall the best way to get around Brooklyn, although there are some spots, notably  Red Hook  and parts of  East Brooklyn  (including most of the tourist attractions), where subway coverage is poor and bus transportation is encouraged. Using Google Maps transit directions is an easy way to get accurate directions throughout Brooklyn (as well as the rest of NYC). However, do check the Metropolitan Transit Authoritys website    for service changes, as Google Maps tends to miss out on those. You can also use the subway map on MTAs website or pick one up for free at a station agents booth.  Brooklyn is well served by some 18  subway  lines. The biggest hub is Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center.  There you may transfer to most subway lines in Brooklyn (D, N, R, B, Q, 2, 3, 4, 5). In addition, the Fulton Street stop on the G line and Lafayette Avenue on the C line are close by, but require exiting and re-entering the subway system (only free if you have an unlimited ride Metrocard). Broadway Junction in Bed-Stuy and East New York is a minor hub between trains that dont stop at Atlantic Avenue.  Transferring there can be useful if youre going to Northern Brooklyn.  Coney Island is a major hub for D, F, N, and Q lines—its possible to do a "loop tour" of Southern Brooklyn by changing there. For example, taking the D to Coney Island and then the F back to Downtown (both elevated lines) will provide great views of residential Brooklyn.</field>

		<field name="name">by bus</field>
		<field name="content">Brooklyn has an extensive bus grid that proves very useful in accessing places where subway doesnt stop. The downside is that the buses are much slower than the subway (though not as slow as in Manhattan) and figuring out their route may be confusing. Its highly suggested to have a bus map handy (available free from any subway station agent) or to use Google Maps route planner, which incorporates bus directions very accurately.  As in the rest of New York City, some buses are limited (LTD) service, which means they skip certain stops along the route. However, even non-limited buses wont stop if the "Stop Request" light isnt on and no one is waiting at the bus stop (this is very common). If you plan to get off, make sure you press the "Stop Request" tape/button before you approach your stop, or else the bus may skip it.</field>

It isnt terribly convenient, due to the limited stops and relatively infrequent service, but if you need to go to exactly the areas it stops in, its faster than the subway.</field>

		<field name="content">Members of the  Zipcar  car-sharing program can access vehicles in the Buffalo area from both the North and South Campuses of the University at Buffalo. Another car-sharing option that may be of interest to longer-term visitors to Buffalo is  Buffalo CarShare . Buffalo CarShares rates range from $5 to $8 per hour depending on the level of membership, including 50 free miles (about 80 free km); cars are available for up to 36 hours at a time. A surcharge of 25¢ applies for each additional mile driven (about 16¢ for each additional km). Buffalo CarShares "hubs" are located in Allentown, University Heights, the Elmwood Village, the West Side, and near Canisius College. Membership in Buffalo CarShare begins at $5/month; prospective members must have been in possession of a valid drivers license for at least 2 years, have a valid credit card, and undergo a check of their driving record.</field>

		<field name="content">In addition to the Interstate highways mentioned in the "Get In" section, Buffalo has several intraurban expressways useful to visitors:  The Kensington Expressway (State Route 33) begins at the airport on Genesee Street, proceeding westward through the suburb of  Cheektowaga  and the East Side before turning southward and concluding downtown at Oak Street. The Scajaquada Expressway (State Route 198) is a short highway that connects the Kensington Expressway with Interstate 190. The Scajaquada is a convenient route to the neighborhoods of Parkside and the Elmwood Village, the popular commercial strips of Hertel Avenue and Grant Street, as well as attractions like Delaware Park, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Buffalo History Museum, the Darwin D. Martin House, and the Burchfield Penney Art Center. The Buffalo Skyway (State Route 5) begins downtown at I-190, extending southward parallel to the shore of Lake Erie with access to Gallagher Beach, Tifft Nature Preserve, and other Outer Harbor attractions. After passing over the Union Ship Canal via the Father Baker Bridge, the divided highway ends, but Route 5 continues as a wide, busy six-lane surface road (variously known as the Hamburg Turnpike, Lake Shore Road, or simply Route 5) that passes through the suburban areas of Lackawanna and  Hamburg  and continuing southward along the lake shore.  Buffalos highway system was designed for a city twice its size (a reflection of the population loss the area has undergone between the 1950s and today); as a result of that, the city does not suffer nearly as much from traffic congestion as other U.S. cities. Rush hour, such as it is, occurs on weekdays roughly from 6:30AM to 9AM and from 4PM to 6:30PM. A good rule of thumb the locals know is that, even at the height of rush hour, it generally takes no more than 30 minutes to drive from downtown to the outer edge of suburbia.</field>

		<field name="content">Buffalos public transportation system is operated by the  Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority  (NFTA). They run a single-line light rail system (the Metro Rail) as well as an extensive bus network. The NFTA system is focused around three main nodes. From largest to smallest, these nodes are located in downtown Buffalo, at University Station (located at the outer end of the Metro Rail), and at the Portage Road Transit Center in Niagara Falls. Most of the buses whose routes begin and end downtown access the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center directly; many also service the Buffalo-Exchange Street Amtrak station.  The Metro Rail extends along Main Street from the University at Buffalos South Campus at the northeast corner of the city southward to Canalside in downtown Buffalo, a distance of 6.4 miles (10.3km). With nearly 25,000 riders per day, the Metro Rail boasts the third-highest number of passengers per mile (km) among light-rail systems in the United States. The northern portion of the system is below ground. As the subway enters the downtown core, at the Theater District, it emerges from the tunnel and runs at street level for the remainder of its length. Rides on the above-ground portion of the Metro Rail are free of charge. To ride in the underground portion of the system, it costs $4.00 for a round-trip ticket, or $2.00 for a one-way ticket. The Metro Rail is a popular mode of transportation for employees and residents who live along the line and north of the city to commute downtown, and also for attendees of downtown events who want to avoid paying high prices for parking.  The NFTA eliminated the zoned fare system in October 2010. Generally speaking, rides on a single bus or light rail vehicle now cost $2.00 regardless of length. The exception is the "Enhanced Express" service introduced by the NFTA in September 2012 and applied to Routes 60 — Niagara Falls Express, 64 — Lockport Express, and 204 — Airport-Downtown Express, as well as to selected runs of Routes 69 — Alden Express and 72 — Orchard Park Express. An additional 50¢ surcharge per trip applies on Enhanced Express buses.  There are no free transfers between buses. Passengers who will need to transfer from the bus to the Metro Rail, from the Metro Rail to a bus, or between bus lines should consider purchasing a day pass for $5.

		<field name="content">As in many cities, bicycling as an alternative method of transportation is growing more and more popular in Buffalo. However, in terms of the development of infrastructure such as dedicated bike lanes on city streets and bike parking areas, Buffalo lags behind many other "bikeable" cities such as Minneapolis,  Portland , and Boston. Despite this, scenic bike routes such as the Riverwalk, the Scajaquada Creekside Bike Path, and the Outer Harbor Bike Trail are immensely popular with locals, and under the aegis of the citys newly adopted "Complete Streets" program, dedicated bike lanes and other rights-of-way are being added to more and more of the citys streets.     GO Bike Buffalo  (formerly Green Options Buffalo) is the local organization that promotes and advocates for cycling and other sustainable transportation alternatives in Buffalo. The Community Bicycle Workshop they operate at 98 Colvin Ave. in North Buffalo offers used parts and complete refurbished bikes for sale, as well as special programs periodically throughout the year.  Launched for "beta testing" in late summer 2012 with its official debut to come in 2013,  Buffalo BikeShare  is a program borne of a partnership between GO Bike Buffalo, the University of Buffalo, and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. Much like Buffalo CarShare, Buffalo BikeShare will provide its members with access to bicycles with the revolutionary new GPS-enabled SoBi (Social Bicycles) system, the first large-scale implementation of this technology anywhere.   Buffalo City Hall is seen in this view down Court Street from Lafayette Square. Built in 1931 from a design by the local firm of Dietel Wade, it is widely considered one of the worlds finest examples of Art Deco architecture.</field>

		<field name="content">250px   Interstate 405 in Los Angeles  In addition to interstates and US highways, California has one of the most expansive state highway systems in the United States.  As with all trips in the United States, a car is usually the best way to get around and see all destinations.  However the trip from the top of California to the bottom can take well over ten hours. The coast route (State Route 1 and U.S. 101) is much slower and windier than Interstate 5, and GPS travel estimate times may be inaccurate - especially on Highway 1.    Most California drivers are courteous and careful (although speeding is rampant), and the safety and ease of driving in California is comparable to most First World industrialized countries.  Exceptions may be found in the most congested areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles, where road rage and reckless driving are commonplace.  California uses the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) lane marking system standard throughout the United States, in which dashed white lines divide lanes of through traffic and yellow divides opposing traffic (with single dashed indicating passing and double solid indicating no passing).  In many urban areas the lane markings are replaced by Botts dots for additional tactile feedback when crossing lanes.    The network of freeways in major population centers are often confusing and intimidating to those unfamiliar with the area so having a good map is very helpful.  Almost all exits from freeways are on the right.  At interchanges between freeways, in most cases, the flow of traffic continues through the left lanes with the transition to the other freeway being in the right lanes.    Note that at certain freeway interchanges, Caltrans (California Dept. of Transportation) is notorious for posting advance direction signs that do not correctly explain which lanes correspond to which ramps.  Additionally, Caltrans does not always post signs warning of upcoming lane drops or merges.    For example, where a freeway has three through lanes and the central lane splits into two lanes, thus resulting in two ramps with two lanes each, the advance signage may incorrectly imply that only the right lane will break off for the upcoming right-side ramp, thus causing visitors driving in the middle lane to merge unnecessarily into the right lane.  And the two lanes on the right-side ramp may suddenly merge into each other without any warning.    These issues frequently result in visitors making wild last-minute lane merges.  The 2009 national MUTCD is intended to remediate this problem (as seen in California and several other states) by mandating the use of detailed arrows on direction signs that clearly show which lanes split into new lanes at upcoming interchanges, but California has not yet implemented the new MUTCD standard.  Thus, one should approach major freeway interchanges in California with caution.    Mile-based exit numbering is currently in progress but is still very erratic in areas; an exit number may not be marked at all, may be marked on the last directional sign before the exit, or may be marked on the final "EXIT" sign itself where the exit ramp separates.  Most highways are freely accessible, although there are a handful of toll roads in Orange County, Riverside County, and San Diego.  All major bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area have toll plazas on traffic in only one direction.  All California toll plazas have cash lanes.  Cash toll lanes are usually manned by human toll collectors, but some of the Orange County toll roads use only vending machines in the cash lanes which accept bills and coins.   California toll plazas do not have "exact change" lanes where drivers may toss change in a basket.  All California toll plazas also have lanes for FasTrak electronic toll collection transponders which can be used throughout the state.  FasTrak is not compatible with any other states ETC system.  Going through a FasTrak-only lane without a transponder or an active FasTrak account will result in a very expensive ticket.    In major metropolitan areas, the access ramps to a freeway may have two lanes, one marked with a diamond and the other with a traffic signal.  The diamond lane (called the "carpool lane") is for vehicles with two or more persons and motorcycles.  Vehicles with a single person must use the lane with the traffic light.  During high-traffic times, the traffic light spaces out the vehicles attempting to merge onto the freeway.  Be sure to read the sign below the light as some ramps allow two or three vehicles per green.  A few interchanges between freeways are now using controlled access lights to lighten the gridlock at interchanges.  Some freeways have a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane located along the center divider.  This lane, also called the carpool lane, is marked by signage on the wall separating the two sides of the freeway, and in Southern California by a double-yellow line. In most cases, this lane is for two or more persons per vehicle.  Many carpool lanes are in effect during rush hour only, and a few selected areas, notably in the Bay Area, require three or more per vehicle so check the signage before entering a carpool lane.  Motorcycles may also use carpool lanes. Carpool lanes in Southern California are usually in effect 24 hours a day, and have limited access points marked by a dashed white line. This is the only point at which a vehicle may legally enter or exit a carpool lane, since you are not allowed to cross a double yellow line. Minimum fine for unlawful use of a carpool lane is $341.    All persons in a moving vehicle are required to wear a seatbelt and the driver and all passengers can be individually ticketed for failing to do so.  Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.  Cellphone users are required to use a hands-free headset if talking on the phone while driving, and texting by the driver is illegal.  Unless otherwise signed, right-turns are permitted at red lights following a full stop. If it is raining hard enough to require you to use your windshield wipers, California law requires that your headlights be turned on.  California does not have stationary photo radar cameras like in other countries, and mobile manned photo radar units are rare and still experimental.  However, most California police officers do carry radar guns and use them often, and on rural freeways, the California Highway Patrol occasionally flies aircraft overhead to spot speeders and help ground units home in on their positions.  Red light enforcement cameras are in use at many urban intersections, but are usually marked only by a single "PHOTO ENFORCED" sign before the intersection.  Even more confusing, all approaches to an intersection may be marked with "PHOTO ENFORCED" signs when only one or two actual movements across the intersection are really photo-enforced.  The cameras must obtain a clear view of the drivers face and license plate before a ticket may be issued.  Californias laws against driving under the influence of alcohol are very strict; the maximum permissible blood alcohol concentration is 0.08%.  All drivers are strongly encouraged to call 911 to report drunk drivers.</field>

Theres fairly frequent service between San Francisco and Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, and Sacramento and Los Angeles. Theres hourly "clocker" buses between Los Angeles and San Diego. The bus stations in San Francisco, Sacramento, and San Diego are all well-located, but in Los Angeles the station is over a mile east of the downtown core.

		<field name="content">Public transportation is provided by the  Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ("MBTA") , which  serves the entire Boston Metro area (including Cambridge.) The local subway system is called the "T" and can take you to most points of interest. The Ts Red Line   has Cambridge stations in Kendall Square, Central Square, Harvard Square, and Porter Square. The Green Line has one station in Cambridge: Lechmere.   Directions are often marked "inbound" and "outbound", with reference to downtown Boston, where all four lines converge at four stops: State (Blue and Orange), Park Street (Red and Green), Government Center (Blue and Green), and Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red).  The MBTA does not operate 24-hour service.  Service begins for the day after 5.30AM and ends before 12:15AM on week-days.  Week-end schedules are slightly different and do not open until 6.30AM on Sundays.  Transport still runs for a short time after this — stated times are "first train leaves the station" or "last train leaves the station" — and thus, to complete the route, will actually be in service for as much as an hour longer or an hour before, but it is imperative to find out when last service is scheduled to the stations you need, and allot time for early or late arrivals.  MBTA employees can offer information on scheduling, but are not always available at all stations.  Communication between stations is complex and while significant changes will be announced, often T employees themselves are not informed of delays or minor changes.  Bus stations that are not also subway stations are unstaffed.  As of July 2009, subway fare is $2 and includes transfers between all four subway lines (Red, Green, Orange and Blue) and bus fare varies between $1.50 and $5 and also includes transfers.  Fares are paid via a stored value ticket available in vending machines at subway stations.  Fare is discounted if using the freely available reusable plastic pass, which can be obtained at Harvard Square station, 7-11 convenience stores or Star supermarkets.    Information on fares, routes, delays and schedule changes is available at the MBTAs web site.    Parking at the Alewife station on the Red line is ample and costs $8 per 24 hour period.    MBTA Commuter Rail (color-coded purple) leaves from Porter Square, serving one of the twelve commuter rail lines. This should not be confused with Amtrak,   the US national rail service, which departs from South Station, Back Bay Station, and North Station, all of which are in Boston.</field>

		<field name="content">A taxi trip of a mile or less costs $5, excluding tip.  Most of the major tourist areas will be a $10 to $25 fare.  A trip to Logan Airport can cost up to $55, including tip, tolls and any waiting time.  Flat rates are set for trips to Logan Airport from each hotel in Cambridge, which include all but luggage handling and gratuity.  Taxis are abundant in Harvard Square and Central Square, with many being queued up waiting for fares.  The places that they will queue are designated as cab stands by street signs.  Taxis are less abundant in Porter Square and rare near Alewife and Lechmere.  It is possible to signal a taxi from the sidewalk by waving an arm or a hand — a taxi cruising for fares is watching the crowds for this — and have it stop for you; however, taxi drivers from towns and cities other than Cambridge are heavily penalised if they accept passengers flagging them down on the street.  This rule is not always rigorously followed, but taxi drivers from Boston, Brookline, Somerville and other towns will be wary of street pick-ups.  Taxis are regulated by the Cambridge Licence Commission, which sets fares and handles complaints.    The two primary taxi companies in Cambridge are:</field>

		<field name="content">Cambridge is perhaps the most bicycle-friendly city in the Greater Boston area and probably has the most people who use bikes to commute and just to get around.  While there are few bike routes, most major streets have bike lanes, and many minor streets do too.  Car drivers tend to be aware of bike riders and generally respect bike riders right of way.  All of these features make Cambridge the safest place to ride a bike in Greater Boston.  Lock your bike when you park it!  Bike thieves are skilled and quick.  Be sure to lock your front wheel in addition to your frame, and your back wheel too if it is a quick-release.</field>

The Island in the Sky is the most accessible district and the easiest to visit in a short period of time. All other destinations require some boating, hiking or four-wheel driving to see the areas attractions.  High-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles are often needed to access many of the parks back-country attractions. The Island in the Sky has steep exposed switchbacks, and rocky terrain with expansive views of Canyonlands. The Needles offers more of a back-country setting with fifty miles of rugged trails including the renowned Elephant Hill. High-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicle are required for all Maze back-country roads, which are considered very difficult under any condition.</field>

They accept credit cards which is really convenient. The drivers are really nice and wear uniforms. The cabs are hands down the nicest in the area as they are clean inside and even smell good. Also they do not make you ride with strangers which is nice as well.     Yellow Cab, 215 S. Illinois Avenue at Walnut Street. The cab stand is only a block or two from the bars and restaurants of Illinois Avenue and downtown, but you could wind up waiting there for a while if all of the cabs are out. Cabs tend to be dirty and poorly kept. Dont be surprised if you end up sharing the cab with strangers - unlike most urban taxi companies, Yellow Cab will take multiple passengers on a single trip.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving in Carbondale is pretty straight-forward, with only a couple of instances of one-way streets (Main St. West-bound, Walnut St. East-bound, Illinois Ave. North-bound, and University Ave. South-bound).  The biggest hassle for drivers is the difficulty of parking anywhere near the SIU campus when classes are in session.  Most spaces on campus require a special sticker which are available to older students or to staff or faculty.  A few spaces are reserved strictly for visitors, however the best advice is probably not to bother, since there are ample parking spaces a few blocks away in town, and the walk is generally quite pleasant.</field>

		<field name="content">There are bicycle lanes on many of the bigger streets throughout town, and the smaller streets are generally quiet enough that even the least experienced urban cyclist should feel completely safe.  The latter is especially true in the western (mostly faculty inhabited) parts of town.  If you feel like taking a longer ride there are ample opportunities around Carbondale, especially to the east and west.  Try riding Grand Avenue toward Crab-Orchard lake (take a little jog to the right at Giant City Road).  Illinois Highway 13 leading west from Carbondale to the neighboring city of  Murphysboro  is surprisingly bicycle friendly: the shoulder is paved and the width of a full traffic lane. The whole trip center-to-center is about 7 miles, but with the growth of the incorporated parts of the two towns its only about 1½ miles between the two city limits.</field>

Carson Street, which is also US 395 business, runs north-south through the city. It is supplemented by Stewart Street, Roop Street, and Saliman Rd providing north-south connectivity through Carson City.  Williams Street is also US-50 as it heads east through Carson City.  Highway 50 (as it is mostly referred to locally) is joined by 5th Street to the south and College Parkway on the north carrying traffic eastward and westward to and from Carson Street.  The west side of Carson Street is actually known as Carson Citys "West Side" and is served mainly by small neighborhood streets.</field>

		<field name="content">Deep Notch  The northern segment of New York State Route 42 goes through the dramatic Deep Notch between Halcott and Sherrill mountains, both major peaks of the range, shortly after leaving Route 28 at Big Indian. It then descends past West Kill, following the creek of that name to Schoharie Creek at Lexington, where it connects to Route 23A.  New York State Route 213 is a roundabout back road from Kingston to Ashokan Reservoir. If youve got more time than you need get between them along Route 28, consider following Route 213 down Rondout Creek, past the bed of the old Delaware and Hudson Canal, through the picturesque hamlets of Rosendale, High Falls and Stone Ridge. From there Route 213 plunges through dense woods to drop you off just in front of the reservoirs main spillway, now closed to cars but not pedestrians.  Probably the most-used Catskills interior route, New York State Route 214 follows Stony Clove Creek up from Route 28 at Phoenicia through Stony Clove Notch, the pass between Plateau and Hunter mountains pictured at the top of this page. North of there it connects to Route 23A between Hunter and Tannersville.  Just west of Hunter, New York State Route 296 climbs north from 23A, offering some beautiful views of Hunter and Rusk mountains in the rear view mirror. It continues to Route 23 at Hensonville.</field>

		<field name="content">As with most large mountainous regions, there have been efforts to link hiking trails into a long-distance network. So far, there have been two that allow long-distance multi-day hikes in the Catskills:  The 558-mile (897 km) Finger Lakes Trail (FLT) begins its trip to that region at a trail junction in the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area, near the headwaters of the Neversink River. From there it heads west, following white blazes past the Balsam Lake Mountain firetower and Pepacton Reservoir, through Sullivan and Delaware counties. The FLT begins at a junction that is part of the Long Path, a 347-mile (560 km) trail from the George Washington Bridge to (currently) the  Schenectady  area. Most of the trail in the Catskills has been taken off the road; the one section where a road walk is still required passes close by the hamlet of Phoenicia. Highlights include Slide Mountain, much of the challenging Devils Path range, and the North-South Lake area. Generally it follows existing trails on state land; when on roads or private property it follows the same aqua blazes as the rest of its route.</field>

		<field name="content">Although it is primarily a tourist heritage line, the  Catskill Mountain Railroad , serves some short-range transportation needs along the Route 28 corridor, most notably for tubers on the stretch of Esopus Creek below Phoenicia. It has recovered from severe damage inflicted by Hurricane Irene; there have been plans to connect its Kingston segment with that one using the old Ulster and Delaware tracks although those have faced strong local opposition from proponents of a rail trail.</field>

		<field name="content">Champaign-Urbana has a significant number of bicyclists who cycle for transportation and recreation. The flat geography of the community makes it easy to get around on bicycle. While there are few on-street bike lanes or marked bicycle routes and the University of Illinois campus bike path system is considered by some to be obsolete and a bit chaotic, traffic on non-arterial streets is usually light and conducive to bicycling.  The Bike Project Coop    in downtown Urbana provides a shop for do-it-yourself bicycle repairs and also recycles and sells bikes at low prices. Two other bicycling organizations are the the Prairie Cycle Club    and Champaign County Bikes.org   .  The only known source of rental bicycles in Champaign-Urbana is the University of Illinois Division of Campus Recreation    which rents bicycles (including tandems) to students as well as to the general public starting at $15/day for students and members to $20/day for others.  The Champaign-Urbana Bicycle Map   , published in 2008, shows recommended routes for bicycle travel in the community. It can be obtained at no cost at many locations in Champaign-Urbana   .  The Champaign County Regional Planning Commission    publishes maps of Greenways and Trails    that includes bicycle paths in Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas in  Champaign County .  Every Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District bus is equipped with a bike rack that will carry two bikes on the front of the bus (see instructions for use   ). Additionally folding bikes may be carried on buses as per the transit district policy.</field>

		<field name="content">Champaign-Urbana has an award winning municipal bus system, the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District   . The adult fare is $1.00. Students, faculty, and staff of the University of Illinois need only show their university ID card to ride. Routes that serve campus with 10 to 15 minute frequency are the 1 Yellow, 5 Green, 10 Gold, 12 Teal, 13 Silver, and 22 Illini. Most community routes will drive through campus, but with limited frequency. iStops are designated stops for boarding and alighting that do not require passengers to pay a fare or show their ID card. These iStops are positioned along high density corridors found mostly in Campustown. Designated Stops require riders to show ID or pay a fare, but also designate where passengers may board and alight   .      The Yellow, Green, Teal, Silver, and Illini run past 3 am during the academic year. SafeRides is a late-night pick-up service provided to and funded by University of Illinois students. Vans are dispatched through the night to safely transport small numbers of students (1-3) within the designated community zone until 6:30 am   .   Routes that serve the community are the 2 Red, 3 Lavender, 4 Blue, 6 Orange, 7 Grey, 8 Bronze, 9A and 9B Brown, 11 Ruby, 14 Navy, and 27 Air Bus. On evenings and weekends, the decennial series of the routes operate (ie 20, 30, 50, 60, 70, 100, 110, 120, 130, 220, 270) along with the 180 Lime    which serves southwest Champaign and the 190 Plum    which serves Parkland College on Saturdays. Community routes operate on 15 to 40 minute frequency, but vary by time of day. The 27 Air Bus runs every hour due to the length of its trip   .  MTDs Hoppers run along the heaviest traveled portion of a route and operate at either 10 or 15-minute frequencies. This gives passengers the freedom to travel without a schedule. Hoppers connect downtown Champaign, downtown Urbana, and the University of Illinois. There are four Hopper routes: GOLDhopper, GREENhopper, ORANGEhopper, and YELLOWhopper. The GREENhopper is the only one of the four that only operates when the University is in session   .   The 280 tranSPORT operates before and after all home mens football games. The Urbana tranSPORT serves the Parking Deck on University Goodwin, Ceramics Building on Springfield Goodwin, Krannert (east side) and Campbell Alumni Center (west side) on Gregory Street, Gregory Goodwin, and ends at Memorial Stadium. The Champaign tranSPORT serves the Hill Street Parking Deck in downtown Champaign (north side), Green Wright, and ends near the intersection of Peabody Fourth.   In addition to providing service to Champaign and Urbana, the bus also serves the village of Savoy. The 334 West Direct operates within a designated area that is not served by fixed routes. It provides a connection from the outlying areas west of I-57 to fixed route service   .  MTDs 102 bus fleet is composed primarily of 40 foot transit buses   . The fleet is supplemented by 16, 60 foot articulated buses that operate primarily on campus. MTD also operates 7, 30 foot buses. All buses are low-floor and equipped with ramps, wheelchair tiedowns, and lift-up seats in the handicapped-priority seating area - ideal for wheelchairs, walkers, canes, and service animals. The front of every bus is also equipped with a bicycle rack that can hold two bikes. (see instructions for use)   Additionally folding bikes may be carried on buses as per the Districts policy. All buses had GPS locators installed a decade ago and have "Stop Annunciators" to meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements for blind travelers. Transit vans are used for SafeRides, Direct Services, and for ADA Paratransit   .    CUMTD has used GPS for a decade and uses it to track buses with a suite of STOPwatch services to provide real time information to passengers. STOPwatch.WEB provides arrival times for every bus stop in the District on cumtd.com. STOPwatch.WIDGET is a downloadable application that tracks buses on your desktop.  One of the most passenger-friendly utilization is STOPwatch@theStop, which provides real time "Next Bus Arrives..." signage at certain high-traffic bus stops throughout Champaign, Urbana, and the UI campus. Other STOPwatch services include STOPwatch.MOBI for smartphones and STOPwatch.SMS for texting. Learn how to use these services on MTDs STOPwatch page   .  CUMTD released an Application Programming Interface (API) in 2011 for community developers to build apps   . Developers can submit apps to be displayed in MTDs App Garage   .  Free printed maps and schedules come in booklet form (about 160 pages) and include color maps, schedules, and general information. They are easily found on MTD buses, at Illinois Terminal, most UI buildings, dorms and apartments, and at many businesses throughout the cities   .</field>

		<field name="content">Most of Champaign-Urbana is easy driving. However, the campus area is complex. Many streets are one way, traffic lights are set to favor pedestrians, parking is limited, and some streets are restricted to buses, so its easy to get sucked into frustrating loops. Hassles can be minimized by avoiding the rectangle inside Green Street, Fourth Street, Florida/Kirby Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue.  In general, there is little congestion to speak of. The exceptions:  Brief rush hours on weekdays  Prospect Avenue in Champaign, north of I-74  Home football games  Parent-student weekends  Move-in-day at the dormitories, in late August  As of the Summer of 2009, there are Zipcars available in Downtown Champaign.</field>

		<field name="content">Routes go through Chapel Hill, Carrboro and the UNC campus. Buses run on weekdays, with limited service on Saturdays and virtually no service on Sundays save for a single route circulating around the UNC campus. Service tends to be less reliable at night, on weekends and times when there is a football or men’s basketball game.

Commuting by bike is popular in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area. The Carrboro area is somewhat bike-friendly, while Chapel Hill is spotted by steep hills and poorly lit stretches of road. Some roads have bike lanes or wide shoulders, and there are also several bike-only paths; however, these tend to be short and do not tend to serve as transportation routes, but rather as exercise areas.</field>

		<field name="name">by public transportation</field>
		<field name="content">The public transportation system in Charleston consists primarily of a fleet of buses run by the Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA  ) and privately run taxi services. The bus system is not widely used by the upper-class residents of the city, and would be rated as fair by the standards of most larger urban areas.  Bus Route 11 serves the Charleston International Airport and the downtown area.  CARTA also operates four Downtown Area SHuttles (DASH 210, 211, 212, 213), which are useful for the visitor who does not wish to walk the historic downtown. Regular fares are $1.75, but downtown DASH services are free of charge.  Taxis are generally safe and inexpensive in Charleston but are sometimes difficult to find unless they are prearranged by calling one of the taxi services in advance or you are in the downtown area, where it is easy to flag one down.</field>

		<field name="content">Gray Line of Charleston   offers a choice of guided mini-bus tours of the historic, charming city of Charleston, designed to give you a fun and informative look into the city’s well-preserved past.  The best way to tour the city is by carriage drawn by horses or mules (many vendors available at the Market in downtown Charleston), although one might prepare oneself for some derisive comment and exasperation from locals inconvenienced by such quaint methods of transit.</field>

		<field name="content">Luckily for visitors to Charlestons peninsula, the historic district is accessible on foot. If staying in one of the many hotels on the peninsula, a visitor could easily explore most of the citys major historical sites without the benefit of a car, either by foot or with the help of the four DASH trolley lines.  Unfortunately, the plantations--a significant part of Charlestons history--are not located within walking distance of the peninsula.  If you are driving into the historic downtown, the first thing to do is to find someplace to park.  Garage parking is available at the Visitor Center for $1/hr, but metered street parking is also available throughout the city.  The streets in historic downtown Charleston are more or less parallel and perpendicular to the Cooper River waterfront, forming a warp grid pattern, with a major shift in the angle of the grid at the east-west "fault line" of Beaufain/Hasell Street, just north of the old Market Area near the waterfront.  The major east-west street, Calhoun Street, was once known as the Boundary Street, separating the then-suburbs north of it from the urban area south of it.  The major north-south street, King Street, is the main shopping street in downtown, from the Upper King area north of Calhoun around the Visitor Center south to the upscale  anchor, Charleston Place, at Beaufain/Hasell.  Several blocks south is a major east-west street, Broad Street, which divides two areas in historic downtown, aptly named North of Broad and South of Broad.  Those South of Broad were nicknamed SOBs, and those Slightly North of Broad were SNOBs. The French Quarter, founded by the French Huguenots, is just south of the Market Area along the waterfront.  The area near the southern tip of the peninsula, where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers meet, is known as The Battery.   There are many walking tours, which give you the opportunity to see more than just driving past in a bus or carriage.  There is a walking tour for virtually every interest.  You will find Pub Tours, Civil War tours, culinary tours, ghost tours, Gulla tours, architecture tours, art tours, and even pirate tours.  Some of the walking tour companies offer tours with guides in period costume. Charleston Pirate Tours even has a costumed guide whose parrot, a blue and gold macaw, accompanies the tour.</field>

However, only a few other districts (such as NoDa and Dilworth) are truly pedestrian-friendly. Outer districts, such as Ballantyne and University City, are pedestrian-unfriendly areas. If you must walk, give some thought to the weather; summer days in the South are quite hot and it is easy to get dehydrated.</field>

		<field name="content">Uptown is laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west with few exceptions. Streets running north-south have proper names. Charlottes outer suburbs are often difficult to navigate. Most roads are built according to the natural lay of the land; once you leave the I-277 loop, you are likely to find it increasingly difficult to predict the direction (and often, the name) of the road you are traveling on. Therefore, it is a good idea to make certain your directions are specific and trustworthy before venturing into an unknown area. Otherwise, you will likely find yourself relying on the (usually) friendly natives for directions back to your starting point.  Note that while I-277 has been completed for some time, I-485 is incomplete and still under construction. The northwestern quadrant of I-485 is still missing, but the rest of the freeway is quite useful for circling the perimeter of the city.   Similarly, I-277 is very useful when moving quickly around the center city. However, it is important to understand that one side of the "loop" is actually I-77, which interchanges with I-277 in two places. It is easy to misread the signs and end up moving farther along I-77 rather than circling back onto I-277. When using the loop, be sure to follow signs for "Downtown" in order to stay on the correct path.   Secondary roads in Charlotte are notoriously difficult to navigate. In particular, visitors and residents alike are often befuddled by frequent name changes in the roads. To make matters worse, many roads in the city share similar names. Also, very few of the citys roads are based on a grid or similarly organized system; most of the roads outside the city core are winding avenues that follow the natural features of the land.   The city can be a delight to explore by car, but visitors are strongly advised to pick up a free map or purchase a road map upon arrival. A GPS unit with the most current updates can, of course, make travel in and around Charlotte immensely more enjoyable.</field>

		<field name="content">Available to any part of Charlotte. There are several prominent companies, and unlike larger cities (for instance,  New York City  or  London ) the design of the vehicles is not uniform. However, a taxi is always recognizable by a sign on the roof of the car. If the taxi is vacant, the sign will be lit up; if it has a passenger, the sign will be off. It is customary to give a tip to cab drivers, especially if they help you with luggage or other items. It is usually a good idea to inquire about the fare before boarding if you are planning to make a longer trip; Charlottes sprawled-out nature can lead to high fares for trips outside the center city.  Cab fares in Charlotte are regulated by the city, and are consistent for all companies. The "drop charge" (pickup rate) is $2.50, and each 1/5th mile is $0.50. During weekday rush hours (7-9AM and 4-6PM), you will also be charged $0.50 for every minute spent in stopped traffic. For a direct one-way trip to or from the airport, the rate is a flat $25. You can save money by sharing a cab with a companion, but be aware that there is a $2 charge for each person after 2.</field>

Though they are generally clean and safe, they are usually not the most efficient way to get around the city. Bus fare is $2 one-way, $6 for a day pass. Allow 45 minutes for a one-leg trip, 2 hours for a two-leg trip. Bus transfers can be used on the LYNX light rail and are valid for an hour and 45 minutes after issue.

		<field name="content">Relative to most large cities, Charlottes central district is fairly auto-friendly.  Unless there is a major event, you should have no problem making your way around the district in a car (provided you have the patience to wait at frequent stoplights). However, be aware that "cruising" (circling the district repeatedly) is against the law and is being targeted by local police in an effort to reduce other criminal activity, especially at night.   Uptown is laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west with few exceptions. Streets running north-south have proper names.  From any direction, it is fairly easy to know where you are relative to the central intersection of Trade Tryon St. If you are using a paper map, you might note that the street grid is technically aligned at a 45-degree angle relative to the compass; "North" streets technically go northeast.   Taxis are fairly common in Uptown, and you can usually hail one from the curb. See "taxis" in the main  Charlotte  article for more information.</field>

		<field name="content">The  Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS)  operates buses throughout the city, including Uptown. The central bus terminal is located across Trade Street from the Bobcats Arena.  Bus fare is $2 with a transfer, or $6 for a day pass.  If you have not checked the departure time in advance, allow at least 30 minutes wait for your route to arrive.   In addition, there is the  LYNX Blue Line  light rail service, which connects Uptown to the South End and neighborhoods further southwest. In Uptown, LYNX uses the same route and most of the same stations as the Charlotte Trolley line. Frequency varies from 7-10 minutes on weekdays to 20-30 minutes on weekends. Fares for LYNX are $2 one-way (seniors and youth receive a discount), $4 for a round trip and $6 for a day pass.</field>

The Central Grounds area is very walkable, but some areas of campus (called "Grounds" by students) can be over a mile away. From the University to the downtown mall is a walk of 20-30 minutes and there is a free trolley bus that runs in a loop from the University to the Downtown Mall approximately every 20 minutes. It is not easy to find parking around the University area, including the Corner and between 14th Street and Rugby Road. There is a parking garage at the University Bookstore, on Emmet Street, that only fills up during certain University events (e.g., Days on the Lawn).</field>

Schedules can be found online at www.septa.com or aboard the bus itself. When boarding the bus be aware, doors close automatically before the bus starts moving. Hold on!

		<field name="name">cta</field>
		<field name="content">The  Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)  operates trains and buses in the city of Chicago and some of the suburbs. Put simply, the CTA is Chicago. It is a marvel and a beast, convenient, frustrating, and irreplaceable. Even if you have the option of driving while youre in town, no experience of Chicago is complete without a trip on the CTA.  Train rides of any length, from one side of the city to another or just one stop, cost $2.25 (save for rides originating at the OHare Blue Line station, which cost $5). At certain stations, you can transfer to other train lines at no extra cost. Once you have exited the turnstiles, entering another CTA station or boarding a CTA bus costs $0.25, and doing it a third time is free, provided it is still within two hours of when you started the trip.  Train fares must be paid with Ventra Tickets, which can be purchased and re-filled at kiosks in the lobby of every CTA train station. Purchasing a ticket costs $3, which includes a one-time $0.50 fee. (Reloading the ticket for future trips can be done for any amount and will not require the $0.50 fee.) All kiosks accept cash and credit cards. Many locals use the  Ventra Card , which cannot be purchased at stations, but can be ordered online (with a $5 fee that is convertible to transit fare upon registration of the card) and purchased at  select retail locations . One version of the Ventra Card includes a fee-heavy, much-criticized prepaid debit account, so take note which one you are ordering.  Visitor Passes are sold for unlimited travel on the CTA: 1 day (24 hours) for $10; 3 days for $20; 7 days for $28 and 30 days for $100. One, three, and seven-day passes are on sale at certain train stations (notably, the OHare Blue Line station), currency exchanges and some convenience stores, and  online . Tickets for single rides or larger increments can also be purchased on-line. Tickets, cards, 30-day passes, and a special 7-day CTA/Pace pass ($33) can also be used on the suburban Pace bus system.  None of these instruments can be used on the suburban Metra or South Shore train systems.  The CTA officially refers to its entire train system as  The L . The CTA inherited the name from its predecessor agencies that ran elevated trains, but now refers to all trains, including subways, as The L. All train lines radiate from the  Loop  to every corner of the city. The "Loop" name originally referred to a surface-level streetcar loop, which pre-dated the elevated tracks. That any form of transportation preceded the present one may come as a surprise, given how old some of the stations look, but they work.  A CTA bus - note the number/destination and symbol for wheelchair accessibility  CTA train lines are divided by colors: Red, Green, Brown, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange and Pink. All lines lead to the Loop except the Yellow Line, which provides service between the suburb of  Skokie  and the northern border of Chicago. The Red and Blue lines run 24/7, every day of the year, making Chicago and New York City the two American cities, and one of a handful worldwide, to offer 24-hour rail service within the city. Hours for the other lines vary somewhat by the day, but as a general rule run from about 4:30AM–1:00AM. A few major stations have trackers noting the times when the next trains will arrive, but most do not.  Before you travel, find out the name of the train stop closest to your destination, and the color of the train line on which it is located. Once youre on board, youll usually find route maps in each train car, above the door (although they are often stolen). The same map is also available  online . The name signs on platforms often have the stations location in the street grid, e.g. "5900 N, 1200 W" for Thorndale.  There should be an attendant on duty at every train station. They cannot provide change or deal with money, but they can help you figure out where you need to go and guide you through using the machines.  A CTA bus stop: note the symbols for wheelchair accessibility and late-night hours.  Buses run on nearly every major street in the city, and in many cases, every four blocks apart. Look for the blue and white sign, which should give a map of the route taken by the bus and major streets/stops along the way. Once inside, watch the front of the bus, a red LED display will list the names of upcoming streets where stops are located, making it easy to stop exactly where you want, even a small side street. To request a stop, pull the cord hanging above the window and make sure you hear an audible ding. Hollering at the bus driver will raise tempers but works in a pinch.  Bus rides of any length cost $2 with a Ventra Ticket or Card or $2.25 in cash. Major bus routes run 7–15 minutes apart during daylight hours, depending on the route. Less-traveled routes or routes during off-peak hours may run less frequently. Check the sign to be sure the bus is still running. There are several bus routes that are  24/7; these are called OWL routes, and the signs usually have an owl to belabor that point. (See individual district articles for major bus routes through different parts of the city.)  If you have a web-enabled mobile device, the CTA runs a little godsend called the  CTA Bus Tracker , which uses GPS to provide reliable, real-time tracking information for almost all bus routes. Some bus shelters are equipped with real-time bus trackers of their own.  CTA buses accept Ventra Tickets but do not sell them. They also accept cash but do not provide change. You must pay exact change, or forfeit your change by paying a rate equal to the smallest denomination of money you have.  In compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, all CTA buses and some train stations are accessible to wheelchairs. Wheelchair-accessible L stations are indicated by the international wheelchair symbol and have elevators or are at ground level. If you are trying to get to a place with a non-accessible station, there will be alternate routes by bus so contact the CTA for more information.  Crime on the CTA is low, but as with any major urban area, travelers should be aware of their surroundings, especially when traveling in the wee hours of the night, and sit close to the driver if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. Buses are being equipped with video cameras as the fleet is upgraded. Some train cars have a button and speaker for emergency communication with the driver, located in the center aisle of the car on the wall next to the door. This is for emergencies only: do not press this just to chat, as the driver is required to halt the train until the situation has been confirmed as resolved, and your fellow passengers will not be amused.</field>

		<field name="content">Metra train on the way to the Loop   Metra system map   Metra , ☎ +1 312 322-6777, runs commuter trains for the suburbs, providing service within Illinois, to  Kenosha ,  Wisconsin , out west, and to the far south and southwest suburbs. Metra trains are fast, clean, and punctual, but unpleasantly crowded during rush hour.  Generally, every car or every other car on the train has a bathroom.  Metras Electric Line provides service to the  convention center  (McCormick Place),  Hyde Park  (Museum of Science and Industry, University of Chicago), and the  Far Southeast Side s Pullman Historic District and Rainbow Beach. The Electric Line is fast, taking at most 15 minutes to reach Hyde Park from the Loop. Unfortunately, service outside of rush hours is infrequent (about once/hour), so be sure to check the schedules while planning your trip.  The  Northern Indiana Commuter Transit District  (NICTD), ☎ +1 219 926-5744 operates the South Shore Line railroad.  The South Shore Line railroad runs commuter trains between the Millennium Park Metra station in downtown Chicago and the  South Bend ,  Indiana  airport.  South Shore trains cannot carry passengers whose journey is entirely within the State of Illinois, except to and from the Hegewisch station on Chicagos far southeast side.  Although the South Shore Line receives some subsidies from Metra, it is not part of the Metra system and does not accept Metra or CTA tickets.  Although there are plans to change this in the future, none of the commuter trains currently accept CTA fare cards as payment.  From downtown Chicago, the  Metra fare  to McCormick Place is $2.75 and the fare to Hyde Park is $3. Buy your tickets before boarding the train at a window or one of the automated vending machines. You can buy a ticket on the train, but that comes with an extra $3/ticket surcharge if the station youre leaving from had an open ticket window or an operational ticket machine.  Ten-ride, weekly, and monthly passes are available. If you have a group of four or more people, it may be cheaper to purchase a ten-ride card and have all of your fares punched from that one card.  If using Metra on Saturday and/or Sunday, you can purchase an unlimited ride weekend pass for just $7. Keep in mind that Metra only accepts cash at this time.</field>

In addition to its regular fixed-route service, Pace provides two types of paratransit services within the areas served by Pace and the CTA.  ADA  Paratransit Service  is provided to passengers who have been previously  certified as disabled .  Call-n-Ride service is provided in some suburban areas where there is insufficient demand to justify regularly scheduled service.  Call-n-Ride passengers must call in advance to arrange pickup and drop-off.  The standard  Pace bus fare  is $1.75.  This may be paid in cash (no change provided) or by using a CTA Transit Card, CTA Chicago Card, CTA 30-day pass, or a 7-day CTA/Pace pass.  Pace accepts transfers from the CTA by passengers using a Transit Card or Chicago Card for the same fee as the CTA charges (25 cents for the second ride and free for the third ride within two hours).  Conversely, passengers paying with a Transit Card or Chicago Card receive transfer privileges onto CTA buses and trains under the same terms.</field>

		<field name="content">Avoid driving in downtown Chicago if at all possible. Traffic is awful, pedestrians are constantly wandering into the street out of turn, and garages in the Loop can cost as much as $40 per day. And although downtown streets are laid out on the grid, many have multiple levels which confuse even the most hardened city driver. Even outside of the city center, street parking may not be readily available. If you do find a spot, check street signs to make sure that a) no residential permit is required to park here and b) parking is not disallowed during certain hours for "street cleaning", rush hour or something along those lines. Parking restrictions are swiftly and mercilessly enforced in the form of tickets and towing — be especially wary during snowy weather.  Parking is handled by one-per-block kiosks, which will issue a slip for you to put in your front window. The kiosks will accept cash or credit cards. If the kiosk fails for any reason (such as the printer running out of paper), there should be a phone number to call to report it and ensure you dont receive an undeserved ticket. As you do, any passing Chicagoan will be happy to commiserate about how badly the city bungled privatizing the parking meters.  Be advised: talking on a handheld cell phone while driving is illegal in Chicago, and the police are eager to write tickets for it. If you need to take a call, use a hands-free headset — or better yet, pull over.  The perpetual construction is bad enough, but drivers on the city expressways can be very aggressive.  For those used to driving on expressways in the Northeast, this may be a welcome reminder of home.  For everyone else, though, it can be intimidating.</field>

Fares are standard and the initial charge ("flag pull") is $2.25 for the first 1/9 mile, then $0.20 for each additional 1/9 mile or $0.20 for each elapsed 36 seconds. There is a $1.00 fuel surcharge added to the initial charge. There is also a flat $1.00 charge for the second passenger, and then a $0.50 charge for each additional passenger after that (for example, if four people take a taxi together, there will be $2.00 in additional flat fees). There is no additional charge for baggage or credit card use. Rides from  OHare  and  Midway  to outer suburbs cost an additional one half the metered fee. Give the driver the nearest major intersection to which you are heading (if you know it) and then the specific address.  Outside of the downtown, North Side, Near West and Near South neighborhoods, you will likely have greater difficulty hailing a taxi directly from the street. In these situations, you can call for a taxi to come pick you up. Taxis typically take 10–15 minutes from the time you call to arrive. The principal companies are:           The above applies only to Chicago taxis. Suburban taxi cabs have their own fares and rates, depending on the laws and regulations of the town in which they are based.</field>

		<field name="content">Chicago has a bike path along the shores of Lake Michigan, making north-south travel very convenient as long as the weather is favorable by the lake. Most major city streets have bike lanes, and the  biking  culture is established enough that cars tend to accommodate and (grudgingly) yield to bicycles. Bike trips can also be combined with rides on the CTA, and Chicagos new bike-sharing program DIVVY has docks located near many major stations. See the  bicycling section  below for more details.</field>

		<field name="content">In the summer, water taxis are sometimes more convenient than the CTA, if you are traveling around the fringes of downtown. They are also a relatively cheap way to take in some offshore views. Two private companies operate water taxi services around the Loop.   Chicago Water Taxi  (Wendella Boats) ☎ +1 312 337-1446, uses yellow boats and has three stops (Michigan Ave, LaSalle/Clark, Madison St), plus Chinatown on weekends ($2, $4 Chinatown/all day pass). Taxis run roughly M-F 6:30AM–6:30PM, Sat-Sun 10:30AM–6:30PM.   Shoreline Sightseeing  ☎ +1 312 222-9328, has blue and white boats. It is more expensive ($5–7), but it serves seven destinations including some on Lake Michigan (Union Station/Sears Tower, Wells Wacker, Michigan Ave Bridge, Navy Pier-Ogden Slip, Navy Pier-Dock St, Buckingham Fountain, and Museum Campus). Shoreline taxis run 10AM-6PM every twenty minutes and 6PM-9PM every half hour Memorial Day–Labor Day, with occasional and less frequent service in the spring and fall.</field>

Route 1 Is a route marketed to tourists as the 1 for Fun, and although it only runs about every 30 mins on weekdays and every hour on weekends, its still useful for getting to some major sites between Union Terminal and Mt Adams just make sure to get a schedule on Metros website before trying to catch it: Museum Center,Ezzard Charles and Linn Street (Near Music Hall and Washington Park), Government square area F(eastbound)/4 Walnut Downtown (westbound), Art Museum (Mt. Adams), Park and Taft Ave.  Route 72 Stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street Court Street (Downtown),  Government Square, Area B,  Kenwood Road Montgomery Road,   Mason-Montgomery Fields Ertel Road ("Park and Ride"), Mason-Montgomery Western Row Road, Kings Island. Route 71X Stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street Court Street (Downtown),  Government Square, Area B,  Kings Island,  Mason-Montgomery Fields Ertel Road ("Park and Ride"). Route 17 One of the more frequent routes in Metro, good for going to OTR, University of Cincinnati, Clifton and Northside. The ride up from Main Street in OTR to the hilltop neighborhoods on E Clifton is a good way to soak in the gorgeous Victorian architecture of the area and see a few of the more vibrant urban neighborhoods too. MetroPlus Metros try at speeding up bus times by reducing stops.  This limited route goes between Downtown and Kenwood Mall passing by University of Cincinnati (not far from the Zoo) and Xavier University along the way.  Runs every 15-30 mins, weekdays ONLY see website schedule for details.</field>

		<field name="name">by bus</field>
		<field name="content">Cincinnati lacks light rail or a working subway system, so the main form of public transportation is by bus. The region is served by two different bus systems. The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (Sorta)    operates Metro, the bus company that serves the Ohio side of the state line.  The Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (Tank) serves Northern Kentucky and all routes between Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Bus lines marked with a "X" are express routes and make less frequent stops. Be sure to check whether the bus makes a stop at your required destination before you get on. Sorta and Tank operate a different fare rate system, though both require passengers to submit the exact fare and no change is given.  If you plan on taking the bus, highly recommended is the "Cincinnati Frequent Transit Map" which was developed by a concerned citizen looking to increase transit use. This will give you a good idea of which parts of town are well served by transit as well as which parts of town are underserved, eliminating lines from the official map that dont have frequent service.  More information here: http://cincymap.org/  For sightseeing the recommended option is the Metro 1 bus. Metros tag line for this bus is "Ride the One for Fun," because it visits the most important cultural destinations in the city. The bus loops from the Union Terminal Museum Center, to downtowns theaters and museums, to the sports stadiums and parks on the riverfront, to the upscale Mount Adams residential neighborhood, to Eden Park and Krohn Conservatory, ultimately ending in nearby Peebles Corner, Walnut Hills. This bus is $1.75 a ride, but passes are available.  If taking the 1 especially if from a more transit rich city, make sure to check a schedule first as the line can close early and doesnt have the highest frequencies of routes.  If you wish to cross the river into Kentucky be sure to ride the Southbank Shuttle, which loops around the riverfront on the Ohio and Kentucky sides. Stops include Fountain Square, The Banks, Newport on the Levee, and Roebling Point. The Shuttle is often used by locals who do not want to drink and drive or pay high parking prices, as the shuttle stops at many popular nightlife spots. The Shuttle is instantly recognizable by its old-fashioned trolley look, but are newer and cleaner than the regular TANK bus system. The shuttle is also cheaper at $1 a ride. Daily passes are available.  Metro charges passengers based on zones: Zone 1 (The City of Cincinnati), Zone 2 (Hamilton County, outside of Cincinnati), and Zone 3 (Stops outside of Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati).  Prices for each zone are respectively: $1.75, $2.65, and $3.  Metro has several routes, most notably routes 71X and 72 (Both $4.25), which charge a slightly higher fare than normal.  Transferring between one bus route to another on the Metro system requires another 50 cents for a transfer ticket and passengers transferring from a Zone 2 or 3 bus to another Zone 2 or 3 bus should ensure that the bus driver hole punches the appropriate zone on the transfer ticket. Otherwise a further payment equivalent to the difference between the zone youre traveling to, if your trip ends in zone 2 or 3, and zone 1 fare must be paid.  TANK (Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky) buses charge a flat rate of $1.50 for all adults, 75¢ for seniors, $1; for students. Transfers between Tank buses are free. However, transferring between Tank buses and a Metro buses costs an additional 50¢ or 40¢, if youre transferring to a TANK bus from a Metro bus.</field>

		<field name="content">While in the past there were some odd regulations making riding taxis without calling ahead of time a chore, this has changed.    People now can hail taxis from anywhere and unlike heavy taxi oriented-cities like Chicago some cabs have lights (newly installed) indicating if someone is in the cab or not.  Taxis are pretty easy to come by downtown and in OTR, but are much harder outside of these key neighborhoods.  Taxi costs are all over the place as rates arent set by the city or the state, if you pick the wrong company, you could pay 50% more than another company!  Inquire with the taxi companies regarding rates, see below for contact information.

These steps were built before people had cars to facilitate easy transportation by foot up and down the steep hillsides that populate the city.  Some steps are very famous such as the Mt. Adams Steps up to the Holy Cross Immaculata Church (described under the To See section) while others underused and/or are falling apart. Still more, like St. Gregorys steps in Mt. Adams, are hidden gems, guiding a traveler through a hidden forest oasis in a densely populated neighborhood. Be cautious when traveling on these steps, as they sometimes go through remote areas and while the neighborhood on one end of the steps could be safe, the neighborhood at the other could be crime infested.  The city has a somewhat difficult to decipher but extensive guide of the locations and conditions of the steps here   .  An even better guide to the citys steps is here   .</field>

		<field name="content">Some of the lovely historic architecture one could miss unless walking!  Some of the older neighborhoods in Cincinnati are quite walkable, with the Clifton Gaslight District (Ludlow), Over-The-Rhine, Mt. Adams, and Downtown being amongst the easiest to travel by foot.  Due to massive depopulation of what were formerly neighborhoods with densities approaching that of New York City, (like Over-The-Rhine and the West End), Cincinnati is way more car oriented these days with most destinations being too spread out to walk to.  However, many of these districts were built to pedestrian scale and are worth a stroll so long as one exercises caution (see the stay safe section). A visitor from a larger East Coast city may expect neighborhoods of similar scale and architectural composition to be filled with people, but instead oftentimes they are full of abandonment and the problems that come along with it.  However, places like Mt. Adams, Downtown, or Clifton around the Gaslight District dont have these problems are well worth exploring by foot, park your car outside of the neighborhood and walk right in.</field>

		<field name="content">Cincinnati has a long way to go before it reaches the level of Portland or Chicago in terms of bicycle culture and accessibility. However, the city has lately been installing bicycle lanes and even on street bicycle parking in some key neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine and Northside.  Biking in Cincinnati is challenging, and is recommended for experienced urban riders, as the terrain is quite hilly producing often curvy roads that can go up or down very steep grades.  Despite the challenge, the narrow roads and urban setting are well suited for using a bicycle. Residential neighborhoods along the river near downtown (Roebling Point, The Banks, Over-the-Rhine, Newport Historic East Row) are relatively flat and quiet.  The city posts a color coded map/guide to recommended bicycle routes and facilities as well as information regarding its bicycle policies and projects here   . All buses have bike mounts on the front if you get tired or dont want to pedal up a hill.  You can rent bikes from the newly opened  Cincinnnati Bike Center  at Smale Riverfront Park or from  Wheel of Fun Rentals  by Sawyer Point on the Riverfront downtown (charges hourly, including tandem bikes).</field>

		<field name="content">For getting quickly and conveniently to most places in Cincinnati, you will need a car.  Be aware that there is a street grid only in Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods.  Outside of those parts of the city navigation can be tough, with street names changing constantly and unintuitive routes being the norm.  It can be particularly tough getting up to Mt. Adams. If you dont go down the right series of one-way streets, you could wind up getting flung out to one of the surrounding neighborhoods or Eden Park. There are a few signs directing drivers through the neighborhood, but they are easily missed.  A good roadmap or GPS system is highly recommended if you plan on driving around.  Many roads are very narrow and very hilly reflecting the age of most of Cincinnati, which was built well before the automobile was the mainstay of transportation.  Some streets will feel like country roads with the occasional urban house/apartment built where the terrain can support it.  Other roads like the aptly named Straight Street quite literally go straight down a hill at a very steep grade.  Be careful when driving in inclement weather and remember that when parking on a steep slope, point your tires towards the curb (if downhill) or away from the curb (if uphill) and use your emergency brake.  I-75 is to be avoided around rush hours at all costs. While traffic isnt as heavy as one would encounter in much larger cities, it can still be quite formidable. The large amount of truck traffic, combined short ramps and many blind corners create a traffic nightmare.  If you can, take the less traveled (though still somewhat congested) I-71.  Parking is generally cheap and plentiful in Cincinnati. The few trouble spots are around the University in the Clifton/Corryville areas (Uptown), Downtown, and Mt. Adams.  When parking in Mt. Adams, be aware of parking restrictions by reading the signs. There are far more parking restrictions here than anywhere else in the city, due to the narrow streets and dense population of that neighborhood.</field>

The most important north-south route in Clarence is Transit Road, or NY 78, which serves as Clarences western boundary with the Town of Amherst. Transit Road is the only place in town where large shopping malls and plazas, chain restaurants, and other large-scale suburban retail can be found.   Other major roads that run through Clarence include:  East-West Routes: From south to north: Wehrle Drive, Sheridan Drive (NY 324), Greiner Road, Roll Road, Clarence Center Road, County Road, Tonawanda Creek Road.  North-South Routes: From west to east: Harris Hill Road, Shimerville Road, Goodrich Road, Strickler Road, Salt Road.</field>

		<field name="content">Buffalo and its surrounding area, including Clarence, is served by the  NFTA Metro System , which comprises a network of buses and a light rail line. However, the affluence of the towns citizenry has meant that out of all Buffalos major suburbs, Clarence is the least well-served by public transit. In fact, only three bus routes enter the Clarence town line—and these three buses only serve Transit Road!    NFTA Metro Bus 48 — Williamsville  begins at the University Metro Rail station and runs along Main Street through Amherst and Williamsville. At Transit Road it turns northward, passing the Transitown Plaza and the Shops at Main Transit before ending at the Eastern Hills Mall. Bus 48 makes 20 trips on weekdays, eleven on Saturdays and ten on Sundays and legal holidays.   NFTA Metro Bus 49 — Millard Suburban  runs Monday through Friday eight times per day. Route 49 begins at the University Metro Rail station and runs through Amherst along Main Street, Bailey Avenue and Sheridan Drive. It then turns from Sheridan Drive onto Transit Road and continues northward, passing by the Eastern Hills Mall and the Eastgate Plaza, before turning westward at Maple Road back into Amherst and ending at Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital.   NFTA Metro Bus 66 — Williamsville Express  begins in downtown Buffalo, passing through Buffalo and Cheektowaga along the Kensington Expressway and I-90 without stopping. It exits the highway at Main Street in Williamsville and proceeds eastward to Transit Road, where it turns north, passing by the Transitown Plaza and the Shops at Main Transit and servicing the Eastern Hills Mall. "B" buses end at Eastern Hills, while "A" buses continue further north along Transit Road, passing by the Eastgate Plaza before ending their run at Millersport Highway at Clarences northern border. Three buses—one "A" trip and two "B" trips—depart daily Monday through Friday, but it should be noted that outbound trips (from Buffalo to Clarence) take place in the evening only, whereas inbound trips take place in the morning only.</field>

Several larger cities have come to Clemson to observe the system, which even carries many university students and well-to-do professors to class. Clemson Area Transit covers many major destinations, including most of the areas hotels/motels, and most major eateries. For the traveler on a budget, or even those not on a tight budget, the CAT bus system may be the way to go. It covers both the campus as well as surrounding cities, including Anderson, Central, Pendleton and Seneca. It should also be noted that travelers on the CAT bus going to Anderson can, upon transfer, obtain a fare-free day pass to the Electric City Transit system which serves the city of Anderson.</field>

		<field name="content">Cleveland might be one of the easiest cities in the world to navigate. There are almost no one-way streets, because the city was planned to have "European Avenues" (which resulted in the foresight to make them broad enough for vehicular transportation that couldnt have been imagined in the late 1700s). Traffic is generally not a problem relative to other major U.S. metro areas. Throughout the downtown area, purple signs direct visitors to let you know where you are and what district you are in. The streets that run north-south are numbered, except for Ontario Street (the north-south street bisecting Public Square). Numbered Streets are named as "West", west of Ontario and "East", east of Ontario. (Broadview Road becomes the primary geographic boundary between East and West addresses to the south of the city.) The major east-west streets are generally named as "Avenues".  Finding an address is simple as well.  Numbers on north-south streets increase as you head south from Lake Erie, numbers on east-west streets increase as you head away from downtown and coincide with the numbered streets (i.e. 6500 Detroit Ave is located at the corner of Detroit Ave and W 65th St).  Odd addresses on north-south streets are for buildings on the east side of the street, and even addresses are on the west side; on the west side of Cleveland, odd addresses on east-west streets are located on the south side of the street, while even addresses are on the north side—the reverse is true for east-west streets on the east side of Cleveland.  This addressing scheme continues into most of the suburbs (some exceptions include Berea and Bedford) and even most cities and townships in Lake and Lorain Counties.  Most of the city is laid out in grids and has very clear signage enabling you to easily know where you are.  Throughout the area, signs are thoroughly placed to indicate the route to the nearest major freeway, making the city extremely visitor-friendly!  Cleveland rush hours (7AM-9AM; 4PM-6:30PM in the afternoon) are light compared to many metropolitan areas, with traffic still moving near posted speed limits throughout most of the area.  Some places notorious for slow or stop and go traffic are:  Morning:  I-71 Northbound from W 25th St into Downtown and from Bagley Rd to I-480  I-77 Northbound from I-490 into Downtown and from the Ohio Turnpike to I-480  I-90 Eastbound from W 25th St into Downtown  I-90 Westbound from E 55th St into Downtown  I-271 Northbound approaching I-480  I-480 Eastbound from the Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176) to I-77 and approaching I-271  Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176) approaching I-90/490  Afternoon:  I-71 Southbound from I-480/Ohio 237 to Bagley Rd  I-77 Southbound from downtown to I-490 and from I-480 to Pleasant Valley Rd  I-90 Westbound from downtown to the Innerbelt Bridge  I-90 Eastbound from downtown to Dead Mans Curve  I-271 Southbound approaching I-480  I-480 Westbound from W 130th St to I-71/Ohio 237  Road construction can impact travel times at rush hours, and usually occurs only from March to November.  Any point in  Cuyahoga County  is normally reachable from any other point in the county by car in 45 minutes or less at non-peak driving hours.</field>

		<field name="content">Greater Cleveland is also served by a public bus and rail transit system, operated by the  Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority , also known as "RTA". The rail portion is officially called the Cleveland Rapid Transit, but is known by locals as "The Rapid". It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines (which extend to the east side suburbs), and a heavy rail line, the Red Line (which connects Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the west side suburbs with Tower City Center downtown and continues to University Circle and beyond). In the late 1990s, RTA added the Waterfont Line, a short track specifically catering to tourists by connecting Tower City Center to the Flats Entertainment District, Cleveland Browns Stadium, Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport. In 2008, RTA installed a bus rapid transit line, called the "Health Line", which runs along Euclid Avenue, providing a direct route between Clevelands primary tourist attractions from downtown to University Circle. A $5.00 All-Day Pass is good for unlimited rides on both the trains and the buses.</field>

		<field name="content">The main north-south artery of College Park is Route 1 (also known as Baltimore Avenue).  Many destinations of interest (including the university) are along this road.  An alternative, slightly to the east, is Rhode Island Avenue.  Major east-west roads include University Boulevard (Route 193) and Campus Drive/Paint Branch Parkway.  Route 1 traffic can be horrendous at times.  Avoid arriving or leaving College Park between 5 and 6 Monday through Thursday and between 4 and 5 on Friday.  It can take up to one hour to make it a few miles during these rush hour times.  There is no free parking in College Park, so be warned.  Make sure to check each meters restrictions and rules.</field>

		<field name="content">Columbus is a car-centric city, with usage of a car required outside of the areas directly surrounding downtown. Parking is extensive (and reasonably priced) at almost all major destinations. There are many surface lots and garages around the city. There are only a few areas of the city, like the Short North, where parking can be hard to come by; those locations all feature abundant valet parking at an affordable $5 per vehicle.  Keep in mind that U-turns are illegal citywide in Columbus.  Downtown is a short drive ($50 taxi fare) from Port Columbus (the airport) via I-670W.  Columbus is notorious for aggressive towing companies, especially downtown, on campus, and in the Short North. Before you park somewhere, make sure that it does not have a "Private Parking" or "Tow Away Zone" sign nearby.</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Most visitors and locals travel around Corpus Christi in cars.  Most likely, a rental or personal car is the best way for you to see the city.  The main routes one needs to know to get around efficiently in Corpus Christi are I-37, South Padre Island Drive (TX-358), the Crosstown Expressway (TX-286), and Ocean Drive/Shoreline Boulevard (Ocean Drive is an extension of Shoreline Blvd. for about seven miles along Corpus Christi Bay).    I-37 brings you into town from the west and ends on Shoreline Drive downtown on the Bayfront.  Shoreline Blvd. is a section of about four miles in downtown Corpus Christi along the bay. It begins in the area of the Art Museum of South Texas and leads south, becoming Ocean Drive.  Following Ocean Drive takes one through the most scenic part of the city and to its end at the Naval Air Station and Texas AM.   South Padre Island Drive does not go to South Padre Island (a frequent mistake made by visitors), but is better thought of as the southern section of Padre Island Drive.  It is a section of 358 running from I-37 down the southern side of the city from northwest to southeast and ending on Padre Island at Padre Island National Seashore. Along it is the main shopping and dining area for the city. Locals will invariably refer to South Padre Island Drive as S.P.I.D., with the letters always pronounced separately.  Visitors should remember that there will not be signs reading SPID.  Instead, many read NAS-CCAD (for Naval Air Station and Corpus Christi Army Depot) or TX-358.  Connecting the northern end of S.P.I.D. to the downtown area near where I-37 ends is the Crosstown Expressway.  The Harbor Bridge takes drivers over the ship channel from downtown to Corpus Christi Beach, a popular destination for tourists.</field>

		<field name="content">Destinations in Cranston are most easily accessible by car. Renting a car or bringing your own is advisable. Many locations of interest are situated close to each other and can be walking distance apart, but locations may be car-centrically designed or areas of high traffic volume. Travelling from western Cranston across the city into the Edgewood neighborhood can take quite awhile by Rhode Island standards. Park Avenue is a primary way to do this, and receives much traffic. Central and eastern Cranston resemble the capital city of Providence to a greater degree than western Cranston, so plan for traffic in these places accordingly.</field>

		<field name="content">Wayfinding sign  Davenport is generally an easy city to navigate.  The city streets are basically laid out in a grid pattern, even as the city climbs the bluff above the Mississippi River.  Some of the newer residential sections of the city do not follow a grid, however.  For the most part, east-west streets are numbered starting near the Mississippi River and progressing in order as one travels north.  There are several major east-west thoroughfares that are named and not numbered.  River Drive (US Route 67 from Western Avenue east to Bettendorf and US Business Route 61 from Brady Street west to I-280) is on the south side of the city near the river.  Locust Street travels through the middle of the city from I-280 to Bettendorf.  Further north is Central Park Ave, which is a four-lane street from Brady Street west to Emeis Park. Kimberly Road (US Route 6) travels from I-280 in the west to I-74 in the east before it turns south and enters Bettendorf.  The only major numbered street across the city is 53rd Street, which starts at about North Pine Street in the west and turns into 53rd Avenue when it enters Bettendorf.  Third Street, Fourth Street, Welcome Way, Harrison Street and most of Brady Street are one ways.  It is important to note that the Mississippi River generally travels through the Quad Cities from east to west before heading in its normal southerly direction. Thus, Rock Island, Illinois is to the south of Downtown Davenport and east of the west end.  Addresses on east-west streets are numbered from Brady Street, and on north-south streets from West First Street or River Drive in the downtown area. The direction South in street and address numbers are only located in the west end of the city as it sits at a lower latitude, and downtown from Perry Street to the west.  The river bank on the east side of the city is at a higher latitude so there are no South streets there, but some streets use North in their names.  It can be a little confusing as some businesses will give their address, for example, as "North Brady Street" while others will only give it as "Brady Street".  It is all the same as "South Brady Street" is less than a block long, is essentially an entrance to a parking lot and it has no buildings on it.  That is true for most of the streets from Harrison Street in the downtown area and to the east.  The Quad Cities has a  wayfinding  color code system for signs that direct people to various venues and attractions in the area.  The area is divided into quadrants with their own colors and identifying headers on direction signs have the appropriate color for each quadrant so that travelers know, by color, which quadrant you are in and to which color you will have to travel to reach other attractions.  Davenport is in the northwest quadrant and its attractions are on signs that use the green color in the header.  The northeast quadrant (Bettendorf) is yellow, the southeast quadrant (Moline-East Moline) is blue and the southwest quadrant (Rock Island) is red.</field>

		<field name="content">In general Davenport does not have dedicated bicycle lanes on the streets, especially the major thoroughfares so use extreme caution.  Also, snow removal in the winter can be hit or miss depending on the street, so bicycling may not be the best option at that time of year.  This is not to say that Davenport is a bad place for bicycling.  There is an extensive system of recreation trails through the city.  The Riverfront Parkway follows the Mississippi River and cuts through numerous parks as well as downtown.  It is part of the larger multi-state Mississippi River Trail.  A bridge has been added to connect Credit Island to South Concord Street so cyclists no longer have to ride on busy River Drive.  The Duck Creek Parkway is a second trail that runs through the middle of the city from Emeis Park in the west to Duck Creek Park in the east where it connects to the Bettendorf Trail and runs down to the Mississippi River.  In between it connects several other parks.  In time it will connect to the Riverfront Trail.  Other connections are also planned.  While it is possible to use these trails for commuting, their intent was recreational and so their connection between residential and business centers is limited.  Both trails travel east to west and there are no recreational trails that travel north to south at this time.  They do a better job of connecting parks and other recreational facilities.</field>

The major roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all the major areas signposted, but traffic jams around major intersections are common in the afternoons and around the tourist areas on Saturday nights.  The main tourism area is A1A, also known as Atlantic Avenue, a strip of road that runs parallel to the beach for 23 miles (37 km). During major NASCAR races, International Speedway Boulevard gets congested near the racetrack and traffic patterns on other surrounding roads are altered to accommodate the extra traffic. During major motorcycle events, Main Street and Beach Street as well as most of A1A and U.S. Highway 1 experience heavy traffic or are closed. I-95 around exit 273 is also extremely busy during motorcycle rallies.  All major car rental companies are located in or near the Daytona Beach International Airport.

Shoe Repair   Parking on the Ohio Wesleyan University campus is the trickiest of all parking tasks in Delaware. In fact, if you can get to Wesleyan by a method other than car, then that method is recommended. Bus service onto campus from downtown and other areas of Delaware runs very frequently during the day. If you have to park on campus during the day, you will need to get a visitor parking permit from the Department of Public Safety on campus, and then you can park in a spot labeled for visitor parking, which are very few and far between. The public safety officer can give you a map showing where visitor parking spots are, but during a school day, expect to hunt through all of them and not find anything.</field>

		<field name="content">The main road through the park is open to automobile traffic only as far as Savage River (mile 14).  Travel beyond this point is allowed only on the park shuttle buses, on foot, or on a bicycle.  For people camping at Teklanika campground, one automobile per a campsite is allowed to drive in to it.  For those visiting Denali in mid-September the park service opens the road completely for four days after the shuttle buses stop running.  Only 400 vehicles per day are admitted, and each vehicle requires a special permit.  To potentially obtain one of these permits contact the park and inquire about the Denali Road Lottery.  The park service will ask you to mail your address, preference of dates, and a fee during the month of July.  In mid-August you will be contacted if you have been selected.  If snow has not yet closed the road, once the four-day lottery is complete the road will be opened to private vehicles for travel as far as Teklanika Campground (mile 29) until weather closes it for the season.  It is also important to note that the road may close during the road lottery if inclement weather shows up - much to the chagrin of all those people who won a permit only to have it canceled.</field>

		<field name="name">by shuttle bus</field>
		<field name="content">Shuttle buses are allowed past Savage River (mile 15) on the park road, as far as Kantishna (the end of the road).  Passengers may disembark from the buses at any point west of mile 20, and then re-board any bus on a space-available basis.  Anyone disembarking should be aware of the bus schedule, and plan for at least a one hour wait for a bus with seats available to arrive.  A very common question people have about the buses is, "So whats the difference between a shuttle bus and a tour bus."  Simply put, most of the people on tour buses are on packaged trips with the local hotels, and they get a dedicated naturalist on their bus that is required to give commentary throughout the tour.  Buying tickets for tours can be more difficult because the vast majority of the tickets are reserved when people book their packaged vacations.  However, they are not necessarily "better" than a shuttle bus.  Two important facts to note are that all the buses drive the same road (duh, theres only one road inside the park!), and that all the buses have similar destinations.  By similar destinations I mean that theres a tour bus to Eilson Visitor Center and there is also a shuttle bus to Eilson Visitor Center.  So, if you ask, "Which bus is better for seeing wildlife?"  The answer is that they are about the same since they are on the same road going to the same place.  Your experience on the shuttle bus happens to vary quite a bit depending on the driver you get.  Some of the shuttle bus drivers will talk just as much as a tour bus driver, however, they are not required to.  Some of the shuttle bus drivers wont say much of anything unless somebody asks them a question.  Its important to note that a pretty large majority of the bus drivers will give some form of commentary as they drive, because they want to share their love of the park just as much as all the other employees.  Oftentimes, a deciding factor for people on whether to take a shuttle or a tour to Eilson is, "Do I want to pay about $30 for a shuttle bus or about $95 for a tour bus?"  You be the judge.  Shuttle bus reservations can be made either by following the instructions at the National Park Service web site    or in person at the reservation desk in the visitor center.  Be aware that buses may fill several days in advance, especially during the height of the summer visitor season.  2008 Shuttle Bus Prices (including reservation fee):   Riley Creek Shuttle.  Travels between the Railroad/Visitor complex and Riley Creek mercantile, leaving approximately every 30 minutes.  No charge.   Sled Dog Demonstration Shuttle.

There are no late departures for this service. The bus will bring you back about fifteen minutes before the next hour (i.e., 10:45, 2:45, etc.). No charge for either the bus or the demonstration - simply show up at the bus loading area located near the visitor center.   Savage River Shuttle (Mile 14). 2 hour round-trip, leaving hourly during the summer.  No charge.  Savage River is a pretty area which delineates the point at which nearly all private vehicle traffic must stop.  From a bridge over the river, one can see upstream towards the rivers source along a "u-shaped," glacier-carved valley and downstream along a small canyon, cut into the mountains by the rivers passage.  Because of this, and a number of exposed rock formations, it is one of the most geologically interesting areas to explore.  There is also an established trail leading downstream into the canyon, where after half a mile it crosses the Savage via a small foot bridge, and returns to the Park Road.  Total distance: 1 mile; gradient: ~ 0%; difficulty: easy (though it can be extremely windy in the canyon).   Polychrome Pass (Mile 46). 5-hour round-trip, $22.75. Named after the areas multi-colored bluffs, Polychrome Overlook offers spectacular views of the Alaska Range. The Polychrome Shuttle departs only once per day – typically in the early evening (5PM–6PMish) providing opportunities for photography in the great evening light, and a great shorter trip into the park if you have limited time and prefer the latest available departure.   Toklat (Mile 53). 6-hour round-trip, $22.75.  Toklat River is a very pretty, glacially-carved valley, and is home to a temporary ranger station (until Eielson Visitor Center reopens in 2008).  You will have had many opportunities to view Mt. McKinley en route, but there is no chance of viewing the mountain from Toklat River, unless you scale some of the smaller mountains around the river.   Eielson Visitor Center (Mile 66). 8-hour round trip, $29.25. Eielson is most easily reached by shuttle bus and provides one of the most dramatic views of the mountain, if you are lucky enough to visit on a day when it isnt shrouded in clouds.  There are several short trails around the visitor center, and displays inside of the visitor center provide info on the natural history of the area.   Wonder Lake (Mile 86). 11-hour round-trip, $40.00.  Wonder Lake and its approaches offer an entirely new environment to passengers - wetlands.  This can make hiking a bit of a pain, but offers some unique scenic views, as well as a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of bird sightings.  Wonder Lake itself is very beautiful, and close to it is "Reflection Pond," where most of the widespread images of Denali and its reflection have been photographed.  This is also as close as the Park Road gets to Mt. McKinley - within about twenty miles - and on a clear day is a singularly impressive place to be.   Kantishna (Mile 91). 13-hour round-trip, $43.75.  An old mining town, Kantishna predates the park by nearly fifteen years.  The original Mt. McKinley National Park, created in 1917, did not even include Kantishna within its boundaries.  Since the 1980 expansion (and renaming) of the park, however, Kantishna has been inside the park.  There are many private inholdings in the Kantishna area, so day-hikers and backpackers should be on the look-out for private property signs.   Camper Buses (Mile 86). $29.25.  Camper buses will only take passengers with reservations to any campground or with a permit to camp in the backcountry.  If you stay in a campground you can use the Camper Bus as much as you want, but you will have a seat reserved only for the first trip to the campground. Because their function is to transport campers into the park, they take shorter breaks at the rest rooms and spend significantly less time pausing for wildlife or scenic viewing. This is the cheapest to travel by bus into the park and the drivers are generally very friendly.  Youth prices (half the regular price) are for individuals age 15 to 17.  There is no charge on any of the shuttle buses for children age 14 and under.  Important Tips  For shuttle bus trips into the park, be sure to bring all the food, water, and extra clothing you might need.  These are very long trips, and there are no services inside the park other than simple restrooms that have no running water.  Temperatures can also vary a lot, so extra layers are always a good idea.  Smoking and alcoholic beverages are prohibited on the buses.  As of 22 February 2010, a federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal and Alaska state law, to legally possess firearms within Denali National Park and Preserve. Under federal law, the use or discharge of a firearm is still prohibited by applicable provisions of 36 CFR Section 2.4 and 36 CFR Section 13.30. Federal law also prohibits firearms in certain facilities in this park; those places are marked with signs at all public entrances. Visitor Transportation Shuttles, Front Country Shuttle System policy states: A passenger may carry a gun on board a VTS (shuttle) bus so long as the gun is locked in a passenger-provided closed container and is not loaded. Ammunition must be stored separately. It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable Alaska state and federal firearms laws before entering this park. If you bring bear spray with you, you must tell the bus driver so that it can be stored in a compartment under the bus in case of an accidental discharge. There have been incidents of accidental discharge and it pretty much results in an entire bus-full of people getting tear gassed.  You wont make many friends if you do this.  There are some sections of the park road with very steep drop offs, no guard rails, and only enough room on the road for one bus to pass at a time.  If you are afraid of heights, this is your warning.  Some visitors nervously ask, "Heh, how many buses have gone over the edge?"  Unfortunately, the answer is that one bus did go over the edge back in the 70s soon after the bus system was started, and there were a large number of fatalities in this accident.  The incident happened on a steep drop just past Eilson Visitor Center (Mile 66).  This happened at a time when the bus drivers received a very minimal amount of training.  The bus drivers today are put through extensive training before being allowed to drive the park road.  Still, one accident in about 35 years of operation isnt too bad.</field>

		<field name="content">There are few trails within the park, but visitors are allowed (and often encouraged) to choose their own paths across the tundra.  The less-adventurous may choose to simply amble along the park road after Savage River; keep an eye out for buses and wildlife when traveling on the road. Be aware that Denali hosts a large, robust population of brown bears and that they can be anywhere and sow bears are extremely fierce when they feel their cubs are threatened in any way. Always travel in groups and dont go into the backcountry without someone, preferably the park itself, knowing your plans. No one will come looking for you if they dont know you are lost, and Denali is not a place you want to be lost and alone.</field>

		<field name="content">A mountain bike is a great option for traveling on the park road.  Sometimes bikers arrange backcountry permits at the Backcountry Information Center that allow them to spend a few days traveling out to Wonder Lake and back.  This can, however, be logistically tricky - you will need to either spend the night in an established campground or be near enough to one that you can stash your bike (and food if you are not carrying a Bear Resistant Food Canister) overnight.  The only areas where this is possible are: Wonder Lake; Toklat River (you cant sleep there, but you can use the food lockers at the temporary ranger contact station); Igloo Campground (again, you cant stay there, but you can utilize the food lockers if need be); Teklanika Campground; and Savage Campground.  If planning a trip by bike along the park road be prepared for travel on a dirt road with several major mountain passes and few guard rails.  One fun option is to take a bike out to Wonder Lake on a camper bus.  You need to tell the person who you buy the ticket from that you plan to take a bike since only two bikes are allowed per bus.  Once you get to Wonder Lake, you bike back out of the park.  This trip can be done in approximately 10 hours if you keep a good pace.  It is especially enjoyable if you plan this bike trip around the same time as summer solstice.  You can take the last bus going out to Wonder Lake so that you can bike the entire trip back with no buses on the road, all while getting to experience an awe-inspiring bike ride in the land of the midnight sun.</field>

		<field name="content">The glaciated heart of the Park is best accessed by one of the air taxi services located in Talkeetna, south of the Park.  Landing by ski plane on a glacier is a truly memorable experience.  Most air taxis offer glacier landing flights which allow visitors to walk around for a short while on the snow alongside the safe zones of the established airstrips. K2 Aviation   , a pioneering air taxi, also has a lake landing option.  Visitors wanting to venture away from the safety of the airstrips should be well versed in the technical aspects of glacier travel and crevasse rescue or should hire a guide.  Camping on the glacier with huge, glaciated peaks towering above gives a great taste of the immensity of the Alaska Range.  The National Park allows only a few outfitters to operate within its boundaries.</field>

		<field name="content">Renting  If you plan to go outside of downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods car rentals are the most convenient form of transportation. Local companies tend to offer better prices, but national chains might be more convenient as far as return policies and hours.  Rental companies include most major car rental chains.  Parking  Meters are free on Sunday and run until 10 p.m. on weekdays. After 10 p.m. at many of the meters where it was formerly free, it now is $1.00 per hour from 10 p.m. until 8 a.m. at the new "smart meters."  The meters say "overnight parking allowed" but you are still required to pay during this time, or you will get a $25 parking ticket. In the downtown area near Coors Field, The Pepsi Center, and LoDo, there is pretty much no free parking on weekdays. In some areas a few blocks from the city center there are a few non-metered spots within reasonable walking distance of downtown. However, just because you dont see a meter doesnt mean that parking is free. Denver is increasingly using "European-style" meters, where you purchase a paper ticket from a machine somewhere on the block and place it on your dashboard.  Also, many neighborhoods around downtown allow only permitted residents to park, so be sure to check the signs first.  It is worth noting that the city government has been cracking down on parking violations recently, so if you park at a meter with a flashing red light and dont pay, even for a few minutes, EXPECT TO GET A TICKET.  Meter violations will cost you a cool $25 ($50 if you dont pay up within two weeks).  Lack of change is no longer a problem, as all the meters in the downtown area are now equipped with credit card readers that accept Visa and MasterCard.  $1 will get you around an hour, depending on the location of the meter.  Areas outside of the downtown core (20th St, Speer, Wynkoop St, Colfax and Broadway) usually have meters that end at 6 p.m. and are free on weekends, so parking is much easier during those times. The area just northwest of downtown, across the train tracks from Union Station, has free 2-hour parking spots (on Wewatta Street just before the Park Avenue bridge).</field>

		<field name="content">RTD light rail   The  RTD (Regional Transportation District)  operates public transit throughout the Denver area, including buses and light rail.  In 2004, voters approved FasTracks, a plan to significantly expand Denvers public transportation system. However, due to budget problems, this plan wont be fully completed until around 2019 (if at all), so public transportation is still somewhat sparse outside the downtown area.  Denvers existing  light rail  system, though limited, can efficiently get you from downtown to some western, south central, and southeast suburbs. The most recently opened light rail line (opened spring 2013) connects SE Golden, Lakewood, The Denver Federal Center, and Western Denver with Denver Union Station.  Another light rail line travels parallel to I-25 from the southern part of the Denver metro area past the Tech Center, with a small spur on I-225. Yet another light rail line connects downtown Denver to Englewood and Littleton.  Nearly all light rail lines get you to downtown Denver either through central downtown via the Convention Center or to Union Station past Sports Authority Field and the Pepsi Center. Light rail tickets must be purchased (cash or credit card) from vending machines at the stations before boarding the trains. They cost between $2.25 and $5 one way, depending on how far you travel.   Colorado Convention Center and central transportation hub  The backbone of Denvers transportation system is the buses. RTD buses are $2.25 for a one-way local trip, and with payment you receive a transfer thats valid for one hour after the bus arrives at its end terminal. There is also a  free shuttle  along the 16th Street pedestrian mall, which is a little over a mile long and takes you close to most major places downtown. More information about RTD can be found at the Market Street and Civic Center bus stations at either end of 16th Street in downtown, or on the RTD website.  Local routes (denoted by a number) crisscross the city, supplemented by Limited buses that stop less frequently on major arteries like Colfax and Colorado Boulevard.  These buses are denoted by an L after the route number, and cost the same as a Local route.  RTD also operates limited intercity coach service, mostly to the north suburbs and Boulder/Longmont.  These coaches leave from Market Street Station or Civic Center Station at either end of the 16th Street Mall, and will have letters designating their routes.  Fares start at $4.00 one way.  If youre in Colorado to ski or board on a budget, Eldora Mountain Resort in Nederland can be reached from Denver via the B and N buses.  Airport coaches operated by RTD (SkyRide) start from Aisle 5 near the terminal. Fares are between $9 and $13 one way depending on your destination. Ask your driver for a transfer ticket as it will be valid on city buses for one hour after your original bus arrives at its end terminal. Buying a round-trip ticket saves you $2.  Make sure to have change before you use SkyRide or buses. Fare boxes on the buses and coaches do not give change, and vending machines at the stations give change in $1 coins, quite hard to spend later. Keep in mind fare-boxes on buses are cash only!</field>

		<field name="content">Denver has a large network of bike trails leading all over the city.  The city has a fiercely loyal cycling culture, and its reflected in the abundance of bike lanes and trails in and around downtown.  Main trails run along both Cherry Creek and the Platte, and bike lanes run down many downtown streets.  The lanes are sometimes dedicated and sometimes run with traffic, and are marked by a stencil of a bike in the street.  The citys designated routes are signed, and you can pick up a bike map at the info centers downtown and at many bike shops.  Denver was one of the first US cities with a modern  bike share program ; you can purchase a membership online or at any of the 81 stations throughout the city, choose a bike, and start exploring. After the purchase of a membership rides of less than 30 minutes incur no additional fee, while there is a small fee for longer rides.  Dont be afraid to assert yourself in traffic when there is no bike lane - the drivers are, while impatient sometimes, for the most part respectful.  Bikes are treated legally like traffic in Denver, and (while admittedly rare), you can get tickets for running red lights and stop signs.  Bikes are also expected to ride as far to the right as practicable, unless youre riding in a group of 3 or more - in which case you are considered (and can behave like) a car.  Neat, huh?  Bikes are required to have front lights at night, and a good lock is recommended in areas around downtown.  Bike theft happens frequently.</field>

		<field name="content">Drivers who are used to warmer climates should be advised that the colder weather months (Nov-Feb) often bring snow and ice to area roads.  Visitors who park their cars should be prepared in case their car is "snowed in" by snow removal trucks.  Also, strict attention to parking rules and snow emergencies is recommended to avoid being towed away at the car owners expense.  During the winter months, a snow brush, ice scraper, and plenty of windshield washer fluid is essential, and many natives opt to carry a shovel, some sand, and a bag of ice melt/road salt in the trunk just in case.  Gasoline is reasonably cheap in the Des Moines area, partially from subsidies afforded to ethanol which is widely available at most gas stations to travelers.  The most popular mixture, 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, is generally considered safe for newer autos (not to be confused with 85% ethanol/15% gasoline blend).  Ethanol and its usage can stir up quite a debate even in the corn-loving state of Iowa.  The Des Moines River serves as the marker for street names having the prefix "East" or not (and occasionally "West" when on the western side). This is especially important for streets running north-south. "1st Ave" would be on the west side of the river, E 1st Ave the eastern side and are thus completely different streets. Streets running east-west and which exist on both sides of the river typically have an "East" prefix if east of the river.  There are some "West" prefixes for those on the other side of the river but this is less common.  Perhaps more confusing, there are streets which lie on both sides of the river, such as Grand Ave, which is "E Grand Ave" east of the river but simply "Grand Ave" west of the river; yet "E University Ave" is officially named "W University Ave" when on the western side of the river.  Unlike the north-south streets, it is possible to arrive at your destination by simply continuing east or west—depending on your final destination.  The demarcation for "SE" and "SW" prefixes is a bit more ambiguous but would certainly refer to a street south of Grand Ave/E Grand Ave and either the western or eastern side of the river. For most part, "NW" refers to streets west of the river and "NE" east of it, but not always so.  Additionally, there is no standard reference point for determining when a street gains a "NW" or "NE" prefix.  Downtown has several one-way streets to ease traffic flow during rush hours. Turning left is allowed unless otherwise designated.</field>

		<field name="content">Detroit spreads over a large area, it is difficult to be without a car. An extensive freeway system and ample parking make the region one of the most auto-friendly in North America. Detroit has one of Americas most modern freeway systems.  See the Michigan Department of Transportation    website for a current listing of downtown road closures and construction projects. Downtown has parking garages in strategic locations.  Greektown Casino, located  downtown , has a free 13 floor parking garage. Visitors are welcome to pay to park at the Renaissance Center garage. There are plenty of pay-to-park garages, lots, and valet near the Greektown/stadium areas. Premium parking right next to the stadium is well worth the extra price and usually available during a game. Downtown has an ease of entry from the freeways that may surprise new visitors. Valet parking is available at four Renaissance Center locations, the main Winter Garden entrance along the Riverfront, the Jefferson Avenue lobby, Marriott hotel entrance west, and Seldom Blues entrance west.  Detroit has an abundance of taxi, limo, and shuttle services. Car rental prices are reasonable.  While MDOT has since discontinued emphasis on the names of freeways, most locals still cling to their names. Make sure you have an atlas with the names as many road s change names as you go along them.  The Mixing Bowl is the confluence of the Lodge/Northwestern, the Reuther, Telegraph Rd, and Franklin Rd. The Spaghetti Bowl is the confluence of 96/275, the Reuther, the M-5, and the Haggerty Connector. The Junction is the confluence of the Jeffries, 275, and M-14 on the far west side suburbs. The Triangle is the beginning of the Jeffries at the Fisher Freeway. The Interchange is the interchange of the Reuther and the Chrysler Freeways. Many freeways bend and because of this many bends are called Curves:  9 Mile Curve, Gardenia Curve, Rochester Curve, Big Beaver Curve, Crooks Curve all on I-75 Dequindre Curve on I-696 Mound Curve on I-696 Wyoming Curve and Linwood Curve on the Lodge Freeway Fisher/Chrysler Curve: Near downtown Detroit, I-75 makes one of the sharpest turns in the interstate system. It is also the change between the Fisher Freeway and Chrysler Freeway. So if you are going north on the curve it is the Chrysler Curve, if south, the Fisher Curve.  Unlike in most other US cities, traffic signals change to yellow while the pedestrian signal ("hand") is still flashing.  Exercise caution at intersections to avoid hitting pedestrians scrambling to cross the street when the signal is yellow.</field>

		<field name="content">A car is helpful for getting around the rest of the city, but due to the unusual layout and large number of one-way streets, getting out and walking for a few blocks is a good way to see downtown. Bike rentals are available in downtown Detroit along the International Riverfront at Rivard Plaza from Wheelhouse. Downtown and the riverfront are usually bustling with visitors.  Detroit is one of the best cities for biking. Due to the surge and collapse of the auto industry most street have multiple lanes in each direction. Because of sharp population declines there are rarely enough cars to fill all these lanes, therefore bikers can usually have a lane to themselves, a rare occurrence in most cities. Detroit is home to many budding bike co-ops, the most active is The Hub of Detroit, and its sister program Back-Alley Bikes. Both are located in the Cass corridor, on Cass Ave. and Martin Luther King Ave. Back-Alley Bikes has weekly volunteer nights, and monthly women and transgender bike workshops.   The Detroit Critical Mass held on the last Friday of every month is well attended. The Detroit Critical Mass is a guided fun and friendly paced ride, often going through Downtown, passing the old train station, Slows Barbecue, and parts of Mexican town. Critical Mass occasionally meets on Trumbull between Merrick and Warren, near the Woodbridge Pub, though sometimes meets at Grand Circus Park. Check the location and time before you meet-up. Attendance varies with season.</field>

		<field name="content">The  Detroit Department of Transportation  provides mass transit bus service within the city of Detroit. Downtown has a the new Rosa Parks Transit Center. DDOT buses are yellow and green. For safety, DDOT buses may be patrolled by the Wayne County sheriffs deputies. 17 routes serve the central bus terminal, which is downtown at Griswold and Shelby Streets. The standard fare $1.50; transfers are $0.25.  In addition, people traveling throughout Detroit and the suburbs may use the SMART bus system, which services most areas in metro Detroit.   . Standard fare is $2.00 and a transfer is $0.25.  Note that the bus service is worse than in most other cities and should be used only as a last resort (you have too little money for a taxi and cannot drive).</field>

		<field name="content">People Mover   Detroit does not have an elevated/subway network that covers the entire city. In 1987, the  People Mover  was completed, an automated, elevated rail system that runs a three mile loop in the downtown area. It is the best way to get around the downtown area. A round trip excursion, covering 13 stations, takes approximately 20 minutes, and offers great views of the citys downtown landmarks. Signature stops include the Renaissance Center (GM HQ Retail Complex), Greektown, Joe Louis Arena (Home of the Detroit Red Wings), Cobo (Convention) Center, and Cadillac Center (Campus Martius Park). The stations feature original works by local artists. Standard fare $0.75 in cash, and a token can also be bought at the same price.</field>

The trains run about every 5 to 10 minutes at each station. You can board the train at Main Street, New Orleans Square, Mickeys Toontown (Fantasyland), and Tomorrowland. Horse and Carriage: The old-fashioned way to get around is by a horse pulling a cart behind it. This attraction gets you from the Town Square (front of Main Street) to the Hub (center of the park) and back. The attraction runs only in the daytime, during good weather, and when the horses are ready to work. Note the attraction closes about an hour before the first parade of the day. The average horse only works 4 hours a day, 3 days a week in the Disneyland resort. Main Street Vehicles: The Omnibus, Franklin Cars, and Fire Truck. These vehicles run during the early day and before the parades. The vehicles take guests from Town Square to the Hub and back. These vehicles stop during any entertainment on Main Street that takes place in the street. These are real cars from the turn of the last century, running daily in Disneyland.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving is probably the best option for getting around Duluth. The city generally does not have any traffic problems, although it can get congested in Canal Park. The city is built on a rather steep hill, so if you travel around anywhere other than downtown or I-35, make sure your brakes are in good order.  It can be slushy in the winter as the road crews typically put down salt first, then plow the roads when traffic is lighter.  However, being on the west side of the lake, Duluth doesnt normally receive the large lake-effect snowfalls, 2" to 6" is the normal snowstorm. US Highway 53 crosses from Wisconsin to the south to the Iron Range in the north, and will take you to Miller Hill Mall, on top of the hill on the west side. US Highway 2 runs east-west. Keep in mind that the majority of the city is laid out in a grid based on the Lake Superior shoreline.  This is about 45 degrees off of true north, however the residents refer to east/west streets running parallel to the lake, and north/south avenues that are perpendicular to the lake.  Lake Avenue is considered to be the dividing line between east and west.</field>

		<field name="content">It should be mentioned that like Atlantas infamous "Peachtree", Durham has a number of synonymous roadways, in some cases miles from each other. This can easily confuse visitors. The most notorious is Chapel Hill Rd/St/Blvd. The road goes from the citys Lakewood and West End neighborhoods to the Chapel Hill border via Shannon Plaza and the fringe of the South Square area. Mostly residential. The St acts as an arterial from downtown through West End, serving as a vibrant thoroughfare for the neighborhoods in between. "The Boulevard" as it is known in the neighborhoods surrounding it, courses from the foot of the Forest Hills neighborhood and bee-lines directly west to Chapel Hill, eventually becoming 15-501. Mainly commercial with lots of big-box retailers and chain restaurants. When in doubt, ask a local!  Parking is plentiful in Durham, even in the more populous areas. Be mindful of parking in residential zones in the city for extended periods without a permit.</field>

CATA enjoys high ridership along lines servicing MSU. CATA won APTAs Americas Best Transit System award for 1991 in the medium-size category, and again for 2007 in the 4–30 million annual passenger trips category. This award is given to systems with great efficiency and cost-effectiveness, a high safety rating, and a stable operations base, among other criteria. In 2008, CATA was recognized in the October issue of "Metro Magazine" as one of the Ten Best Places to Work in Transit. The article chronicled CATAs family-like culture, recognition of hard work, extreme efficiency, the Open-door policy of the executive office, and the pride CATAs workers mentioned in their employee surveys. CATA logged a record-breaking 11,306,339 rides in fiscal year 2008, a 5.8% increase over the previous years record of 10,682,792, following several years of unprecedented growth.</field>

		<field name="content">Hiking routes exist throughout the monument. Most traverse lava flows and are marked with rock cairns. Few dirt routes exist. Backcountry hiking and cave exploration is permitted, but no water is available. Topographical maps and a compass or GPS unit are strongly suggested for backcountry exploration. Please stop by a visitor center for the parks caving policy and information prior to entering any cave. Entry to most caves requires permits in advance of your visit. Use extreme caution hiking on lava terrain - its sharp and unstable! Please dont hike or cave alone.</field>

		<field name="content">Erie is laid out in an easy to understand grid pattern paralleling the Lake Erie coastline.  Numbered streets starting with the northern most 2nd Street run roughly east-west.  (The bayfront highway loops around this grid, taking the place of what would be a "1st Street".  Major E/W thoroughfares are 6th, 12th, 26th and 38th Street.  The center of town is split north-south by State Street.  N/S streets on the west side of town are typically named after trees (Peach, Poplar, Chestnut) and on the east side after countries (French, German, Holland).  The two major north-south routes through the center of town are State and Peach (Peach diverges to the southwest after 26th street.)  Major N/S streets listed from west to east are Pittsburgh, Greengarden, Liberty, Chestnut, Peach, State, French, Parade, East.  As you can see, this naming convention is not hard and fast, and breaks down in all directions the further you get from the city center.  The suburbs of Fairview, Millcreek, Harborcreek, Lawrence Park and Wesleyville also stick to this rough grid pattern to some degree as you move away from the city.</field>

		<field name="content">The National Capital area (including Fairfax County) is the 9th largest metropolitan area in the U.S.,  but has the 5th worst traffic congestion in the U.S.      Both  I-95  and U.S. Route 1 pass through Fairfax County, on their way from Maine to Florida.   I-95 , the major North-South Interstate on the East Coast, joins the I-495 Beltway to points South, at the Springfield Interchange (a.k.a. the Mixing Bowl).  The Southwestern portion of the Capital Beltway (I-495) runs through Fairfax County. The Legion Bridge connects to Montgomery County, MD, in the North. The Wilson Bridge connects to Southeast Washington, DC, and Prince Georges County, MD, to the East.   I-395 runs from the Springfield Interchange Northeast to Washington, DC.  I-66 runs from the West to Washington, DC.  U.S. Route 1, the original North-South highway on the East Coast, runs due North through Alexandria and Arlington to Washington, DC, and South to Prince William County, VA, passing through downtown shopping districts all the way.  U.S. Route 50, the original East-West transcontinental highway, passes through Fairfax County on its way from California to Maryland. It joins I-66 to cross into Washington, DC, on the Roosevelt Bridge.  Fairfax County Parkway is a North-South highway, West of the Beltway.  Inside the Beltway, major streets move in seemingly random directions, with heavy stop and go traffic. It may seem as though theyre all named Chain Bridge, Lee, and/or Jackson!</field>

		<field name="content">The most fun and most approved by conservationists method to travel around Fairlee is by bicycle.  Unfortunately, there are no renting shops near-by, so youll have to supply your own.  The circumference of the lake is roughly 5 miles, so a morning bike around the hilly mountainside is just the thing to get your blood pumping.  Within a few miles from anywhere around the lake is the town making the bike a viable option for travel.</field>

Once again, theres no renting available, but a snowmobile is the best way to beat the difficult winter roads, and is considered completely acceptable by locals.  Beware exiting the frozen lake through residents beach fronts, though, some residents take trespassing matters into their gun-owning hands.</field>

		<field name="content">A cluster of major roads intersect in Seven Corners, where you had better pay attention to the signs if you want to wind up on the right road! The main roads have at least two names a piece, which complicates things: US-50/Arlington Blvd, VA-7/Leesburg Pike/Broad St, and US-29/Lee Hwy/Washington St. Wilson Blvd is the other main road, where you will find Eden Center immediately northeast of Seven Corners on the way up to  Arlington . I-66 runs east-west just to the north of the City of Falls Church; I-495, the Capital Beltway, runs along West Falls Churchs western border, with the US-50 exit being the most useful.  Avoid driving during morning rush hour (7:30AM-10:30AM) towards D.C., and vice versa in the afternoon (4PM-7PM). Note that on weekdays eastbound I-66 is HOV-2 only 6:30AM-9AM and westbound is HOV-2 only 4PM-6:30PM.</field>

		<field name="content">Also see Eden Center map below   The Metrorail goes out to Falls Church via the Orange Line, with West Falls Church and East Falls Church stops (right at I-66), but neither are actually in the City of Falls Church, nor particularly convenient for anyone without a car! Ballston is often better if you want to connect to a bus, as it is also closer to D.C. Bus users should make a note of Seven Corners Transit Center, where you can transfer between all the most useful bus routes, and which is just across the street from Eden Center.  Buses 1A, 1B, and 1E    all run from the Ballston Metro stop down Wilson Blvd to Eden Center (just before Seven Corners, past Roosevelt), taking roughly 20 minutes.  Buses 4A and 4H    are the only options for US-50/Arlington Blvd, and only depart from one Metrorail stop: far-away Rosslyn. You can pick them up from the Seven Corners Transit Center, though, across the street from Eden Center, where you can also connect up with the aforementioned Wilson Blvd buses.  Bus 28A    is a pretty cool route, more so for getting to Tysons Corner to the north, but it runs the length of VA-7/Leesburg Pike between West Falls Church and King St/Alexandria Metrorail stations, with a stop at the Seven Corners Transit Center.</field>

The canal villages usually have tie-ups near their downtown areas, though availability (and fees) vary.

		<field name="content">While it might be possible in theory to explore Flint without a car, very few people would want to do so.  Even after one considers the time and effort saved here, there is something singularly appropriate about traveling the boulevards and parkways, the industrial zones and factory strips, in the vehicle this city helped popularize.  Of course, it also helps that Flint is a delight to drive, with a coherent network of roads and expressways linking the city to the suburbs, and abundant parking and a lack of congestion (ironically due to Flints recent depopulation).  Among the citys much-touted $400 million redevelopment efforts are miles of infrastructural repaving and repair, and it is generally possible to get between any two points of the city in ten or fifteen minutes, or to access the remotest suburbs in well under an hour.  The streetscape of Flint is based on two grids, one which conforms to the river for several square miles in proximity to Downtown, and another which is cardinally oriented.  While Flint by-and-large conforms to its grids, there is enough topographical variation to cause many roads to split and angle.  Some major roads the follow this pattern are Welch Blvd., Flushing Rd., Chevrolet Ave., Miller Rd., Sagniaw St., and Dort Hwy.  Within some neighborhoods, the broader streets become curving boulevards with grassy medians, and sometimes this is the only relic of a formerly affluent area.  The Downtown area is uniquely frustrating for driving.  Most roads are one way, sometimes in an unordered sequence, which is maddening given the lack of heavy traffic.  Saginaw Street bisects this area from north to south, and dividing east and west addresses, while the bridge at Saginaw street divides the city into north and south.  In the larger grid, neighborhoods are divided by major "mile" roads: to the north (running east-west) one passes Hamilton or Davison, Pasadena, Pierson, and Carpenter, to the south (running east-west) Court, Lippincott, Atherton, and Hemphill (on the half-mile), to the east (running north-south), Lewis, Dort, and Center, and to the west (running north-south) Fenton or Saginaw, Dupont, and Ballenger or Clio.  It will be important to have a map: while these roads are generally straight, they dont always connect up as one would expect, and it should be easy to navigate as long as you can maintain a basic orientation.  For getting around the city quickly, though, and for reaching most of the suburbs, nothing is faster than Flints four expressways: I-69, I-75, I-475, and US-23.  A trained Flintite can use this network of 70mph roads to go from a coney at Angelos (see below) to a shake at the Atlas (see below) in about five minutes.  I-75 runs to the west of Flint, with access (from south to north) to I-475, US-23 (only driving south) Bristol, I-69, Miller, Corunna, Pierson, Mt. Morris, and 475 again.  I-475 runs through east Flint proper (meeting up with 75 outside the city) with access (from south to north) to Hill, Bristol, Hempill, Atherton, I-69, Court (only driving south), Robert T. Longway, Davison/Hamilton, Stewart, Pierson, Carpenter, Saginaw St. (in Mt. Morris), Clio Rd., and I-75.  I-69 runs through south Flint proper with access (from east to west) to Center, Dort, I-475, Saginaw, Hammerberg, and I-75.  US-23 splits from I-75 just south of Flint, serving the south suburbs.  With a map in your hand, this network is not only sane; it is comprehensible and convenient.</field>

		<field name="content">Flint currently has little in the way of bicycling trails, although development is planned to extend these further throughout the city and suburbs, particularly throughout the West Side.  The most extensive bike route is currently the Flint River Trail which extends north from downtown Flint to the city of Genesee on the Halloway Reservoir.  Other routes link the Riverfront trail to Downtown, the Cultural Center, and Kearsley Park.  Due to Flints relatively compact size, many attractions are within a short distance of each other by bike.  Cyclists are urged to use caution, however, especially on major thoroughfares such as Robert T. Longway or Chavez Drive, as traffic can be fast and heavy, and hills and curves tend to obstruct vision for both cyclists and motorists.</field>

		<field name="content">Car rental agencies abound in Florida and many are available at every major airport.  Orlando, in particular, known as the "Car Rental Capital of the World". With Florida being the most visited state in the US, car rental rates here are among (if not the) lowest rates in the country.   Floridas major highways include:  Interstate 4 crosses diagonally from  Tampa , heads east through  Plant City   Lakeland , then heads northeast past  Kissimmee ,  Walt Disney World ,  Orlando , and ends at Interstate 95 near  Daytona Beach . Interstate 4 is the most traversed highway in Florida and due to the large volume of traffic, high speeds (70 outside of urban areas), construction (which is almost complete), and large number of tourists it is the most dangerous highway in the state, in terms of the number of accidents. Interstate 95 enters Florida from Georgia north of Jacksonville and travels near the Atlantic coast (never more than 20mi or so), past St.Augustine, Daytona Beach, Cape Canaveral, Vero Beach, West Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, and ends at US 1 just south of downtown Miami. Interstate 10 enters Florida from Alabama near Pensacola and travels across the Panhandle, past Tallahassee,and  through north Florida to its terminus in Jacksonville. Interstate 75 enters Florida from  Georgia  and runs south through  Gainesville ,  Ocala , just east of  Tampa , then parallels the Gulf coast past  Bradenton ,  Sarasota ,  Fort Meyers ,  Naples , and then crosses due east across the  Everglades  swamp (a section known as Alligator Alley) to the Miami suburbs. Floridas Turnpike is a toll road that runs from Interstate 75 south of Ocala, through Orlando, West Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, and ending south of Miami. It provides the easiest access to Orlando and southeast Florida for persons entering the state via I-75 or I-10. Interstate 275 is a secondary interstate that runs from I-75 north of Bradenton, past downtown St. Petersburg downtown Tampa, before rejoining I-75 north of the Tampa area. Interstate 275 crosses the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, 5.5mi (8.8km) long and with a 193ft(58.8m) clearance, across the mouth of Tampa Bay and later across the Howard Frankland Bridge over Old Tampa Bay. Note: Interstate 75 does not provide access to these areas, it passes through rural/suburban areas 10 miles (at closest) from Tampa. I-4 approaches Tampa from the east, but ends at I-275 just before downtown.  U.S. Highway 1  is a historic and scenic highway that originates in  Key West  and continues up the east coast.  State Road A1A runs parallel to US 1 and Interstate 95, but lies to the east of the Intercoastal Waterway (mainly on the barrier islands) and running mostly along the ocean. US 98 enters Florida from Alabama at Pensacola and travels a very scenic route along the Gulf Coast of the Panhandle, it continues diagonally across the peninsula to its terminus in West Palm Beach.  US 27 is a well-traveled alternative to the Floridas Turnpike and runs from Miami, along Lake Okeechobee, through the mostly-rural heartland of Florida, Ocala, Gainesville, Tallahassee US 41 runs from Miami, makes a scenic 2-lane journey through the Everglades, and travels along the Gulf Coast, the east side of Tampa Bay, and north into Georgia.</field>

		<field name="content">The easiest way to get around Fort Lauderdale and South Florida is by car. If you are rentingmdash;all the major national chains, and several local ones, can be found heremdash;it is substantially less money to rent a car from a location outside of the airport. The city is set up on grid system and is fairly easy to navigate.  Downtown is roughly two miles west of the beach. You need to consult a map when on the the East side of town because the canals divide up the city and you need to find the bridges.   Broward County is served by three major Interstates (I-75, I-95, I-595) and some U.S. Highways including  U.S. Highway 1 , US 27 and US 441. It is also served by Floridas Turnpike and State Highway 869, also known as the Sawgrass Expressway.</field>

		<field name="content">When you visit the beach you will see that many locals bike to the beach. Things in Fort Lauderdale are close, but often further apart than a quick walk.  A bike makes everything much closer, and you dont have to find parking. By bike, it is only 10 minutes from the beach to downtown, the supermarkets, or the malls.  A bike creates its own breeze so biking is not only quicker and less effort than walking, its often cooler too.  You can rent a bike, or, if you know you are going to be staying more than a couple of days, it may be more cost effective to buy a $100 bike from a big discount store and sell it or pass it on when you go home. (If you stay a week, you can just about pay for a bike in the money you save on parking.)  There are bike lanes on the road by the beach on A1A and on Las Olas Blvd. going between the beach and downtown and the Riverwalk. Ride in the same direction as the traffic. It is common to take to the sidewalks on the bridges or  or on major roads when the bike lane disappears.   Because most things are quite close and Florida is very flat, bicycles are a very green, very sane, and relatively quick way to get around. You also get to see more, hear more, and be able to stop easily along the way to take pictures, something that is difficult to do when in a taxi or a car.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving is the preferred method for getting around.  Fremont streets are usually easy to navigate as difficult intersections were re-engineered for efficiency several decades ago, though some corridors such as Mission Blvd remain moderately congested.    The major freeways through Fremont are the bayside Nimitz (I-880) and the inland I-680.  Although the two freeways are only a mile apart in Fremont-Warm Springs, they do not intersect.  Motorists will find travel to be very slow during commute hours in the unfavorable direction; especially so on I-880.  Mission Blvd crosses I-680 twice at Exits 16 and 12.  Locals sometimes refer to Exit 16 as "North Mission" and Exit 12 as "South Mission."   Fremont Blvd crosses I-880 twice at Exit 22 and Exit 13.  The locals call Exit 22 "North Fremont" and Exit 13 "South Fremont."  So if someone tells you to take the "Fremont Blvd" exit or the "Mission Blvd" exit, make sure you know which one theyre talking about.  The exit number increases as you move north.</field>

		<field name="content">Bike lanes are present on many major roads in Fremont.  For maximum safety, avoid the large roads that lead to the freeway since they are the most congested, and your bike isnt going to go on the freeway anyway, is it?  The city of Fremont publishes a bikeway path on its website    showing bike paths, trails, alternate routes for bikes, and detailing which intersections are tricky or dangerous.  Print copies of the map are available at various government buildings or by ordering through the web site.</field>

Bus routes and schedules are designed for the daily commuter, not the casual traveler.  In the middle of the day, buses may run as infrequently as once per hour, so be sure you have an up-to-date bus schedule and know when your bus is coming.  The Fremont BART station serves as a bus terminal for transferring between the various bus routes.</field>

		<field name="content">CT Transit, +1 860 247-0200,   . Public bus service throughout the Greater Hartford Area. Most bus-stops receive service every 15-30 Minutes. Most destinations are accessible by bus, but one must be careful to get off at the correct stops. The general fare is $1.30 with one free transfer. All day passes are available for $3.25 and can be purchased from the bus driver. 3-day, 5-day, 7-day, and 31-day passes are also available; these can be purchased online    (allow 7 days for delivery) or in person at the CT Transit Customer Service and Sales Outlet located at State and Market Streets next to the Old State House (M-F 7AM-6PM, Sa 9AM-3PM, Su and major holidays closed). If you miss your stop by more than a few blocks, stay on the bus and it will eventually return to Downtown Hartford. An additional $1.25 may be asked if you do not have a free transfer/all day pass, but it will still save you much time.  The Downtown area has a free shuttle run by CT Transit, called the  Star Shuttle . It runs Monday-Friday 7AM to 7PM. Three buses run during peak weekday hours, with two buses normally in service. Services run approximately every 15 minutes. The route connects the CT Convention Center, the Riverfront, the Arts and Entertainment District, various restaurants, and downtown hotels. For special events the shuttle is usually put into action if it was not originally scheduled to run (such as later in the evening or on weekends).</field>

		<field name="content">Distances, as with most places in America, are fairly large but there are good footpaths all around Homer and if you are fit walking can be a great way to see and get a feel for the town. Homer  is laid out rather oddly, in "chunks" of areas with businesses  separated by residential areas or wetlands. There are paved bike/walking paths on Homer East Road (locally known exclusively as East end road) on Ocean Drive and the Beluga Slough, and on most of the Spit. If you are walking, pedalling, or roller-blading in these areas it is recommended that you stay on the paths and off the roads. Be aware that it is a distance of about five miles  from the center of town to the harbor area on the Spit and it can become very windy and cold at any time anywhere in coastal Alaska. Alaskans know that wearing layers that can be added or removed easily is the key to being comfortable outdoors in this highly variable environment.  You can rent bicycles at Homer Saw and Cycle.</field>

		<field name="title">Honolulu</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">navigating</field>
		<field name="content">Unlike many cities on the U.S. mainland, Honolulu is not laid out in a strict compass-point grid.  Its street system conforms in large part to the shorelines, valleys, and ridges, with lots of twists and turns.  It can be confusing for people used to straight grid systems.  However, at the same time, it is not that difficult to navigate in, as long as you are familiar with the major arterials and terminology below.  Because it is difficult to differentiate north and south on an island, directions are normally given in terms of local landmarks.  The most common terms that you will run into are mauka (Mow-kah) meaning "toward the mountain" and makai (mah-KAI) meaning "toward the sea".  In the case of Honolulu, which is on Oahus south shore, "mauka" is a rough north, and "makai" roughly south.  You will also hear Ewa-bound (Eh-vah) and Town-bound used a lot, in relation to downtown Honolulu, the former roughly means "west" (toward the town of Ewa on the southwest shore of Oahu) and the latter roughly means "east" (towards Honolulu; locals refer to Honolulu proper as "town"). Highway signs, however, will use standard compass directions, so if you are asked to go Ewa-bound on the freeway, look for the on-ramp to H-1 west.  It is a very good idea to invest in a good map of Honolulu before doing extensive driving.  Members of the American Automobile Association (AAA) can request fold-out maps for free from their local office.  Rand McNally paper fold-out maps are available in many stores; for more extensive coverage you can also purchase Bryans Sectional Maps (a popular choice among locals) at most bookstores for about $9.50.  GPS-enabled devices can also be used to navigate around Honolulu, and Oahu.  Streets in Honolulu can be extremely narrow compared to the mainland. Locals are used to this lack of space on roads but if you are coming from the mainland and are used to wide roads, prepare yourself for driving very close to the cars around you. Just take a little extra caution and you should not have any problems. Once outside of Honolulu proper, the roads will be a bit wider.  Please take note that many intersections on busy streets in town do prohibit left turns, especially intersections on Kapiolani Boulevard, due to flow of traffic and other various reasons.  If coming from the mainland, speed limits on roads in Honolulu are generally lower than you may be used to. For example, six-laned King Street is 25–30 miles per hour for its entire length. Most streets are no more than 25 miles per hour. In addition to this, many people disregard the speed limit, instead driving slower, which may be frustrating.  During periods of rain at night, the lane markings on the roads will not be easily visible even to people with excellent vision. Take extreme caution during these times.</field>

		<field name="name">rules of the road</field>
		<field name="content">There are a few rules to take note of, especially if you come from a foreign country and are not used to driving in the United States:  City and County ordinance prohibits using or simply holding any electronic device while behind the wheel. This includes (but isnt limited to) a cell phone, iPod, or a GPS. Hands-free use is required, otherwise do not use them at all. If pulled over, you may want to hide (discreetly) any electronic devices to avoid fines. Using your in-car radio, however, is allowed. You can assume that if there is no sign posted, you may turn right on a red light. Pedestrians always have the right of way, even if not in the crosswalk. During the morning and afternoon rush-hour, some streets have contra-flow lanes. Lanes from the direction less heavily traveled will be blocked off with cones and cars traveling in the other direction will allowed to use the lane. During these times, there are no left turns allowed against heavy traffic. On busier streets, cars may not be parked on the side of the road during rush hour. This is heavily enforced, and often results in a parking ticket with fine and immediate towing at the expense of the driver. Many streets allow street parking on one side and traffic to travel on the other. When on these streets, most times the road is not wide enough to allow two way traffic. In this case, cars traveling opposite the direction of the parked cars have the right of way, and cars traveling the same direction as the parked cars must pull over to allow the other cars to pass.</field>

		<field name="name">major arterials</field>
		<field name="content">Most major streets in Honolulu run Ewandash;Diamond Head (as described in the preceding section, roughly east-west).  There are two main highways in Honolulu:  Nimitz Highway (Hawaii 92) which runs from Pearl Harbor past Honolulu Airport to downtown Honolulu and Waikiki; and Interstate H-1 which runs mauka (mountain-ward) of downtown and runs the entire length of the south shore of Oahu.  H-1 is some distance away from Waikiki itself and you need to go onto surface streets to and from Waikiki.  If you need to access H-1 west from Waikiki to go someplace outside of the city, there are three main routes:  Go mauka to Ala Wai Boulevard and follow it Ewa-bound to McCully Street.  Follow McCully mauka for about 1 mile; it will take you over H-1.  At the foot of the bridge, turn left on Dole, then left again onto Alexander to the freeway onramp.  Follow Kuhio or Kalakaua Avenue Diamond Head-bound to Kapahulu Avenue.  Follow Kapahulu mauka for about 1 mile, it will take you under H-1 and lead you to the freeway onramp.  To get back to Waikiki from H-1 east, take any of these routes:  Take exit 22 (Kinau Street). Turn right on Ward Avenue and follow it to Ala Moana Boulevard.  Turn left on Ala Moana and follow it into Waikiki.  Take exit 23 (Punahou Street).  Turn right on Punahou, and stay in lane 3 from the left.  This lane is right-turn only onto the left side of Beretania.  Take an immediate left onto Kalakaua Avenue from Beretania.  Follow Kalakaua into Waikiki.  Take exit 25A (King Street).  After merging onto King Street, stay to the right.  Take the second right onto Kapahulu Avenue (follow signs to Waikiki).  Follow Kapahulu into Waikiki.  Take exit 23 (Punahou Street).  Stay straight to merge onto Bingham Street. Turn right onto McCully Street and keep left to merge into traffic from the overpass. Follow McCully to Waikiki.  There are also several routes from H-1 to downtown and back. To get to downtown from H-1 east, use one of these routes:  Take exit 21B (Punchbowl Street). This will take you to the Capitol area.  Take exit 21A (Pali Highway). Turn right onto Pali Highway, which will curve to the left and become Bishop Street. This will take you to the downtown business district and Aloha Tower.  Take exit 22 (Kinau Street). Turn right onto Ward Avenue, then turn right onto Beretania Street. This will take you to the Capitol area and Chinatown.  Take exit 20B (Vineyard Blvd). This will take you to northern downtown.  To get to H-1 west from downtown, use one of these routes:  Go north on Punchbowl Street (from the Capitol area), which will merge into a ramp at the end of the street. At the fork at the end of the ramp, keep left.  Go north on Alakea Street (from Chinatown), turn left onto Beretania Street, turn right onto Pali Highway, turn left onto School Street, and keep left onto the H-1 ramp.  Go east on Kinau Street, turn left onto Piikoi Street, turn left onto Lunalilo Street, then keep left onto the H-1 ramp.  Go west onto Vineyard Blvd, which will become Halona Street after the H-1 overpass. Keep left onto the H-1 ramp.  In central Honolulu, the two main streets are King Street and Beretania Street.  The two streets are one-way for most of their route; King Street runs from Ewa to Diamond Head, and Beretania Street from Diamond Head to Ewa.  Both streets run parallel through downtown Honolulu.  Despite their rough west to east orientation, addresses on these streets are designated North and South respectively (the streets form an S curve, running north-south through downtown).  The dividing line between North and South designations is Nuuanu Avenue in downtown Honolulu, which runs mauka-makai.  Ala Moana Boulevard is a key route leading out of Waikiki to Downtown Honolulu.  Past Honolulu Harbor, Ala Moana becomes Nimitz Highway and runs all the way to the airport and beyond.  Tree-lined Kapiolani Boulevard is another major thoroughfare traversing east-central Honolulu, linking the Waikiki district and points east with downtown Honolulu, becoming Waialae Avenue in Kaimuki. Dillingham Boulevard runs from Middle Street in Kalihi to Aala Park right outside of Chinatown, then continues as Liliha Street into Liliha. McCully Street runs from Waikiki to the H-1 Freeway, an easy route to get to the interstate and out of town, or just to get out of Waikiki. Two major streets from Ala Moana to residential Makiki and the H-1 are Pensacola Street and Piikoi Street, running makai to Ala Moana and mauka to Makiki, respectively. Downtown, Pali Highway from the Windward side of the island becomes Bishop Street, a major one-way thoroughfare through the compact downtown running makai to Aloha Tower, and its counterpart Alakea Street is one block east, running from Aloha Tower to Vineyard Boulevard, which forms the unofficial northern border for downtown. Through working class Kalihi is Kalihi Street, which becomes Likelike Highway running to Kaneohe on the windward side.  In Waikiki, the three main streets, from makai to mauka, are Kalakaua Avenue (one way Ewa to Diamond Head, along Waikiki Beach), Kuhio Avenue (two-way), and Ala Wai Boulevard (one way Diamond Head to Ewa, along the Ala Wai Canal).</field>

		<field name="name">traffic</field>
		<field name="content">Traffic in Honolulu, and on Oahu in general (in particular the southern shore), is a persistent problem.  In fact, Honolulus rush hour has been ranked among the worst in the nation.  There are almost one million people living in a relatively small space, and only a few main routes connecting the major populated areas on the island to each other and to downtown Honolulu. As a result, a single traffic incident has the potential to induce gridlock across the entire island. You are unlikely to encounter a traffic jam of that magnitude, but someone visiting Oahu and traveling during a weekday should be aware of traffic problems.  Normal weekday rush hour in Honolulu is 5AM to 8AM going inbound and 3PM to 6:30PM going outbound.  Expect heavy traffic on Interstates H-1 and H-2, Nimitz Highway/Ala Moana Boulevard, and the surface streets in downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. However, traffic congestion is the norm for most of the daylight hours, often crawling along at less than ten miles per hour on the freeway, and often congested near onramps and offramps on the surface streets. There is almost always a slow down during the day on the H-1 between the Likelike and Punahou exits, often in both directions. On the H-1 eastbound (toward downtown Honolulu), the interchange at Middle Street (H-1 H-201), the Vineyard Boulevard and Ward Avenue onramps, and the H-1/H-2 Merge are some of the worst bottlenecks, especially during rush hour. The merge at Middle Street has been named the single most congested section of freeway in the United States. Traffic is less heavy during the summer and over the holidays when the University of Hawaii at Manoa and public and private schools are not in session. Maybe a unique thing about Honolulu is that while traffic congestion is high, drivers are generally courteous and will let you in front of them if you signal beforehand and wave after.  All in all, though, driving on Oahu is pleasurable once you get off of the Interstates. Having a car on Oahu gives a visitor a chance to visit the whole island in just a few days. Once you get a little ways inland, the traffic is not too bad, and in the agricultural areas there is little traffic. Unless you are familiar with this climate, convertible tops should be up when the sun is intense.</field>

TheBus runs intercity services to other parts of Oahu as well. Ask for a free transfer ticket, good for two hours, if you are continuing on another bus or returning on the same route.  Monthly bus passes are available at 7-Elevens and supermarkets.  Monthly bus passes begin on the first of each month and cost $60 (all-you-can-ride) regardless of which day of the month you purchase the pass.  A $25 4-day  Discovery Pass , can be purchased at an ABC Store.  You scratch off the Month and day of your first use and each subsequent day (up to four total days) and enjoy unlimited rides.  You can use the pass to take any bus including the Circle Island route and see the entire island.  Yearly bus passes are also available for $660.  All buses in the fleet are equipped with bike racks that can hold two or three bikes.  Buses are also wheelchair accessible. Larger groups may want to tour the city via charter bus; there are several chartering companies available on the island.</field>

		<field name="content">Houston has a number of major highways that make getting around Houston fairly easy. (See list of freeways under the "Get in" section.)  A number of obstacles, however, can make driving in Houston a less than pleasant experience.  One is construction, which seems to be ever-present, and the other is traffic.  Evening rush hour in Houston begins as early as 4 PM and can last more than 2 hours.  Morning rush hour is between 7 and 9 AM.  During rush hour, traffic on the highways can come to a halt.  The strip of the West Loop near the Galleria, between US-59 and IH-10, is an area you should definitely avoid during rush hour if possible.   Houston Traffic Map    The outstanding freeways system     Some of the freeways have an H.O.V. (High-Occupancy Vehicle) lane, which are limited-access lanes located in the median strip of the highway.  The HOV lanes are operational Monday - Friday in the morning hours (5AM - 11AM) in the inbound direction and in the outbound direction in the afternoon and evening (from 2PM - 8PM). The HOV lanes are restricted to cars with 2 or more passengers, however some HOV lanes require 3 or more passengers during peak travel periods (6:45-8:00AM and 5-6PM, for IH-10 west; 6:45-8AM only for US-290).  The HOV lanes are marked with signs bearing a white diamond on a black background.  Highways with HOV lanes are: IH-45 North, IH-45 South, US-59 North, US-59 South, IH-10 West (Katy Freeway), and US-290.  The Katy Freeway HOV lanes have been expanded into the Katy Toll Road, a 24-hour multi-lane HOV with paid Single-Occupancy Vehicle access cost-adjusted based on HOV usage.

		<field name="content">Idaho is served by several Interstate highways. I-90 in North Idaho passes through  Coeur dAlene . I-84 enters Idaho at the  Oregon  border, serves the  Boise  metro area and passes near  Twin Falls  en route to  Salt Lake City . I-15 serves the Eastern Idaho cities of  Pocatello  and  Idaho Falls . The short I-86 in South Central and Eastern Idaho connects I-84 and I-15.  Most other main roads in the state are two-lane highways. In more remote locations unpaved roads are commonplace. Pay close attention to current road conditions while traveling, particularly in winter. You know youre from Idaho when your elderly grandparents think its normal to arrive at Christmas (or even just for a weekend visit) after driving 400 miles through blizzards and along winding two lane river roads.    Crossing into  Montana  often involves going through mountain passes. This is particularly true when not on I-90 or I-15. In the winter, check with the highway department for pass conditions -- many passes are closed from the first snow until mid-April.  The two-lane US 95 and Idaho State Highway 55 serve as the only intrastate connections between  North Idaho  and the rest of the state. Even in ideal weather conditions, traveling by car from North Idaho to Eastern Idaho invariably involves a drive through Boise or through  Missoula , Montana. Either way, youll drive 600 - 700 miles when its something like 300 miles as the crow flies.</field>

		<field name="content">Flying is an expensive but wonderful way to get around and see the majestic scenery. Although many of the states smaller airports have no commercial flights at all, while others (such as Twin Falls) dont have regular flights to other parts of the state, backcountry flights are available from many locations, and you get to fly through canyons and into remote airstrips that are nearly unreachable any other way. Examples are  McCall Aviation  and  Selway Aviation  in Central Idaho.  If you just want to go city-to-city, call Horizon Airlines.</field>

		<field name="content">Indy Go buses will take you to any neighborhood in Indianapolis   Indy Go  is the public bus system. It travels throughout the city and suburbs. Single fares are $1.75, day passes are available for $4, and all buses are equipped with two bike racks. The bus system is a very nice way to travel with the one exception of frequency—outside of rush hour routes, you can find yourself with a 30+ minute wait. Almost all routes travel from a locality in the outskirts of the city to the centrally-located bus stops downtown and back out; there are also a handful of smaller circulators and loops.  Perhaps the most useful route for visitors is  17 College , which runs between all of the citys most popular dining and nightlife strips. It runs between Broad Ripple Ave and Downtown, where it travels along the popular Mass Ave strip, and loops around Capitol, Ohio, Delaware, and Maryland. Runs roughly M–F 5AM–9:30PM, Sa 6AM–9:30PM, Su 7PM–9PM.   8 Washington St  is a good route to travel quickly west of downtown to the Zoo and the Canal. It runs west through downtown on Ohio, then down West St by the Canal, and then on old US-40/Washington St past the Zoo, and then all the way out to the Airport, passing by a Latino district and along the old US-36 route. The 8 route also heads east from downtown and can be used to access the quaint neighborhood of Irvington. M–F 9AM–11PM, Sa 6AM–10PM, Su 7AM–7PM.   18 Nora  runs up from the Downtown loop around Capitol, Ohio, Delaware, and Maryland up Meridian St past the Childrens Museum. M–F 6AM–9:15PM, Sa 8AM–9:15PM, Su limited.   38 Lafayette Square  is another convenient tourist route, as it runs up Meridian St past the Childrens Museum from the Downtown loop, and then west on 38th past the beautiful Indianapolis Museum of Art. M–F 7AM–9PM, Sa 8AM–9PM, Su 9:30AM–7:30PM.</field>

		<field name="content">Biking    is easy due to the flat terrain. Indy offers a variety of bike paths throughout the city, including the Monon Trail and the Central Canal. Currently under expansion is The Indianapolis Cultural Trail which takes riders through downtown providing signs with Indianapolis history. This world-class bike and pedestrian path marks an interconnectivity that no other city of Indianapolis size can achieve, connecting the citys five downtown Cultural Districts, neighborhoods, and entertainment amenities, and serving as the downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. Starting in 2008, Mayor Greg Ballard announced a plan to make Indianapolis a bike-friendly city for those venturing out on open, and often busy, roads. The plan includes constructing 200 miles of additional bike lanes throughout the next 15 years, many of which are already constructed. Note that motorists in Indianapolis are not known for being aggressive but it is still novel for many of them to share major roads with cyclists. Bike lanes are clearly marked but some drivers may encroach upon them.</field>

		<field name="content">Much of the Inland Empire is laid out in a grid-like pattern, making navigation very easy. In addition, streets maintain their names as they cross city boundaries, which helps reduce confusion.  Because many Inland Empire residents commute towards Los Angeles and Orange counties for work, westbound traffic is heaviest in the morning (between 7 and 9AM) and eastbound is heaviest in the evening (between 4 and 7PM). Friday traffic can be a nightmare, especially on long weekends, as many Southern California residents flock to Las Vegas. However, some simple day-planning can help you avoid driving on freeways during rush hour and will make your experience more enjoyable.</field>

		<field name="content">As in all suburbs, it is extremely difficult to get around without a car. Rental cars are available near John Wayne Airport.  Irvine is known for its winding streets that do not follow the traditional grid pattern most urban drivers are used to. It is extremely easy to become disoriented and lost if you are unfamiliar with the area. Bring a GPS or a map if you are new to the area. In the various housing tracts, if you follow the double yellow lines it will always lead you to an exit or through fare to a major street.  Since Irvine is bounded on all sides by freeways, most of the arterial streets (which tend to be 4+ lanes in either direction) will eventually lead to a freeway, but it may be many miles before this happens.  Gas stations are unusually rare for a city this large and are not usually visible from the street. If you are in need of gas in Irvine, your best chances are to look in large shopping plazas where a gas station is usually hidden. Hiding the gas stations are a sign of upscale gentrification in this city where household incomes rank as one of the highest in the nation.  Most of the major roads in Irvine have a bike path near the shoulder. Watch out for cyclists using the bike paths.</field>

There are over 45 miles of off-road bicycle trails and 282 miles of on-road bicycle lanes provided in Irvine. It is possible to transit from north to south in Irvine via tree shaded greenbelt bike trails with only two grade level crossings of highways. Other trails lead into the nearby hills for road touring or mountain biking experiences. Some paths parallel wildlife corridors and riders can often get glimpses of some of the wildlife native to the area - ranging from birds (sparrows to hawks), to oppossums and skunks, and coyotes to mountain lions.  City of Irvine Bikeways   There are numerous bicyclist clubs in Irvine and weekend mornings are a favorite time for street touring by groups sometimes numbering in the dozens. Buses and trains carry bicycles when riders are traveling longer distances.</field>

		<field name="content">The islands "bus" is the Voyageur II.  Its one of the ferries from Grand Portage (see "Get in"), but between crossings to/from the mainland, it circumnavigates the island, from Windigo to Snug Harbor along the north side one day, then back to Windigo along the south side the next, making it useful for getting from one part of the island to another.  During the summer it makes three runs each week, fewer in early May or late September/October.  In addition to the two main ports, it can do pick-ups and drop-offs at McCargoe Cove and Belle Isle (north side, Mon/Wed/Sat), and Daisy Farm, Chippewa Harbor, and Malone Bay (south side, Tue/Thu/Sun), with fares of $40-$52 per person.  It stops at these intermediate docks only by request, and it doesnt swing by close enough to be flagged down, so book passage in advance.  The Voyageur II allows hikers to thru-hike from Windigo to Rock Harbor (or vice-versa), though a new 2008 service by the Ranger III failed and only using the VoyageurII can accomplish this.</field>

		<field name="content">It is difficult to find parking on the Cornell University campus. It is generally best to avoid driving to campus at all. Bus service onto campus from downtown and other areas of Ithaca runs  frequently during the day. One hassle-free and relatively fast parking option for visiting campus during the day is to park at the Seneca and Tioga streets parking garage in downtown Ithaca and then ride the Route 10 bus to campus. Route 10 departs from a heated bus stop located inside the parking garage every 10 minutes (7:30AM-5:00PM on weekdays, less frequently later in the evening) and the ride to Cornell takes only a few minutes.  Check TCATbus    for schedules and more information.   If you have to park on campus during the day, you will need to buy a visitor parking permit from one of the parking booths around campus, and then you can park in a spot labeled for visitor parking, which are few and far between. The parking booth attendant can give you a map showing visitor parking spots, but during a school day expect not to find anything. There are several small metered lots, including one behind Willard Straight Hall and one in the lower level of the parking garage by the football stadium, that are convenient to central campus but are often full. Larger (and rarely full) metered lots are located across from the Dairy Bar and next to Bartels Hall, but both are at least a 15 minute brisk walk to most places on central campus. After 5 PM, some of the various "tiered" parking lots are available for general parking, but be sure to read the signs, as many lots have restricted parking until 8PM or 10PM and others are restricted at all times. If you are arriving on campus by car during normal business hours, expect to spend at least 10 to 15 minutes looking for parking, and 10 to 15 minutes more walking from your parking spot to your destination, so plan to arrive on campus at least 30 minutes before you need to be somewhere. You can park for free or for cheaper off campus in Collegetown or in Cayuga Heights, but expect your walk to be 20-30 minutes to your destination if it is on central campus.</field>

		<field name="content">The parking situation at Ithaca College is also equally as poor, as over the past few years, there hasnt been enough parking for on-campus students, despite significant fee increases and discounted public transit passes. The only sanctioned visitor parking is a frequently full,  visitor lot located near the football stadium, and half a dozen spots near the main administrative building (Peggy R. Williams) for visitors to the office of admissions. Elsewhere parking is reserved based on a color coded permit system, which is strictly enforced during the week - park without a permit and your car will definitely be ticketed, and very possibly towed. On weekends, red (student) lots open up to visitor parking.  If you are visiting a specific person on campus (such as staying overnight with an on-campus student) you may be able to obtain a temporary permit from Public Safety. Availability is not guaranteed and if granted, you will be restricted to a specific lot, usually one intended for commuters. You will need your vehicle registration and proof of insurance to obtain the permit.  The following are official exceptions often made for special events: During School of Music concerts, attendee parking is permitted in lot nearest the Towers and the Whalen parking bridge (J Lot West) Patrons attending IC Theatre events may park in the lot directly behind Dillingham (Lot F) For Bombers home games, fans may park in the large lot near Butterfield stadium (Lot L) Participants at conferences or events held in the Emerson Suites may park in the Campus Center Lot (Lot U)  Many off campus students either walk or take the bus to school. TCAT service to the IC campus from downtown is plentiful, Routes 11 and 65 provide service every half hour or so during the day and every hour at night.</field>

		<field name="content">Rental car is the best way to really see the island -- and the only way to get to some remote (and scenic) sites.  Most major rental car companies have offices at the Lihue airport or nearby by shuttle bus.  Car rentals are available in a large variety of makes and models and provide travelers flexibility and freedom to explore the island.  There are numerous rental car locations right outside of the Lihue airport.  One will definitely want to use a rental car to see the island--Kauai is not a vacation spot where one stays in their resort the entire time.  Most rental car companies have restricted areas, notably Polihale beach.  Check before you go, or take the risk of paying yourself out of trouble if your rental car breaks down or gets stuck.  The red dirt that Kauai is so famous for is also highly concentrated around this area and adventurous travelers could track this stain-able substance into their rental cars</field>

The east side of the island (including Lihue and Kapa`a) has plans for a major bike path under development as of early 2005.  Parts of this path exist, but the major connections between towns are still along the major highways.  Eventually, the entire east side of the island will be connected by exclusive bikeways, making nonautomobile transportation a real option.</field>

Traffic in Kauai can be slow, particularly between  Lihue and Kapa`a.  Give yourself extra time and be patient when traveling through this area.</field>

		<field name="content">During the primary tourist season (June through August), congestion in Kennebunkport can be severe. It may take ten minutes to go from one side of downtown Kennebunkport to the other - a length of approximately three hundred meters. Off-season, this trip will take about fifteen seconds.  Outside of the Dock Square area, traffic is negligible at any time of year.  To park alongside one of the local beaches requires a permit. These can be purchased at the Kennebunk or Kennebunkport town halls or police stations. Their numbers are limited. As of 2010, they cost $10 for a day pass.  There are many places to park within a short walking distance of the beach, sometimes directly across the street, such that a permit is not required. Oftentimes these spaces are at the edge of the road. They are of dubious legality, but are tolerated.  Permits are not required between September 15th and June 15th.  Cars are not allowed on the beach between 11PM and 6AM, year round.</field>

		<field name="content">Metro Transit  (electric or diesel city buses) actually works pretty well.  The web trip planner    is straightforward and accurate, as long as your bus is on time.   Sound Transit (diesel and hybrid buses, trains) is more expensive, but has many convenient express routes    that travel South (to Tacoma), East (Redmond, Bellevue), and North (Bothell, Lynnwood).  Unlike Metro, it serves the adjoining counties as well.  Outside of the immediate Seattle-Bellevue area, many routes operate only during weekday rush hours.  Check your schedules in advance, and beware of holiday service cutbacks.  The number of the route also tells you which area of the county it serves:  Below 100 - Seattle only  100s - South King County  200s - Eastside  300s - North King County  500s - All Sound Transit routes</field>

		<field name="content">All but essential for reaching the outermost suburbs and mountains.  In addition to the interstates, major routes include SR-520, linking Seattles  University District  to  Bellevue  and  Redmond ; SR-18, a major freeway in the south county from Federal Way to  Issaquah ; and SR-509, the alternate route from the airport to Burien and  Seattle .  Traffic congestion is a major problem in the Puget Sound area on all freeways and major roads.  Avoid traveling during rush hour if you can, particularly along I-5 and across the Lake Washington bridges.  Lake Washington is crossed by two floating bridges: the I-90 bridge is free, but the SR-520 bridge charges a toll that varies by the time of day.  There are no toll booths: unless you have a transponder, your license plate will be recorded and a bill will be mailed to you automatically in a few weeks.  The long detour around the lake in either direction will usually waste far more time than youll save in toll money.</field>

		<field name="content">The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) provides bus service to King of Prussia. Many of the buses stop at the transit center adjacent to The Plaza at the King of Prussia Mall. There are two routes that connect King of Prussia with Center City Philadelphia. Bus 124 provides service to Center City Philadelphia and to Chesterbrook, with a stop at the King of Prussia Mall transit center. Bus 125 runs from Valley Forge National Historical Park and the King of Prussia directly into the Center City Philadelphia. You can catch it along Gulph Road and at the King of Prussia Mall transit center. You will arrive near the train station at 30th St and Market St; from there, you walk a few feet to the station itself and get on the eastbound subway towards the Old City and other attractions. The base fare for the 124 and 125 buses is $2.00, with an additional $1.50 zone fare for a trip into Philadelphia. The buses run every 20 min during peak hours and every hour off-peak, during the weekdays, and the trip takes around 40 min. While taking a bus may seem inconvenient, you will save time and hassle by not driving into Philadelphia yourself. Relax and let the bus driver fight the traffic. You will save even more time and money since you dont have to find a place to park your car in the city. In the reverse direction, the last bus leaves Philly (again at 30th and Market) at about 10PM, on weekdays. The 124 and 125 buses also run on Saturday and Sunday.  There are several bus routes that connect King of Prussia with nearby suburbs. Bus 92 connects the King of Prussia Mall with West Chester and Exton in Chester County Monday through Saturday. Bus 99 connects the King of Prussia Mall transit center with Norristown and Phoenixville daily. Bus 123 connects the mall with the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby daily. Bus 139 connects the King of Prussia Mall with Limerick Monday through Saturday. The base fare for all these bus routes is $2.00.  Check the SEPTA website    for additional information.</field>

		<field name="content">There is not a train station close to the King of Prussia Mall. The nearest train stations are in neighboring  Conshohocken , at Washington Street and Harry Street, and  Norristown  Transportation Center, at Schuylkill Avenue and Dekalb Street.  The Manayunk/Norristown Regional Rail Line will take you to the city center from these stations. The train ride takes about 30 min. The weekday fare is $5.50 in advance/$6.00 on board one-way and $10.75 in advance/$12.00 on board round trip. The evening/weekend fare is $4.75 in advance/$6.00 on board one-way and $9.50 in advance or on board round trip. Check SEPTAs website for timetables. The stations has a park-and-ride lot, but spaces may not be available to tourists. SEPTAs Bus 99 provides service from the Norristown Transportation Center to the King of Prussia Mall.  SEPTAs Norristown High Speed Line, which runs between Norristown Transportation Center and 69th Street Terminal, also serves the King of Prussia area, with the Gulph Mills station located at Trinity Lane and Crest Way near Gulph Road southeast of the mall. However, it would be a long and dangerous walk from the mall area. Buses 123, 124, and 125 connect the Gulph Mills station with the King of Prussia Mall.</field>

Besides the traffic on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 76, the car is quickest and most convenient way to get King of Prussia. If your coming from Center City, Philadelphia, get on I-676 (Vine St Expressway), then go I-76 towards Valley Forge. Stay on Valley Forge for about 30 minutes. After proceeding on I-76 get off at the King of Prussia Exit. If you want to go to the King of Prussia mall follow the exit signs for Mall Boulevard. If your coming from the suburbs of Philadelphia, take the Pennsylvania Turnpike towards Harrisburg, then proceed to the Valley Forge Exit.</field>

KAT operates special routes for some events, a downtown trolley service, and bus services for the University of Tennessee.   Knoxville Trolley Lines .  The trolley runs several free downtown and University routes during business hours and one "Late Line" route on Friday and Saturday nights during the University of Tennessee fall and spring semesters.

When the trail ends at Neyland Drive, pedestrians and cyclists can continue on the Neyland Greenway    to access Volunteer Landing, the stadium, and parts of the University of Tennessee campus.   A spur of the Neyland Greenway connects to the Worlds Fair Park near Neyland Stadium. Sequoyah Greenway     Technically, the Sequoyah Greenway is a gravel walking/running path located in the median of Cherokee Boulevard, the main road of one of Knoxvilles wealthiest neighborhoods.  However, cycling the broad boulevard roadway is a pleasant and reasonably safe ride for a casual or serious cyclist.  Keep right and most automobiles will have more than enough room to pass you safely. Sequoyah Hills Park    and the Tennessee River parallel much of the boulevards southern side, and the park is a wonderful place to stop for a picnic.  The northern side of the street is lined with stately homes.  Much of the Sequoyah Hills neighborhood is pedestrian friendly, so be sure to explore a few of the leafy side streets. The trail is accessible at several parking areas along the boulevard, and at the Laurel Church of Christ parking lot (use the crosswalk at the intersection of Cherokee Boulevard and Kingston Pike.)  A spur of the Third Creek Greenway leads to the Laurel Church parking lot.  Be advised that this spur is extremely steep and not in the best repair.  Bicyclists may need to dismount and small children will need lots of help. Jean Teague Greenway   :  Beginning at West Hills Elementary School and terminating at West End Church of Christ, the Jean Teague Greenway is an ideal trail for walkers and families with young children. As the trail passes through West Hills/John Bynon park, it divides to form a loop and winds around numerous athletic fields and playgrounds.  Near its midpoint, the trail crosses Winston Road near the YMCA.  Parking is available at the elementary school when school is not in session, at the park entrance on Winston Road, and at West End Church of Christ on East Walker Springs Lane.  Those wishing to continue on to the Cavet Station Greenway may do so by exiting the church parking lot and traveling westbound on East Walker Springs Lane. Cavet Station Greenway   :  The Cavet Station Greenway follows the heavily traveled Gallaher View Road from the intersection of East Walker Springs Road to Middlebrook Pike.  Although this may someday be a useful link between greenways, it is a less than idyllic experience for a recreational biker.  Nearby residents do seem to make use of it as a convenient exercise path for jogging.  A sidewalk is on the opposite side of Gallaher View, and there is a cross walk at the intersection of Walker Springs Road.  A Wal-Mart and Sams Club are located just off of the western side of Gallaher View Road. Victor Ashe Park This large and popular park is located at 4901 Bradshaw Road in North Knoxville. The park consists of 115 acres and has many ameneties. It is popular for its playground, a paved loop for walking or biking, an open space for special events, an unpaved trail, football fields, 4 soccer fields, a disc golf course.and is popular as a dog park.  Fishing is also available.  Adjacent to Badgett Field and Northwest Park.  The park is named for Victor Ashe, a former mayor of Knoxville and former United States Ambassador to Poland in the George W. Bush Administration.  Ample parking for 330 cars exists.</field>

		<field name="content">Although a car may be convenient, parking is at a premium in the summer; beware of having your car towed. Youll probably have to pay to park downtown in beach weather. The cheapest option is parking in the residential areas on the other side of Pacific Coast Highway, although you risk begrudging the residents. If you are trying to get downtown a good place to park is the district parking lot just across from Laguna Beach High School. From here you can take a short walk into town.  Lot prices in the summer range from $7 - $15.</field>

		<field name="name">trolleys</field>
		<field name="content">The trolleys run daily from 8:30AM to 11PM from the end of June through Labor Day.  There are five separate trolleys, two that go north and three that go south.  They are the South RV A, South RV B, Glens Falls, North A and North B/C.  Each trolley is clearly marked with a sign in the front and back windows.  All trolleys originate in Lake George Village and travel down Beach rd to the steamboat docks.  The base fare for all routes is $1 with children under 5 free and half price for those above the age of 60.  There is a zone change fee but that only applies when traveling from a southbound trolley to the North B/C trolley or vice versa.  All trolleys are easily spotted due to their bright red color but if you are unable to find one the docks are a good place to go because all routes begin there.  The run times for trolleys differ per route but most run every 40 to 45 minutes. South RV A This trolley travels down Route 9 to Route 149 and the Lake George RV park.  This route is once an hour.  South RV B This trolley travels down Route 9 to the Best Western/Travelodge Motels and the Wild West Ranch. Glens Falls This trolley runs from the Village all the way down to  Glens Falls .  If you are going to the Great Escape and do not wish to drive this is the trolley to take. North A This trolley travels down Canada Street and Lakeshore Road as far as the Hearthstone State Campground. North B/C This trolley travels all the way to  Bolton Landing  and  Diamond Point  along Lakeshore Road</field>

		<field name="content">All of the main attractions of Lake George are contained on Route 9 so if you choose to drive its rather easy to get around.  Parking and traffic though, can be a nightmare; especially during the Tourist season.  All parking in the village is paid parking though you may be able to find some free parking on the back roads.  There is a great deal of traffic during the daytime so be prepared to stop.  Driving is probably the worst way to get around the village and you’ll burn more gas in traffic then actually driving.</field>

		<field name="content">The Lake of the Ozarks is a winding 93 miles (150 km) long. The common indicator for determining a lake location is the mile marker. Beginning at Bagnell Dam    each mile of the lake has a marker designating how far from the dam by water the position is.  There are several areas with distinctions  North Shore referring to the first 6 miles along the North side of the lake. It includes the town of Rocky Mount and by land can be reached via Highway W in Miller County. Horseshoe Bend refers to the peninsula created by the bend in the lake along the first 17 miles of water. The area is often referred to by the main highway that runs its length "HH".  Shawnee bend refers to the bend the lake makes immediately after Horseshoe Bend. By land it is connected to Horse Shoe Bend via the Lake of the Ozarks Community Bridge (locally known as the toll bridge).  The West Side includes the Greenview, Sunrise Beach, Laurie and Gravois Mills areas. Its considered the "quiet side" of the lake. By water it includes parts of the Niangua Arm, parts of the Osage Arm, the Little Niangua arm and some would consider the Gravois arm part of the Westside. The Grand Glaize is an arm of the lake formed where the old Glaize Creek flowed into the Osage River in modern day Osage Beach. It is home to Lake of the Ozarks State Park and the ever popular Party Cove. The Gravois Arm is the Northernmost arm of the lake formed where the old Gravois Creek flowed into the Osage River near modern day Rocky Mount.</field>

		<field name="content">Online map and direction providers are usually very accurate in Lancaster County. They may be slightly confusing at times on back roads, but directions and mileage are very precise, especially along main routes.  Lancastrian drivers are generally very polite, with notable exceptions; they will be courteous as long as you return the favor.  You may pass the buggies. If you dont, locals will immediately peg you as a tourist. Keep an eye on oncoming traffic, activate your 4-way or hazard flashers for the duration of the manoeuvre, and pass quickly but safely, with sufficient distance from the horses.  Yes, horses do relieve themselves on the road. If you must dodge "road apples", please be careful!</field>

		<field name="content">When walking along the Strip you might meet Elvis...  If traveling along the Strip, walking is a reasonable option as the hotel-casinos are close to each other.  However, note that what may look to be a short walk of only a couple hotel-casinos away may be farther than you expected as the resorts often look closer than they are due to their large size.  In  most cases, hotels are connected to each other either by bridge or underground or in the case of Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay, by a complimentary rail shuttle. Be aware that during the summer, the oppressive heat during the daylight hours may make walking a very uncomfortable activity.</field>

		<field name="name">by monorail</field>
		<field name="content">The  Las Vegas Monorail , ☎ +1 702 699-8200, runs along the east side of the Strip with stops behind several of the hotels and at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It costs $5 one-way, $9 return and $15 for a one-day pass. Do the math before boarding, it could be cheaper for a small group to take a taxi. Because the monorail stops at the back entrance of the hotels, it takes a long time to wind through the maze of casinos, often taking 30 minutes to an hour to get from one point to another on the Strip - if youre in a hurry, take a taxi. The monorails carrying capacity of 4,000 people per hour is woefully insufficient to handle the evening exodus from the larger conventions which have as many as 150,000 attendees. If you are visiting with a friend from Nevada and want to ride the monorail, consider asking them to buy your fare because by showing a Nevada State ID or Clark County Work Permit Card (issued to all hotel employees) they qualify for the locals fare of $1. The discounted fare can be purchased from the customer service booths located at each station.  Due to high prices, inconvenient station locations, low passenger ridership, and the fact that it does not connect to downtown or the airport, the Monorail is widely regarded as a failure.  It has been operating under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy court since January 2010 while it tries to reorganize its finances under the protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</field>

		<field name="content">The Deuce runs along the Strip  Buses can be an inexpensive and convenient option, especially if just traveling up-and-down the Strip, or to-and-from downtown. A bus ride is a good way to recuperate during those hot summer months after a long and tiring walk on the Strip since the buses are air-conditioned.  The city bus line  Citizens Area Transit  (CAT), +1 702 228-7433, operates 49 routes throughout the valley. Most routes operate 5:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m daily, but some routes operate 24 hours per day. The fare is $2 for adults and $1 for kids and seniors for all residential routes. The Deuce, the London-style double decker bus operating the route along Las Vegas Blvd, costs $3 for adults and $1.50 for children and seniors, and the fare may be paid directly to the driver (no change given). In addition to the Deuce there is now also another bus operating along the Strip, the futuristic-looking Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). It runs from 9AM to 12.30AM and uses roughly the same stops as the Deuce, but skips three out of four Deuce stops and doesnt "park" at the bus stops. Thus it is a faster alternative than the Deuce, but you might also need to walk a longer distance to and from the bus stops. On the SDX you cant buy the ticket on board the bus, but need to use the machines at the bus stops.  If purchasing a child or senior fare, be prepared to show some form of picture ID to prove your age to the driver. During the larger conventions (such as CES, NAB, and MAGIC) the Deuce also operates on a special one way service from the Las Vegas Convention Center. This service operates only in the afternoon from the convention center to the Strip, and the bus travels southbound and services all regular stops from Circus Circus onward. Tickets must be purchased in advance from the ticket vending machines (located in front of the north and south halls). In addition, two additional ticket vending machines are located on the Strip, one at the Slots-of-fun/Circus Circus stop and one at the Showcase Mall/MGM Grand stop.  The bus drivers do not give change. However, the ticket vending machines give change and accept credit/debit cards. Transfers require payment of an additional fare.  Be aware that on the Strip, buses may stop at short intervals and may be there for a couple of minutes as passengers board and disembark. If traveling longer distances, it is often worth it to wait and catch an express bus, which has less stops and does not collect tickets or money, making it faster to walk on and off. Tickets must be purchased in advance at bus station kiosks along the strip.  A residential 24 h day pass ($5 for adults and $2 for kids and seniors) covers all routes except The Deuce, which costs $0.50 extra, and an "all-access pass" for $7 covers all routes on the system. If you will be staying for a long period of time (at least 8 days for adults or 4 for children and seniors) and plan to buy an all access pass, a more economic option is to purchase a 30-day bus pass. These can be purchased from either of the two bus terminals (both can be reached by riding the Deuce to Downtown terminal, or to the South Strip Terminal), or from any ticket vending machine. Yet another alternative is the three day (72 h) all access pass that costs $20 and lets you ride on all buses including the Deuce and SDX.  It is important to note however, that if you would like to purchase a child or senior fare pass, you will need to do so from the customer service agent at the terminals. These passes are valid for 30 days following the first use and can be used on all routes.  If the buses are crowded, a good way to avoid waiting for the next bus is to walk one block east from the Strip and use route 108 Paradise Road or walk one block west to Industrial Road and use route 105, Martin L King Blvd and Koval, which runs parallel to the Strip route.</field>

		<field name="name">by taxi</field>
		<field name="content">One of the easiest ways to get around is by taxi.  It is relatively cheap to go from hotel to hotel, but be aware that since traffic is often so congested on the strip, taking a taxi often isnt much faster than walking. Many taxis will cut off the strip to use a parallel road—this is often faster but can double your taxi fare. The taxi driver is required to use the meter and to take the shortest route to your destination. There is a surcharge for rides originating at the airport, but not for extra passengers. Taxi lines (queues) are typically found at the front of hotels.  All taxis require an address for pickup and drop off. It is illegal in Las Vegas for taxis to pick up or drop off passengers on the street, especially on the Strip. It is customary to tip the hotel taxi dispatcher $1 and tip the taxi driver 15% of the meter, and about $1 per piece of luggage.  If you are traveling with a large group, consider hiring a limousine, as you will often forgo a wait and the price per person may even be lower than that using a taxicab.  Limousines usually queue in front of the taxicab line and can be approached directly.</field>

		<field name="content">If you mostly plan to hang around one casino and your time in Vegas is short, you might want to forego a rental car altogether and just take taxis. On the other hand, taxi fares add up quickly, and with car rental so cheap, anyone staying a few days or longer would be better suited with the flexibility of a car. Some of the best sights are located just outside of Las Vegas and require that you drive to those destinations.  If you need to or might go farther (e.g., out of state), ensure your rental agreement allows it and sharing of driving duties.  The base rental price for a car at McCarran International Airport is quite competitive with other major cities.  Unfortunately, agencies at the airport must levy very large fees (e.g., for airport improvements) and taxes on those base prices. These can increase the modest weekly cost of a compact or intermediate size car by nearly 60 percent.    All airport rental agencies share a single off-airport facility served by frequent shuttle buses.  Add at least 30 minutes to your schedule to pick up and/or drop off your vehicle...to ensure you wont be late for meetings or departure flights.    There are numerous car rental offices on the Strip...making it very easy to rent a car from your hotel for a day trip.  Remember to rent ahead of time as it can be busy during weekends and during major conventions.  Check to see if those off-airport sites must also charge the above fees and taxes.</field>

		<field name="content">Traffic on the Strip on a weekend night  Driving Las Vegas Boulevard (the "Strip"), especially on weekends, is an exercise in frustration. Due to extremely severe gridlock, you could easily spend an hour (or more) sitting in traffic on the Strip just to travel a couple of miles. The Strips most critically congested section is the 1.7-mile-long portion between Spring Mountain Road/Sands Avenue to the north and Tropicana Avenue to the south, which happens to be where almost all of the major hotel-casinos are located.  Do what the locals do and avoid driving long distances on the Strip altogether. Instead take I-15, which parallels the Strip, and get off at the exit nearest your hotel and park there. Frank Sinatra Drive (which dead ends into Industrial Road) lies just west of the Strip, runs behind the casinos, and provides another option. Koval Lane and Paradise Road provide similar access on the eastern side of the Strip.  If you need to do an east or west traverse of the northern half of the Strip and I-15, consider using the Desert Inn Road superarterial, which was built specifically to provide a fast grade-separated route for east-west traffic.  Virtually all major casinos on the Strip, and downtown, offer free parking and many also offer valet parking for an additional charge. On Friday and Saturday nights, the self-parking lots fill up fast; consider splurging on the valet to avoid cumbersome delays and endless circling around.</field>

Buses run every 35 minutes during business hours, every 70 minutes Saturdays and Evenings, and every 60 minutes on Sundays. These unorthodox schedules were adopted not out of budget concerns, but because the previous "30/60 minute" schedule didnt fit well with longer routes, and often led to buses being off schedule. As a result of the change, buses are now more reliably on time. Buses do not run after 11pm or before 5am (or 7am on weekends). Fare costs $1. If paying fare for a bus heading inbound / downtown, you can request a transfer and board a bus leaving the transit center for free.</field>

		<field name="content">Lexingtons roads form a wheel-and-spokes pattern: New Circle Road forms a circle around the inner city, and arterial roads radiate from downtown. New Circle Road, an early experiment in urban circumferential expressways, was first built before current zoning rules, so that about 1/4 of it is developed with commercial usage, while the rest is 55-mph freeway with on/off ramps. The radial roads are mostly named after the neighboring towns they lead to (e.g. Nicholasville, Richmond, Winchester, etc.), although as you approach downtown they take on a different name (e.g. Limestone, Main, etc.). Directions in Lexington will frequently start with "Take New Circle to ____ Road (one of the arterials), then turn north/south..."  Man o War Boulevard forms a half-circle further outside from New Circle Road; however its lower speed limit and abundance of traffic lights make it less ideal for circling the city.</field>

You can call Capitol Cab at (501) 570-9999.  If youre renting a car:  I-630 runs from east/west from downtown to the edge of west Little Rock; for most attractions you wont go too far north or too far south of 630.

		<field name="name">public transportation or car?</field>
		<field name="content">Public transportation in L.A., as in many western American cities, leaves something to be desired. Although the Los Angeles area has numerous bus routes and several transit agencies, and a fairly new subway and elevated network to boot, this is still not adequate enough considering the regions population and size. For instance, a few bus routes at best may have service every 15 or 20 minutes, while others (especially away from the main tourist areas) may have service every 30 to 90 minutes. Also keep in mind there is not a bus line to reach every nook and cranny, and as such, it is not uncommon to find yourself walking up to a mile or more to your destination after youve gotten off the bus at the closest stop. And because there are numerous bus transit agencies in the L.A. area, you may find yourself paying additional money when you get off one transit agencys bus and board another transit agencys bus to continue your journey. Keep in mind, some bus routes will end service in the early evening, so you should plan your trip accordingly to make sure you are not stranded while on an outing, thus subjecting yourself to an expensive taxi ride back to your hotel -which, depending on how far away you are, may end up costing roughly the same amount as if you had rented a car for the day in the first place.   Los Angeles also has a medium-sized, and expanding, subway/light rail system to help speed up journeys around the city. If you plan to be staying near a Metro Rail station in the outlying areas, this may suffice as the rail network will take you to some of the tourist areas such as Hollywood, Universal Studios, Chinatown, and Long Beach. However, those who plan to stay for multiple days in the city, and will be staying or visiting outlying areas, and would otherwise have to take multiple buses during their visit, are strongly advised to rent a car if the budget allows.    For visitors who will routinely be traveling only a couple of miles or so, and willing to plan for much longer trips, and who will stay just a few days, and not minding the generally 20-60 minute bus wait, then they may find that the L.A. public transportation system can be sufficient enough. Basically, if you intend to travel in the areas of the West Side, downtown L.A., Beverly Hills, and Hollywood, and primarily travel during weekdays, then public transportation may reasonably accommodate your needs.   Metro Rapid buses come more frequently and make fewer stops than local buses and should be used when possible. Remember that many cities in the metro area (including Santa Monica, Culver City, Long Beach, Santa Clarita, and Ontario to name a few) operate their own bus agencies, independent of the Metro, thus charging different fares.  If you choose to rent a car, you will get a look at the infamous and large L.A.-area freeway system and a taste of the notorious traffic jams. However, this will still be more convenient than bus travel for long or multiple destination trips.</field>

		<field name="content">Los Angeles County Metro Rail Map   The Los Angeles areas  Metro Rail  subway/elevated light rail system opened its first line in the 1990s and has been expanding its system over the past 20 years or so. Many neighborhoods and sightseeing destinations can be reached using the Metro, including downtown, Koreatown, Los Feliz, Hollywood, North Hollywood, Chinatown, Pasadena, and Long Beach. For these areas public transportation is preferable, when possible, to the gridlock that often occurs on Los Angeles area freeways and streets.  A single-trip fare valid on one line in one direction costs $1.50 (no transfers) and can be purchased from ticket vending machines located in the stations. Alternatively, a day pass (valid until 3am the next day) costs $5, a weekly pass (running Sunday to Saturday) costs $20, and a monthly pass costs $75. Passes allow unlimited access on Metro bus and rail lines. Day passes can be purchased through ticket vending machines in stations (on buses, day passes can be purchased only using a reusable TAP card), and weekly and monthly passes on TAP cards can be obtained online or at Metro Customer Centers (the main one is at Union Station). Metro Rail and Metro Bus services can be used with the passes (a few express bus routes require payment of additional fare except for pass users). Route maps are available online and in stations.  Metro fare payment works on a proof-of-payment system. There are turnstiles in the subway stations and some light rail stations. Passengers using a TAP card must tap the turnstile to have a valid fare. Passengers using paper one-day passes can walk through the turnstiles as they are currently unlocked, but there are plans to lock at least some of the stations. However, tickets or passes must be purchased before entering boarding zones; there, Metro police randomly check for valid tickets on the trains or platforms, even if people did not board any train. The penalty for not being able to show a valid ticket is $250 and up to 48 hours of community service.  Unlike many cities whose local train systems allow free transfers between rail lines when the lines converge, trips that involve multiple lines or transfers in L.A. require separate tickets for each line. A better option will simply be to purchase a day, weekly, or monthly pass for travel on all the lines. Passes can be more cost effective than several single-ride tickets.  Metro Rail/Transitway Lines:  Red Line, a subway that runs from  Downtown  (Union Station) to the  Hollywood  area, then to  North Hollywood  in the  San Fernando Valley . This route shares track with the Purple Line for about half of its length; when boarding a subway train, check its destination signs to make sure you are on the right train. Station display signs should also provide information about the destination of the train you are boarding. Trains run on average every 12 minutes daytime, becoming less frequent in the evening.  Purple Line, a subway that runs from  Downtown  (Union Station) to Koreatown. This route shares track with the Red Line for most of its length; when boarding a subway train, check its destination signs to make sure you are on the right train. Note that the Purple Line trains outside of rush hour are only two cars in length and will not fill the length of the station. There are tunnel signs to help guide you to where the train will stop.  Blue Line, a light rail line that runs from Downtown (7th Street/Metro Center Station) through South Los Angeles to  Long Beach .  Serves L.A. Live and the Watts Towers.  Expo Line, a light rail line that runs from Downtown (7th St/Metro Center) through South Los Angeles to USC and the museums of Exposition Park and west to  Culver City .  Will extend to Santa Monica in 2015.  Gold Line, a light rail line that runs from  East LA  through Chinatown and Northeast Los Angeles to  Pasadena .  Serves Union Station.  Green Line, a light rail line that runs from the South Bay (near LAX) east to the city of  Norwalk  along Interstate 105.  Orange Line, a transitway across the San Fernando Valley from North Hollywood to Warner Center (Woodland Hills), using sleek articulated "bus-trains" on rubber tires.  Silver Line, a transitway from El Monte to Artesia using "bus-trains" on rubber tires. A surchage is to be paid on this route. must be purchased for this route.  Note that Metro operating hours and timetables vary fom one line to another.  There is currently no direct rail connection between Downtown Los Angeles and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), but a free shuttle from the Metro Green Line Aviation/LAX Station to terminals is available. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) operates the much more convenient and direct  LAX FlyAway shuttle  every 30 minutes between Union Station and airport terminals.  Distinct from Metro is the  Metrolink  commuter rail system, centered at Union Station. This commuter rail system reaches as far as  Ventura ,  Lancaster ,  San Bernardino , and  Oceanside  (northern San Diego County) but runs limited night and weekend service. Metrolink does not accept Metro passes and requires the purchase of separate tickets. Like Metro, Metrolink uses the honor system, where no barriers are required to enter the system, but frequent random inspections ensure that every passenger has a valid ticket or pays $250 fine with 48 hours community service. Metrolink tickets are honored as a day pass on Metro Rail and Metro buses. Metrolink offers the Weekend Day Pass for $10 and the pass is good for unlimited travel on Metrolink trains for either Saturday or Sunday and can be used for participating connecting transit including the Metro Rail in Los Angeles and various bus systems throughout Southern California.</field>

		<field name="content">The main bus system in Los Angeles is operated by  Metro  (+1 800 COMMUTE, or +1 800 266-6883). Many Angelenos without a car use the bus as their primary mode of transportation. The preponderance of frequent bus service is along major north-south and east-west corridors radiating to the south and west of Downtown Los Angeles.   Rapid buses have fewer stops than local service and cut through the traffic well. Check the schedules in advance as many routes change and have reduced frequency in the late hours. Fares are currently $1.50 per ride (no transfers), $5 for a day pass, and $20 for a weekly pass. Day passes can be purchased from any Metro Rail station or bus operator; weekly passes can be purchased in selected stores in the county, online, and at Metro Customer Centers. Daily, weekly, and monthly passes can be used on both Metro Rail and Metro Bus. From a Metro Bus, a transfer to a municipal line is $0.35 and is good for many non-Metro bus systems which are listed on the transfer ticket that a bus operator will give you if you pay cash for the fare.  Neighboring cities often operate their own bus systems with different fares. Santa Monicas  Big Blue Bus  system provides service in that city as well as linking Santa Monica with Westside L.A. districts such as Brentwood, Westwood, and Venice Beach, and also downtown L.A. and LAX. The  Culver CityBus  operates buses in and around Culver City.  Areas of the foothills and San Gabriel Valley east of El Monte are served by  Foothill Transit .  Montebello Bus Lines  operates service in Montebello, Pico Rivera, Whittier, East LA, and surrounding communities. And  Long Beach Transit  provides service to Long Beach.  Note: Unlike many American cities that have one or perhaps two transit agencies with compatible fares, the L.A. region has several transit agencies and their fares structures are not interchangeable with each other. You will have to pay additional money if youre switching buses to a different transit agency. Several bus agencies have agreements and will honor additional fare paid for bus transfers from other agencies.</field>

		<field name="content">The Four-Level Interchange in Downtown Los Angeles  Los Angeles is notorious for its traffic conditions, and its freeway system can get extremely clogged at times. Still, automobile travel is the easiest way to see parts of the region. Many major car rental companies are located at LAX.   Many natural areas surrounding the LA metropolitan area can be reached only by car. See the article about  Driving in Los Angeles County  for more information. If you are going to be driving, make sure that you have access to extensive street and freeway maps or a GPS navigation system or you may get lost on the spaghetti map of freeways.  The freeways can be confusing for visitors. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with your chosen route prior to setting out on your trip and pay attention to traffic and road signs. "Carpool Only" lanes may be entered with two or more occupants in a vehicle. On portions of the 10 and 110 freeways, these lanes are toll lanes but allow single drivers and require a Fast Track Transponder to enter.  You have been warned.  Listening to a radio station is helpful for any long trip through LA since most stations regularly disseminate traffic information during the daylight hours. KNX 1070 AM and KFWB 980 AM are the most frequent and cover the metropolitan area, including Orange and Ventura counties and the Inland Empire.   Although LAs traffic jams are legendary, the freeway grid provides for an effective movement of traffic and a variety of alternatives. Be sure to have an alternative route planned out in advance; many freeways run parallel to one another and serve as viable alternatives, especially in long-distance trips. If possible, use a passenger as your navigator. You may also check  SigAlert  or  TrafficReport  for current traffic information before your trip.  As for driving on the street grid, most cities in the Greater Los Angeles Area (also called Southland) have well-maintained streets, but streets within the city of Los Angeles itself tend to have a lot of cracks and potholes (the city government spends about half of its annual budget on law enforcement, which leaves little for street maintenance).  Wilshire Boulevard is particularly notorious for extremely bumpy conditions and requires extreme caution to avoid destroying the suspension of ones vehicle. The city government has installed sensor loops on most major streets and publishes real-time traffic speed maps  online .  Also, while many other California cities have dedicated left-turn traffic lights at major intersections, allowing for so-called "protected" left turns, most Los Angeles intersections do not have them. They operate under the rule where you must yield to opposing traffic, and turn only when it is safe. Some Los Angeles streets are so congested that it is impossible to turn until the traffic light reaches the yellow (caution) phase.   Therefore, it is customary in Los Angeles for as many as two or three vehicles to creep into the middle of such intersections in order to turn against opposing traffic on a yellow light. If you are a first-time visitor, you may find yourself being honked at by other drivers until you become accustomed to this.    Driving around downtown is especially frustrating to deal with. Even when there are not a large number of vehicles present, drivers still tend to go slower in this area because of the numerous turns and exits.  Another frustration of driving in downtown Los Angeles is the very expensive cost of parking there.  Many downtown hotels and many hotels outside of downtown (such as in high-density areas like LAX, Hollywood and Century City) have parking garages, but will charge you exorbitant daily parking fees.  Even worse, they may have only valet parking, meaning you will be expected to also tip the valet.  If you plan to bring or rent a car to drive around Los Angeles, consider looking for hotels that have free parking or at least reasonable fees for self-parking garages.    Many Los Angeles intersections have red light enforcement cameras, linked to sensor loops which are energized about a third of a second after the traffic light turns red. You will know the camera activated when it flashes its strobe light at you to obtain a clear view of your face (which is required along with a picture of the license plate to issue a ticket under California law). These intersections are sometimes marked in advance by signs and should be approached carefully to avoid a fine.</field>

		<field name="content">Taxis can be expensive. You cannot flag them down on the street, but can call one of the taxi companies to send a cab to pick you up. You may have to wait awhile for a taxi to get to you depending on where you are. Remember, this city generally experiences a lot of traffic and is very spread out. Thus the overwhelming majority of citizens have their own vehicles; hence, cabs are expensive and less involved in the movement of people than in cities like New York, Chicago, or Washington, DC.</field>

		<field name="name">by motorcycle</field>
		<field name="content">An often overlooked alternative which deals well with Los Angeles lackluster public transportation and frustrating traffic conditions is to travel by motorcycle. Rentals range from around $70 for a basic bike up to $300 a day for high-performance sport bikes, with plenty of range and options between. This option garners a higher per-day rental price than a car, with obviously diminished cargo space. However, a motorcycles significant increase in fuel economy combined with the citys high gas prices, and ease of parking in a notoriously difficult-to-park-in city may be appealing to the adventurous rider. A quick web search will reveal numerous rental agencies, including  Eagle Rider ,  Cheap Motorcycle Rental , and others. California riders must have a class M1 license.   Of course, riding a motorcycle should be done by those who are experienced as it is not for the faint of heart. But it may afford the rider a small advantage in terms of travel time. In most states in America, it is illegal to "split lanes" -riding between two adjacent lanes through slow or stopped traffic to get ahead of other vehicles- as a motorcycle rider is still required to follow virtually all rules and guidelines as if it were a car. Although lane splitting is illegal in most states, it is legal in California if undertaken at speeds under 45 mph. Motorcycles with engines less than 250cc, or if incapable of maintaining speeds exceeding 60mph, are not permitted on freeways. Foreign travelers not familiar with the United States may notice motorcycles tend to be comparatively large, heavy, and fast and extreme caution should be exercised.   The canyon roads of Malibu, Topanga, and the San Gabriel mountains are frequented by motorsports enthusiasts year-round due to their extreme "twistiness" and contain celebrated hangouts such as Neptunes Net (on the Pacific Coast Highway), the Rock Store (on Mulholland in Malibu Canyon), and others. Bikers visiting on the weekend will find good company, cold beer, and excellent riding there. The drinking age is 21, and it is enforced.</field>

		<field name="content">Louisvilles public transit service,  TARC , operates bus lines in all parts of Louisville Metro (Jefferson County). Fares are $1.50 for adults (75 cents for children between 6 and 17) which includes two transfers within two hours. Tickets can be purchased at some banks and government offices but this will not really save you much money unless you are going to be staying in the city and getting around by bus for at least two weeks. Buses generally run from about 6AM-10PM, some later on weekends, but it is a good idea to check the schedule for each specific route. Timetables are only posted at major stops. The buses are also rather impractical in the suburbs, as they are infrequent and the stops are far apart.</field>

		<field name="content">Car rental services are available at the airport. Louisville is encircled by two beltways, I-264 (officially the Henry Watterson Expressway and locally known as "the Watterson") and I-265 (the Gene Snyder Freeway, or unofficially "the Snyder"). Traffic is generally moderate except at peak hours on I-264 and in downtown. In particular, try to avoid  "Spaghetti Junction" , the downtown freeway interchange, between four-thirty and seven on weekdays.  The city streets are laid out in a grid pattern in downtown and a wheel-and-spoke system farther out. Frequently, the streets are named after outlying towns they eventually reach (Shelbyville Road, Bardstown Road, Taylorsville Road, etc.) Some of the urban neighborhoods, notably Germantown, Portland, and the neighborhoods surrounding Cherokee Park, can be confusing for non-locals. Fortunately most neighborhoods are quite safe and passers-by will be more than happy to give you directions.</field>

		<field name="content">Bicycling is becoming an increasingly effective way to get around Louisville.  Although Louisvilles bike program    is in its infancy (born at the 2005 Louisville Bike Summit), developments are occuring rapidly, and there are significant improvements on the immediate horizon.  In fact, former long-time mayor and current Kentucky lieutenant governor Jerry Abramson is an active cyclist.  Bike lanes are being added on city streets, especially in and around Downtown which is already the most bike-friendly area of the city.  Every TARC bus in the city is equipped with bike racks, making bicycling a viable option for long-distance trips and trips along major arterial corridors.  If you plan your transit route in advance, it is easy to get anywhere in the city using just your bicycle and public transit.  Metro Government is also installing more bike racks every day, making it easy to park your bike at your destination.</field>

		<field name="content">Lubbock is developed along a large scale grid. North-south streets are labeled A-Z Downtown and progress to city and state names moving west. East-west streets are numbered from 1 to 150 or so. Streets north of Downtown follow the names of colleges and universities, while those east of Downtown are flowers and trees. Block ranges, house numbering and street names are consistent throughout the city and most follow alphabetical order. All major roadways are 1 mi (1.6 km) from each other in either direction and are uniformly straight.   The intrastate I-27, which connects  Amarillo  and Lubbock, terminates south of the TX SR 289 interchange.   The interchange of 66th St., US 84 and I-27 was once the site of a notorious intersection called The Circle. Avenues A, H, Q, Tahoka Rd. and Slaton Rd. converged in a three lane vaulted hub a half-mile in diameter. Avenues Q A were not realigned after the I-27 project covered most of Avenue H. The remaining intersection is still very tricky at the northeast corner.   TX SR 289, often called The Loop or 289 by locals, can be congested along its southwest portion during business hours.   Construction of the Marsha Sharp Freeway will cause severe disruptions near Texas Tech University and Downtown.</field>

		<field name="content">The citys public transit authority,  Citibus , operates fixed bus routes throughout the city. The system relies on a pulse-based schedule which originates at the Downtown Transfer Plaza. A one-way trip is $1.50, and a day pass is $3. The drivers operate electronic fare boxes and do not carry change. Most routes pass through Texas Tech University and the two medical centers. The city is quite large so using the transit may be inconvenient.</field>

Plan your trip before calling, as the dispatchers are often extremely busy. It is best to offer your mobile phone number when arranging a pick-up. Drivers will phone you when they are a few blocks away. Yellow Cab also carries several thousand contract passengers everyday so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes in the late afternoon or early morning. 806 765-7777, Available 24 Hours/day.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving is perhaps the most convenient way to get around Lynchburg. Apart from the Downtown area, most of the city is not very friendly to pedestrian traffic.  The Lynchburg Expressway connects most of the major roadways in Lynchburg, intersecting and merging with the business segments of U.S. 29, U.S. 460, and U.S. 501.  The city limits are very clearly marked and are drawn in such a way that some places within the city are inaccessible without first traveling outside the city. For instance, the planned community at Wyndhurst can only be accessed via Enterprise Dr, which terminates in two different counties.  Also note that a few major roads change names with no clear indication as to where these changes take place. For examples, Lakeside Dr becomes Forest Rd, Fort Ave becomes Timberlake Rd, and Memorial Ave becomes Fifth St.  Several lots and limited on-street parking are available in Downtown Lynchburg. Two lots, the Midtown and Clay Street Parking Decks, are metered, operating on the mPARK system used in several other cities in the United States and abroad.  During the afternoon rush hour (4:45PM - 5:45PM), Candlers Mountain Rd, Wards Rd, and Timberlake Rd experience significantly increased traffic.</field>

		<field name="content">Honoapiilani Highway (Route 30) is the road to Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Kapalua; it runs between West Maui and Wailuku around majestic cliffs and along white sand beaches.  Hana Highway (Routes 36 and 360), the "road to Hana," traces Mauis north coast from Kahului to the village of Hana on the eastern shore.  Winding along steep, forested mountainsides, in many places the road narrows to only a single lane.  Although the road to Hana is only 56 miles (90 km) long, it turns and winds so continuously that the whole journey can take up to three hours one-way, especially if there is traffic. However, if you leave early in the morning, the trip can take as little as 90 minutes.  Haleakala Highway (Routes 37, 377, and 378) is the road that leads to Pukalani and Makawao in upcountry Maui and takes you to the summit of Haleakala.  Be aware that most locals refer to the roads not by number but by name, and will likely not understand if you ask for a road by number. For example you would never hear someone refer to Piilani highway as "route 31" or "highway 31."</field>

		<field name="content">Miamis public transit system is the most diverse and extensive of any locality in Florida. In short, if travel time is not a priority, it is possible to travel to all commercial areas and major attractions within Miami without a car.  Miamis bus system covers the entire county and connects to bus lines serving Broward County and the Greater Fort Lauderdale area. Recent developments have made the bus system more reliable than in the past. Even with the changes, and because of high local traffic, buses tend to have a hard time remaining on schedule. However, buses run often enough through each route so as not to be a nuisance. Many of the major bus routes operate 24 hours a day, seven days week, including the Route S bus, which connects downtown Miami to all of Miami Beach, terminating at Avenutra Mall in north Miami-Dade.  The Metrorail is a single-line elevated rail system serving Miami and surrounding cities, running 22.4nbsp;mi with 22 stations. It connects many areas of tourist interest, including downtown Miami, Dadeland Mall, Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Lowe Art Museum, Miami Museum of Science, Village at Merrick Park and many other nearby shopping areas. Coconut Grove and downtown  Coral Gables  can be reached via short shuttle bus from various stations. Metrorail operates between roughly 5AM and midnight, with a bus serving all Metrorail stations operating in the overnight hours, effectively providing 24-hour service.  Recently, state and federal funding has allowed for planned expansions to the Metrorail to take better shape. A connection to Miami International Airport started construction in late 2009, and is expected to be fully operational by Spring 2012. Along with this project, a northern expansion dubbed the Orange Line  was given more than $4.3 billion in funding in the 2009 Federal "Stimulus Package" and is expected to be opened as early as 2014. This new line will connect the Metrorail line with Dolphins Stadium, Miami-Dade College, and the suburbs of Miami Gardens and Opa-locka. There have also been discussions among elected leaders for a light rail line to Miami Beach, as well as a Miami Streetcar connecting Downtown Miami to the Media and Entertainment District in Midtown Miami, though no formal plans have been proposed or approved for funding.  Fare for a single trip on both Metrorail and Metrobus is $2 per ride ($1 for persons with disabilities or on Medicare). Day, weekly, and monthly pass are available. In early 2010, Miami-Dade Transit implemented a fare card system known as EASY Card. Though exact change/cash is still accepted on all Metrobus routes, an EASY Card is required for riding the Metrorail, and for utilizing the free transfers offered between an unlimited number of bus routes, and a single Metrorail ride. Currently, the fare card software does not allow passbacks. Any remaining transit tokens you may have can no longer be exchanged for EASY Card credit, and are not accepted as fare. Additional information on fares, routes and schedules can be found at   , or by calling +1 305 770-3131.  Downtown Miami is served by a free elevated people mover system known as Metromover, which connects to Metrorail at two stations at Government Center in the central business district and at Brickell Station in Brickell. Metromover is free of charge and is the most efficient way to move around Downtown Miami. It is a great way to take a rest when walking around downtown, and a great time to take pictures of the skyscrapers and growing Miami skyline from above.   South Florida’s Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) , or by calling +1 800 tri-rail. There are frequent tri rails (at least one per an hour) to one of the four major destinations, Broward County, Miami-Dade County, Palm Beach County and South Florida Education Center (SFEC)/ Davie Campus Transit Routes. Each of these four destinations have many different stops. Be sure to check the website for each stop and a schedule. There are employer discount programs on the website as well as fares.</field>

		<field name="name">by taxi</field>
		<field name="content">Taxis are generally expensive with a surcharge of $2.50 for the pick-up and an additional $0.40 for each sixth of a mile traveled. Almost all cab companies in the area have pre-determined rates for travel into the barrier islands of Miami Beach and other beach and nightclub communities popular with tourists which can range from $30–$60 depending on arrival location. For example, South Beach may be the most expensive while a residential neighborhood in Miami Beach may be the cheapest. The charge is the same regardless of pick-up location on the mainland. All taxis are fitted with maps of the barrier islands which state the cost per location. The same applies for passengers leaving the islands onto the mainland, though normal rates apply for person traveling by taxi within the islands or within the mainland.  Service is available throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties regardless of pick-up location. The normal service charges apply for these four counties, but it is wise to ask for a pre-determined price beforehand if leaving the county as this will in most cases turn out to be cheaper and most drivers are willing to negotiate when leaving the county. If you wish to be taxied to a location outside of those four counties, you must negotiate a price and advise the cab company first. Drivers may refuse to drive outside of the metropolitan area if they are not advised to do so beforehand.  Usually you will have to call a cab company and request a pick-up. Taxis operated by the major companies are not normally allowed to pick up passengers at random locations for safety and legal reasons except at MIA, the Port of Miami and train stations. Some individual taxi drivers will not follow this rule, however. You can try hailing a taxi in the street. A significant and notable exception to this rule is the South Beach section of Miami Beach. For all intents and purposes, taxis can be flagged from the street on the island in a very similar way to what one might expect in New York City. This trend has begun spreading into the downtown area of Miami, but is primarily due to the increased redevelopment and foot traffic downtown, and should not be relied upon if you have a schedule to keep.  All taxi drivers must have a valid license to operate. It is uncommon to hear of crimes involving unlicensed taxis anywhere in the metropolitan area since Dade County keeps track of all taxi activity in and around Miami and cooperates with other counties in getting this information. If you enter a cab and do not see a valid license placed in front of the passengers seat, you should not enter the taxi and instead call another cab company regardless of what the driver says. If you willingly enter a taxi without a license or with an expired license and there is an incident or accident, it is possible that you may not be able to hold the driver accountable by law. When entering a cab you should make note of the drivers name, license number and cab number if any problems arise during the trip. This information should be easily found inside the taxi.It may be able to help you identify the cab driver to the police or the cab company.</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Unless you plan to stay downtown or in a single location elsewhere, you will find that a car is very convenient in Miami, and car rentals are cheap in comparison to other major US cities.  You can find cheap car rentals off terminal from the Miami Airport from such companies as E-Z Rent-A-Car    and Ace Rent A Car. The major car rental companies can be found in terminal be can be often more expensive for the same service and vehicles.  Surface roads in Miami are usually easy to navigate. The areas roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. The two main axis roads are Miami Avenue (running north to south) and Flagler Street (running east to west). These two roads intersect in downtown Miami, the countys symbolic center. All avenues run north to south, while all streets run east to west.  For example, the address, "9500 NW 30th Street" would be at the intersection of NW 30th Street (to the west of Miami Avenue, and 30 blocks north of Flagler Street) and NW 95th Avenue (north of Flagler Street, and 95 blocks west of Miami Avenue). Most roads in Miami conform to this nomenclature, but due to the more than 30 municipalities within Miami-Dade County, there are a few exceptions to be aware of. Examples include Coral Gables, the Coconut Grove section of Miami (city proper), Miami Lakes, and Hialeah.  Hialeah is particularly notorious since it uses its own grid system, in addition to the overall county system. For example, NW 103rd Street is also marked as E 49th Street, or W 49th Street in Hialeah.  Note that if you cross into Broward County, the roads will be numbered based on their distance from the Fort Lauderdale city center, which is generally the same going east-west but will be very different going north-south. Most of the municipalities in Broward County use their own limited grid systems as well.  Some street names also change at the county line. The coastline highway, A1A, is known as "Collins Avenue" in Miami, but becomes "Ocean Drive" in Broward. Likewise, "Red Road" in Miami becomes "Flamingo Road" in Broward.  Miami has four primary expressways. In addition to I-95 and Florida’s Turnpike, there is state highway 836 (also known as the Dolphin Expressway) and state highway 826 (also known as the Palmetto Expressway). The Dolphin Expressway runs west from downtown Miami along the edge of Miami International Airport. The Palmetto Expressway and Floridas Turnpike form "F"-shaped loops around the city. The Turnpike continues north, roughly parallel to I-95, and will take you to Orlando if you keep driving. I-95, the Palmetto and the Turnpike intersect at a junction in North Miami called the Golden Glades. You may find driving in the Glades challenging, especially if you have little experience driving in it.  New visitors to Miami should be aware that the areas drivers are particularly aggressive. AutoVantage.coms Road Rage Survey has rated Miami drivers the rudest in the country for a third year in a row   . This shouldnt discourage anyone from using the roadways, but a passive approach to Miami driving can save you from an unwanted exchange with another driver, or even worse an accident. Posted speed limits are ignored by most drivers, especially on larger roads with lower speed limits. Two examples are I-95 and state road 826 (The Palmetto Expressway). The eastern portion of state road 836 (The Dolphin Expressway) between Miami International Airport and downtown Miami handles traffic that exceeds its capacity, and contains several left-hand exits, including the eastbound off-ramp to Lejuene Road (NW 42nd Avenue), which is the posted route, and the quickest route to Miami International Airport.</field>

		<field name="content">Miami Beach has become more bicycle friendly in recent years with the addition of new bike paths and bike lanes, although not as comprehensive as other major cities. Notable additions to the biking and pedestrian infrastructure include the paved "Beach Walk" which runs parallel to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue and is directly on the beach, plus the new South Point Park along the bay. In Miami Beach and South Beach riding is permitted on sidewalks, which luckily are wider than average.   That said, it doesnt stop many people from trying to utilize bicycles (including locals) to get around town.  Pedestrians and drivers tend to be tolerant of bikers and willing to share the right of way. However, be prepared to slow down and go on foot, particularly on the congested streets closer to the beach. Absent heavy auto traffic, South Beach is biking bliss.  There are better attempts at bike-friendliness in the South Beach district, where most of the bike rental shops are located. Lummus Park and Lincoln Road Mall are great for bikers, and have plenty of bike racks throughout; meanwhile, if you are trying to go north or south, go a few blocks west and take one of the roads less traveled. Meridian Ave is a good choice: plenty of interesting Miami-style houses to see and a local park. If you didnt bring your own bike, bike rentals will run about $8/hour or $30/day (or 24-hour time period).

Day passes are $6 and can be purchased  online , at a Metro Transit Store, from a bus driver, or a ticket machine at any light rail station. 7-day ($22) and 31-day ($59-$113.50) passes must be loaded on a  Go-To card , which can be purchased online, at a Metro Transit Store, or participating Metro Transit sales outlets. Stored value passes can be loaded on a Go-To card in increments of $10 (up to $400), and come with a 10% bonus on each purchase (e.g. a $10 purchase would give you $11 in fare value, $20 would give you $22, and so forth). Once in possession of a Go-To card, reloading it with new unlimited ride passes or stored value is easy and can be done online, at Metro Transit stores and outlets, or at light rail ticket machines.</field>

		<field name="content">The northern head of the LRT is a station opened in November 2009 at 5th Street and 3rd Avenue North, next to the Minnesota Twins (baseball) new home of Target Field. The Target Field station is also the southern terminus of the Northstar Line. Before the extension of the LRT to Target Field, the northern head was farther south in the downtown area, on Hennepin Avenue and South 5th Street near the Warehouse District and the Target Center. Along Hennepin next to the LRT station are bus stops for Route 6, connecting Uptown, Downtown, Dinkytown/University of Minnesota. This Route 6/LRT nexus is a good start for first-time visitors, as most hotels (provided youre staying in the city and not some airport/suburban business traveler hovel) are within a few minutes walk. If you stay at the airport you can get here via the LRT. Other suburban accommodations are likely to be located near express buses, which largely terminate one block over at Hennepin and South 4th Street. Ask your concierge.  Taking the LRT south from downtown, the first stop you might be interested in is The Metrodome. Home to the Minnesota Vikings (football) and the occasional rock concert, and formerly home to the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Golden Gophers (University of Minnesota) football, its a landmark. Alternately known as the Dome, the Homer Dome, and the Humper Dome, among others, its roof is instantly recognizable.     Next stop, Cedar/Riverside. If you walk a few blocks east to Cedar Avenue, theres a vibrant, diverse and sometimes dangerous neighborhood known, coincidentally, as Cedar-Riverside or the West Bank. When I say dangerous, Im not talking about Cabrini Green level crime, but a neighborhood where you should stay in well-lit areas and cab home if you have a few too many or stay a little too late. (Bars are open until 2AM) Before you are frightened away, theres much this neighborhood has to offer that shouldnt be missed.  East on Riverside Avenue is the Hard Times Cafe. Hard Times is only closed for two hours every day, from 4AM to 6AM. The food can vary widely depending on who is on duty. They offer good coffee, (often) loud music, games, etc.  The Nomad  is a little further south on Cedar Ave. It has a nice outdoor patio for smoking and inside a stage where you can see a variety of local rock or jazz shows. Across the street from The Nomad, is Palmers. Palmers gets a little rough if you dont know how to behave yourself while drinking. Not for the weak of heart or mind. Mind your own business if you go there. Keep heading back south down Cedar Avenue and youll come to the  Triple Rock Social Club , one of a number of Twin Cities music venues which seem to have arisen out of someones dream of parking a bar in their basement rec-room. The bar side has great food with a lot of vegetarian options. The club side has a big stage and fantastic sound system. Check their web site above for listings.   Still further down Cedar Avenue are the Whiskey Junction and The Cabooze. Whiskey Junction is a favorite hang out for bikers, but a good number of those are the suburban type with expensive Harley Davidsons. The crowd and atmosphere at the Cabooze varies widely, depending at least in part on who is doing their best interpretation of blues that night - from all those people who disappeared from campus freshman year to long-haired exurbans with Polaris ballcaps. Both venues offer live music most nights. If you make it to the Cabooze, youre already near the Franklin Avenue Light Rail stop. Get back on and head down to Lake Street.  Lake Street/Midtown has a lot to offer on weekend days in the spring and summer. Namely an outdoor market with lots of good food and locally made goodies. The neighborhood has become a center for Mexican and Central American immigrants, and hence the food of those regions, in Minneapolis. See the  Eat  section for more information. Worth a stop for sure. You can also catch a 21 bus from here to Uptown (make sure the bus is going west).  The next few stops take you to mostly residential neighborhoods. While there are things to do along them, theyre not easily accessible on foot, so well skip ahead to 50th Street/Minnehaha Park.  The Minnehaha Park station is adjacent to a park and Minnehaha Falls.  You can see the 53 foot falls and walk along the creek on its way to the Mississippi River.  The Fort Snelling station is located after the VA Medical Center station.  Fort Snelling makes a great day trip. Its the original settlement in  Minnesota and an early wilderness outpost.  Next is the Airport and then the Mall of America, the gargantuan monument to advanced capitalism. The MOA is not quite as sparkling as it was on its opening over two decades ago, but it is still the largest mall around and by some accounts the leading tourist destination in the United States. Tour operators from as far away as Japan organize charter flights and hotel bookings for the single purpose of experiencing "The Mall". It offers an indoor amusement park, movies, restaurants and more shopping than is comprehensible. Its a day trip in itself, but not for the thrifty. Food, shopping and the Camp Formerly Known as Snoopy (now Nickelodeon Universe) can burn through your wallet fast. Not for those with poor impulse control. For the tourist in you, check out local kitsch such as the Lake Wobegon Store.  The return trip: by disembarking at the Lake Street Station and catching a 21 Bus going west, or by returning to the LRT headwaters at Hennepin Avenue and catching a 6 Bus bearing south, one can end up at Uptown and the jewel of Minneapolis, the gorgeous Chain of Lakes. If youre here between Memorial Day and Labor Day, rent a canoe    at Lake Calhoun (stop at the nearby Lunds grocery on Lake Street for picnic materials) and see four lakes, three enchanting sheltered canals, two islands, and one classic creosote-tastic railroad trestle from a ducks eye view.   The 21 brings you past the Midtown Market and Lyn-Lake on the way, while the 6 takes you through downtown and past the gleaming Loring Park area, featuring the spectacular Basilica of St. Mary   , the infamous Spoon and Cherry   , and the shiny metal Rock Em-Sock Em Robot head that is the new Walker Art Center    expansion. Heading north on the 6 will take you across Nicollet Island, another of Minneapolis abundant urban havens, and through the original Minneapolis/St. Anthony milling district and a touch of the ethnic food and drink haven that is Northeast Minneapolis on the way to Dinkytown and the University of Minnesota (including an old campus district which is on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as some of the top libraries in the world).  NiceRide bike sharing lets you jump on a bike in downtown and take it anywhere.  The cost is minimal but the convenience isnt!</field>

Serving downtown Minneapolis, Target Field, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the airport, Mall of America, and points in between. This is the easiest, fastest, and safest bet for first-time visitors. Theres a lot to do along the route, and since there only is one route at the moment, the odds of getting lost are reduced. The next light rail line (the Green Line) will open in 2014 and connect downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis via the University of Minnesotas Minneapolis campus. It will primarily travel via University Avenue through Saint Paul and Washington Avenue through the University campus before reaching downtown Minneapolis where it will share the tracks with the Blue Line.    Bus.  Knowing your Route 2 from your Route 22 is considered one mark of a true-blue Twin Citian. The routes and fares are confusing to non-natives. The Metro Transit web site, however, is user-friendly. The Trip Planner lets you provide your beginning and ending points and times, and suggests the best route. You can customize this on walking distances, number of transfers, and the like. As routes are anything but linear, carry a schedule and map for any bus route you are riding; these are available on buses (above you and to your left after you pay) as well as at many city government buildings, libraries, and the like. Bus stops are nearly everywhere throughout the city, but some are served infrequently, and some are not labeled as to which routes serve them at which times. Be aware of the white Metro Transit notices sometimes posted at stops; routes often change due to construction or local events and parades.</field>

		<field name="content">Nice Ride bike-share kiosk  Biking in Minneapolis is a big deal. Over the years, it has invested heavily in bike trails, lanes and "bicycle boulevards," and a good chunk of its populace uses the man-powered two-wheeler to get around. The larger Twin Cities area also offers a good mix of off-road bike trails; for example one can bike from Chaska to St. Paul using only bike trails, some thirty miles. A variety of  maps  show the web of on and off-road routes that span the greater metropolitan area. During the winter, major bike trails such as the Midtown Greenway are plowed at the same time as major streets. In some neighborhoods like Downtown, Dinkytown, Uptown, and near the University of Minnesota campus, bikes are seen almost as often as cars.  One of the countrys largest urban bike rental programs opened in the summer of 2010.  Nice Ride Minnesota  two-wheelers are available for rent at 150 locations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul.  The Twin Cities also offer a big variety of cycling shops from very race oriented ones (e.g  Grand Performance  in St. Paul and  Flanders Bros  in Minneapolis) to more consumer oriented shops (e.g.  Penn Cycle ,  Eriks ,  Boehms ) to the most women-friendly worker cooperative bike shop,  The Hub Bike Co-op .  A very useful cycling shop for visitors and tourists is  Calhoun Cycle , which offers, among other services, offers bike rental (both regular and tandem bikes).  For additional cycling information in the Twin Cities area please visit the  Twin Cities Bicycling Club .</field>

		<field name="content">No discussion of getting around Minneapolis would be complete without mention of the Skyway.  Covering most of an approximate 7x7 block region of central downtown, the Skyway is a series of public pedestrian spaces on the 2nd floor of downtown buildings connected by enclosed bridges between buildings.  It is possible to walk through most of downtown and never go outdoors, a real advantage during winter.  Additionally, the Skyway allows you to bypass stoplights and quickly move through the city.  Beyond the core region, the Skyway reaches about 12 blocks in the north/south direction and 8 blocks east/west.  The Skyway is home to multiple restaurants, stores, shops and malls.  If visiting downtown Minneapolis during the winter, using a parking deck or staying at a hotel on or very near the Skyway is well worth the investment.   Hours vary slightly, but most buildings are open noon-6PM Sunday, 6:30AM-9PM or 10PM M-F and 9:30-8PM on Saturday.</field>

		<field name="content">Similarly to North Minneapolis, numbered avenues run east-west.  Due to the geometry of the river, these numbers are lower than the numbers of the North Minneapolis avenues opposite them. This only comes into play when you are crossing one of the bridges. Plymouth Ave is equivalent to N 13th Ave, but becomes NE 8th Ave.  Lowry Ave is equivalent to N 32nd Ave, but becomes the equivalent of NE 25th Ave east of the river. N 42nd Ave crosses the Camden Bridge to become NE 37th Ave. Except for a few numbered streets near the river and a few "half-blocks", the north-south running roads are called streets and are named after U.S. presidents in chronological order heading east.   The above rules break down in the area closest to downtown. The street grid turns from the strict compass-points grid to line up with the river, and a grid with both numbered streets (parallel to University Ave) and avenues (parallel to Hennepin Ave) holds sway. In the transition zone between the two grids, a brief mini-grid uses the names of the seasons.  Finally, streets in the industrial area on the eastern side of the area are more randomly named</field>

If you get lost or lose your bearings, remember that the main county roads running East-West are named after Presidents and other famous figures (but mostly Presidents) and begin, alphabetically, with Adams Rd. in the North near Michigan and end with Taylor in the South, near Marshall County.  North-South roads are named for trees and plants, beginning with Ash (called West County Line Rd. on the Elkhart County side of the road) in Eastern St. Joseph County and ending with Redwood in the West.  There are exceptions to this rule, however, such as Washington St. downtown, and Mishawaka has numbered streets.

		<field name="content">Mississippi has four major interstate highways.  I-55 runs North-South from New Orleans, McComb, to Memphis and runs through the state capitol of Jackson.  I-20 runs East-West from Vicksburg to Meridian and crosses I-55 in Jackson.  I-59 cuts across the southeast corner of the state connecting New Orleans to I-20 just west of Meridian.  I-59 and I-20 merge into one interstate at that point and head east until they split in Birmingham, AL.  I-10 runs the length of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  There are several interstate spurs and loops in Mississippi, the two of note are I-220 connecting I-20 to I-55 around the northwest perimeter of Jackson and I-110 connecting I-10 to US-90 (aka Beach Blvd) in Biloxi.  Interstate speed limits are mostly 70 miles per hour in rural areas, and 60 mph in urban areas.  State highways with 4 or more lanes are usually 65 miles per hour and slow down by 10 mph increments when they enter developed areas (usually no lower than 45 mph).  Typically, two-lane highways have a speed limit of 55 mph in rural areas.  Like any other state, Mississippi has a mixture of four-lane divided highways and two-lane rural highways and state routes.  However, Mississippi does provide a respectable number of multi-lane highways.  Highway 49 is a 4-lane highway that connects the Gulf Coast to Jackson and crosses the Mississippi River at Helena.  Highway 98 connects I-55 and I-59 across the lower half of the state.  Highway 25 (state route) connects Jackson to Starkville (Mississippi State University).  Highway 82 runs east-west in the upper half of the state.  Pay attention to your maps and ask the workers on duty at the state welcome centers for help.  You might find a shorter route than if you stay on the interstates.  Most on-line mapping services assume the worst about state highways when compared to interstates.  Get of the road and enjoy slower pace.  Highway 51 runs parallel to I-55 through the state.  Except in urban areas, US 51 is a fairly scenic route.  The  Natchez Trace Parkway  is also a scenic option and is operated by the National Park Service. Just obey the speed limits.  US 80 parallels I-20 across the state, but makes for a more interesting drive by taking you through towns that were bypassed.  US 90, also known as Beach Blvd, is about as far south you can get in MS.  US 90 along the coast line between St Louis Bay and the Back Bay of Biloxi.  Be aware that when refueling your car that if you intend to use your credit card (particularly credit card accounts issued from banks outside of the US), you may experience problems using the self-serve stations.  Most self-serve gas stations may require the purchaser to input their home ZIP code (a five-digit mail routing address used in the US) as a means of identifying the purchaser, as smart credit cards are not widely used in the US.  Also be aware that there are very few full-service gas stations in America (where a gas station attendant fuels the car for you), but you may find a few in the much smaller areas in Mississippi.</field>

If you have plenty of time and you are not in a hurry to get to your final destination, this might be an interesting way to visit the state. The main disadvantages of rail travel in Mississippi are that there are only a few stations that are still in use, sometimes travel times may be long, and the routes are limited so you cannot explore the state very well.    Here are the stations that are still in service:   City of New Orleans (North / South route):  McComb ,  Brookhaven ,  Jackson ,  Yazoo City , and  Greenwood .    Sunset Limited (Gulf coast route): Only the city of  Biloxi  has service.   Crescent (Southeastern route):  Hattiesburg  and  Meridian .</field>

		<field name="content">The easiest and most convenient way to get around Montana will probably always be by car. Destinations are spread wide even within a single city, and within cities, parking is usually ample and cheap, if not free. Rental cars are widely available, and the option to pick up in one city and drop off in another is available, though expensive.  Montana is traversed by three major interstates.  I-15 runs north-south from Alberta, Canada through Western Montana to Idaho. I-90 runs north from Sheridan, Wyoming to near Billings then runs west through Bozeman, Butte, and Missoula to Idaho. I-94 runs from the North Dakota border west to join with I-90 just east of Billings.  A few US Highways provide mainline travel through interesting areas of the state. Highway 2 - The Hi-Line, a fabled highway running through northern Montana from the North Dakota border near Bainville to the Idaho border near Troy for 666 miles. The highway runs through the plains and prairies east of the continental divide, through the Fort Peck Indian Reservation town of Wolf Point, through Glasgow, Malta, Havre, Shelby and  Cut Bank  until crossing the continental divide, running the south side of Glacier National Park to  Kalispell , Libby and the border. Highway 12 runs a meandering east to west route from Lolo Pass to the North Dakota border near Baker, through heavily forested, winding roads in the West to the dramatic flats and plains to the East. The highway runs a meandering route from Lolo Pass to Missoula, overlaps with I-90 until Garrison, continues on to Helena, then proceeds for almost 250 miles until merging with I-94 through Miles City, then continues on to the North Dakota border near the southern edge of the state.</field>

		<field name="content">One aspect of Myrtle Beach that is less-than hospitable are its roads. A tourist may find the style of driving in Myrtle Beach to be aggressive, reckless and hard to manage. Myrtle Beach has one of the highest accident rates in the state, due in part to its impatient drivers and oddly-placed roads.  If you must drive, plan ahead - if you are going a short distance (under five miles), then take one of the main roads that runs adjacent to the beach. If you are going a longer distance, try and take one of the interstate roads that branches further out - these are generally clear of traffic, and thus are much more bearable than the city roads.  There are several car rental companies located in Myrtle Beach, including Alamo Rent-a-Car, National Car Rental, Avis Rent-a-Car, and Budget Car Rental.</field>

		<field name="name">desert travel</field>
		<field name="content">Theres an awful lot of desert to explore in Nevada, and its very easy to leave civilization behind.  While that is a worthy goal, common sense is necessary to avoid life-threatening situations. Heres some tips for traveling to the more remote desert areas of Nevada:   What to Drive: Vehicle breakdown and getting stuck are the easiest ways to get into serious trouble in the desert.  Dont travel far from the pavement in a low-clearance vehicle.  Four wheel drive is strongly recommended for the winter months, and is advised for unpaved mountain roads anytime.  It is best to travel in a convoy of multiple vehicles, so that one breakdown will not strand you.  Gas stations are few, far between, and often not open around the clock, so it is a good idea to carry extra fuel.  If you do break down or run out of fuel, your best bet is to stay with the vehicle unless youre within 10 miles or so of civilization -  Odds are that someone will come by in a day or two. Nevada Desert Trees - Palm Trees    Roads: Nevada is criss-crossed with unpaved roads, some of which are maintained, most of which are not.  Due to the slow growth rate of vegetation, once a road is established it can remain passable for decades with no maintenance and little traffic.  Few roads have culverts, so be on the look-out for washed out areas.  These generally arent a problem if traversed slowly, but can cause serious damage if you dont slow down in time.     Fences: The boundaries between grazing allotments are fenced as are the boundaries between public and private land.  On higher volume roads there will be a "cattle-guard" on the road which is passable by vehicles but not by cattle.  Lower volume roads will have a gate across the road.  Always leave the gate in the same condition as you found it - if open leave it open, if closed make sure you close it behind you.  Gates leading into private land will sometimes be locked or marked with a "No Trespassing" sign, in which case you should respect the property owners wishes and find another way to get where you want to go.     Livestock: In open rangeland (just about everywhere in Nevada), cattle have the right-of-way.  It is not uncommon for ranchers to leave hay and water for their stock close to a road, and thus it is not uncommon to encounter herds of cattle on or near the road.  You should always slow way down for these herds, as the calves especially have a nasty habit of running out in front of cars.  You break it, you buy it. Cattle are half-wild, often ornery.  Dont approach them closely on foot.   Navigation: Navigation in Nevada is fairly easy if you keep your wits about you.  The poverty of vegetation gives astonishingly long sight distance, and mountain ranges are ubiquitous for reference.  Large-scale topographic maps of the entire state are available in bound form at most bookstores and many gas stations.  These should be sufficient for most purposes.  Smaller scale topographic maps are published by the US Geologic Survey (USGS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and can be purchased at outdoors-oriented stores (such as the REI in  Reno ) or photocopied at the University of Nevada-Reno (UNR) library. The BLM maps tend to be more up-to-date with regards to roads, but are more difficult to find.  Due to the small scale of these maps, they are not practical for long-range vehicle travel, but can be very useful on hiking trips.     Weather: Most of Nevada is cold desert above 4,000/1,300m elevation with summer daytime temperatures around 85F/30C and nights cooling sharply to 50F/10C.  Winter temperatures are more variable and can drop far below zero (fahrenheit or celsius).  Lower elevations in the  Las Vegas  area create hot desert with summer daytime temperatures consistently above 100F/40C and little nighttime relief, but pleasant winters. Carry extra clothing, sleeping bags and tire chains between October and April and remember that occasional snowstorms are possible above 4,000/1,300m as late as June.  Summer thunderstorms can be locally intense, causing flash-floods where roads cross normally-dry washes.  Wear a hat, long shirt, long pants, sunblock; and drink plenty of water to avoid heat stroke and sunburn in the summer.   Water: Away from municipal water districts, water supplies are few, far between, and usually contaminated by livestock except in the highest mountains.  Bring enough in your vehicle for your entire trip, plus a few days reserve, with extra for your vehicles radiator in case it starts leaking. When hiking, seek local knowledge about water supplies on multi-day trips.  Dont rely solely on maps.   Rail Crossings: When travelling along the dirt roads of Nevada, you will undoubtedly need to cross a railroad which has no warning signs or lights.  If you can see or hear a train WAIT for the train to pass.  In the open range distance is very deceiving and the trains travel exceedingly fast compared to what you may be used to in built up areas.  The reflections from the sun and shifting heat waves can easily disguise a moving train to look far away in the distance. That train which looks "miles away" may in fact be within moments of passing through the crossing you are waiting at.</field>

		<field name="content">Amtrak covers urban New England pretty extensively with the Northeast Corridor ( Boston - Rhode Island - Connecticut ), the Vermonter ( Washington, D.C. - Vermont ), and the Downeaster ( Boston - Portland -- Brunswick ). The Acela Express is a high-speed train that follows roughly the same route as the Northeast Corridor. Note that  Boston  has two train major stations, South Station and North Station.   Trains from South Station serve areas to the south and west of the city, and North Station trains serve areas north of the city.  All Amtrak trains to and from  Boston , except the train to  Portland  are available at South Station, but not North Station.  The train to  Portland  is available only at North Station.  There is no direct connection between the two stations.  Those wishing to connect between the two stations must either take a taxi, or take two subway lines, or walk about 2 km/ 1.2 miles through busy city streets.  Information and train schedules are available from Amtraks  web site .  Commuter rail and bus lines radiate out from  New York City  and  Boston  for a distance of about 50 km/30 miles.  The  MBTA  covers the greater Boston area with its commuter rail network, including  Providence ,  Lowell , and  Worcester .  The  MTA Metro North  provides very frequent and affordable service between  New York City  and  New Haven ; at New Haven there are numerous connections to points north and east.  Remember, though, that commuter service is infrequent outside of weekday morning and evening rush hours.</field>

Typically, these islands are compact enough that the visitor does not require a car to visit them.  Relatively flat coastal terrain and light traffic makes it easy to get around them by walking or bicycling.  Taking a car on the ferry is expensive and usually requires reservations long in advance.  In any case, many ferries are for passengers and bicycles only.</field>

		<field name="name">with a car</field>
		<field name="content">Be alert that the streets of much of the city were laid out before the automobile, especially in the older parts of town of most interest to visitors. There are many one way streets, and in some neighborhoods two-way side streets may be so narrow that cars going one way may need to pull to the side to let vehicles going the other way pass when someone has parked on the street.  Due to consolidation of the underlying soils, potholes are common and road conditions are often poor for a developed country.  Street signage is sometimes unclear or missing, and some signage lost in Katrina not yet replaced, although the situation has been improving significantly.  Parking is often hard to find around many areas of interest to tourists, but there are generally pay lots in the area. Hotel parking can cost over $30/night downtown and in the French Quarter. One garage in the Quarter offers a  discount coupon  that can be printed out before hand. They only charge $15/night when a customer presents the coupon.   Those who dont know how to parallel park may wish to just leave their car in a pay lot when visiting much of the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Orlean Streetcars.svg|thumb|New Orlean streetcar network (http://sharemap.org/public//New%20Orlean%20Streetcars interactive version )existing, under construction, planned]]  Those staying in or near the French Quarter can easily get around by foot, with optional occasional trips by streetcar, bus, or cab if they wish to visit other parts of town. In the French Quarter, bicycle rentals are available at a bike shop on Dauphine Street near the hotels of Canal St as well as at an antique shop on Decatur Street near the French Market. Other places with bike rentals include a bicycle shop in the Marigny Triangle neighborhood on Frenchmen Street and another Uptown on Magazine Street.  The Riverfront, Canal Street and St. Charles streetcars travel to or near many of the sites listed here. Fares for buses or streetcars are $1.25, 25¢ extra for a transfer (good only on another line but not a return trip on the same line). Express buses are $1.50. Day passes are available for $3. All buses and streetcars provide change cards.  Public transit is by the  New Orleans Regional Transit Authority ("RTA") .  Note on Mardi Gras: During  Mardi Gras  in February, transportation of any sort will be a challenge. If you decide to get your own car, parking will be exorbitant (as high as $10 per hour) in the French Quarter and the City Area. Should you try to get a taxi, chances are you will have to call more than one company, and several times each, before you get a booking. After that, you will probably have to wait an average of 45 minutes to one hour. If you wish to travel from across town during Mardi Gras, is strongly recommended that you do get a car and park close to the streetcars or just outside the city area.</field>

		<field name="name">knowing which way is up</field>
		<field name="content">The older neighborhoods of the city, (which comprise nearly 45% of the city), were laid out along the banks of the Mississippi River. Except for the grid of the French Quarter, streets were laid out either following the rivers curves or perpendicular to them, not according to compass directions or a grid.    For this reason, locals in these parts of town often dont give directions according to "north, south, east, and west". The four directions, instead, are "up" (or "up river" or "up town"), "down" (or "down river" or "down town"), "river" (or "towards the river" or sometimes "in"), and "lake" (or "towards the lake" or "back" or sometimes "out"). Dont be daunted, this makes sense when you take a moment to understand it.   Look at a map of the city. If, for example, you are taking the streetcar that runs along Saint Charles Avenue from the French Quarter to Carrollton, you see that the route starts off going south, then over some miles gradually turns west, and winds up running northwest. This is because Saint Charles reflects a bend in the river. From the local perspective, the entire route goes one way: up (or on the return trip from Carrollton to the Quarter, down).  Know that Canal Street is the up river boundary of the French Quarter. (Keep going further "up" away from the Quarter and youll be in "Uptown".)   Some streets are labeled "North" and "South", this reflects which side of Canal Street they are on (despite the fact that Canal Street runs from southeast to northwest). The part of Rampart Street on the French Quarter side is North Rampart Street; the part on the Central Business District side is South Rampart.  Also, a good map of the entire city is a must, as people from out of town may have to learn to simply match letters on signs to letters on the map.  You see, most street names are French and Creole in origin and may be hard to pronounce.  For instance, try to pronounce these example street names : Urquhart, Rocheblave, Dorgenois, Terpsichore, Tchoupitoulas, Burthe, Freret.  (For the record, locals say "Urk-heart, Roach-a-blave, Der-gen-wa, Terp-sic-cor, Chop-a-two-lis, Byouth, Fa-ret.") Now you understand.  Many major New Orleans streets are divided, with a "neutral ground" (median) running down the middle.  For this reason, the traffic lights have no dedicated cycle for a protected left turn.  On streets with a wide neutral ground, there is a solution.  Imagine turning from an avenue to a street; the solution is to turn left on green, queue in the stretch of the street between the two halves of the avenue, then proceed once the traffic light on the street has turned green.  On streets with a narrow neutral ground, there is not enough room for cars to queue.  In these situations, left turns are often prohibited; the solution is to go straight, take the next U-turn, then take a right turn when you arrive back at the intersection.  Streets such as Tulane Avenue famously have "No Left Turn" signs posted for miles. In these situations, the adage "three rights make a left" comes in handy.</field>

Monmouth Street is the main commercial district and the area around Newport on the Levee its main Entertainment district.   Parking can be difficult. The Levee has a parking garage, but on weekends it can be full.  It used to be free to park on the riverfront, but the restaurants in the boats on the river banded together to jack up prices to rates way above what youd pay to park in the Levee garage, expect to pay around $6 to park there.  Finally you could try parking on the narrow city streets, but keep your eye out for any parking restrictions such as street cleaning.</field>

		<field name="name">major routes</field>
		<field name="content">400px   The most important highway in New York is the  New York State Thruway , which runs on I-90 from the Pennsylvania border in the west, northeast to Buffalo, then east past Rochester, through Syracuse, and to Albany.  I-90 continues to Boston while the Thruway picks up I-87 south to New York City.  The Thruway, a toll road for most of its length, is the primary route between the major upstate cities and is often used to get to and from New York.  Expect to pay about four cents a mile ($13.10 from Downtown Buffalo to Downtown Albany for a car with no trailer, for example).  Most New Yorkers grumble at the price but pay it anyway for the efficiency the route offers.  To allow travelers to avoid leaving the highway (and paying a toll) before they reach their destinations, the Thruway is dotted with large service plazas every 35ndash;50 miles or so.  Each contains two or three restaurants/snack stands (at least one restaurant will be open all night) and a gift shop/convenience store.  Burger King, Tim Hortons, Roy Rogers, and TCBY are among the more common vendors.  Vending machines, free wi-fi, and of course gas pumps are available as well.  Gas prices are high, but such are the benefits of having a "captive audience".  A cheaper but slightly slower route to New York City from the west is along I-86, the  Southern Tier  Expressway.  State Route 17, which I-86 is supplanting, is still in the process of being upgraded to Interstate standards; east of Binghamton youll encounter a few at-grade intersections, but its still a quick route, and its toll-free. Be warned, however, in Binghamton near the interchange with I-88 and I-81 blasting is currently being done to widen and straighten the route so traffic is occasionally stopped for a few minutes during construction months. NYDOT and regional news will report blasting schedules several days in advanced.  The slowest but most "interesting" route across the state is U.S. Route 20.  As a route stretching coast-to-coast across the northern U.S., it covers much of the same ground as Interstate 90 does today.  U.S. 20 is much older, though, traveling right through the middle of countless old villages that lie south of the Thruway.  Its a simple two-lane highway for most of its length in New York, but if you have the time and the patience, it can be more interesting than the long stretches of nothingness along the Thruway or the Southern Tier Expressway.  I-81 and I-87 are the major north-south routes.  I-81 travels south from the  Thousand Islands  at the Canadian border through Syracuse and Binghamton into Pennsylvania.  I-87 (known as the Northway north of Albany) connects Montreal in Quebec with Albany and New York City.  I-88 travels diagonally northeast-southwest, providing a connection between Binghamton and Albany.  The only significant east-west route across the top of the state is U.S. 11, which diverges from I-81 in Watertown and heads northeast, then east.  In Western New York, Rochester is connected to points south via I-390 to Corning.  From Buffalo, travelers can head southwest along I-90 or south along U.S. Route 219, which is currently being upgraded to expressway.  (Those heading southeast will take the Thruway to I-390.)</field>

		<field name="content">New York has a good network of state routes, supplemented by county routes in some counties.  Most villages are at the intersection of two or more state routes, and signage is usually clear, making it relatively simple to find your way to a particular place.  You can be fairly confident that numbered state routes will be well maintained (including plowed in the winter) and rarely too far from civilization.  Some interesting itineraries can be devised just by following a particular route wherever it leads.  In general, one- and two-digit state routes will be primary routes, although plenty of exceptions exist; you shouldnt assume anything just from the number.  Major cross-state routes include 3, 5, 7, 17, and 104.</field>

		<field name="content">Municipalities in New York are well prepared for winter weather, but it can get so severe at times that even their expert crews cant keep up.  Pay attention to travel advisories; in New York, if they say stay off the roads, they really mean it! During less severe winter storms, drive slowly and carefully.  Follow a snowplow (at a safe distance!) if you can, though watch out for ones dropping salt.  Cell phone service can be spotty in the northern part of the state; be aware that you may not be able to easily call for help on the highways in that region.  A few miscellaneous traffic laws:  State law mandates that your headlights must be on if your windshield wipers are running.  Drivers, front-seat passengers, and children sitting anywhere must wear seat belts with primary enforcement.  You are not permitted to use hand-held cellular phones while driving; hands-free phones are permitted but use with extra caution.  Turning right on red light is permitted after stop, except where signs indicate otherwise like "NO TURN ON RED". However, this rule is reversed in  New York City .  There is no turn on red arrow.  Vehicles turning left must yield to oncoming traffic unless they have a green left-arrow.  The state speed limit is 55 mph, unless otherwise posted, as is the case with rural expressways being 65.  Speed limits on surface roads will generally be 30 within cities and villages, except on the outskirts where it might be 35-45.  School zones may have a limit of 15 to 45 mph during school hours, 7am-6pm.  New York has a safe and prudent speed law, so in adverse weather conditions, you can be pulled over even if you are below the posted limit if you appear to be sliding or otherwise struggling to maintain control over your vehicle.</field>

Expressways are mostly limited to Interstates with a few exceptions.  Expressway exits are numbered sequentially in New York, a fact unremarkable to New Englanders but potentially confusing for everyone else.  If youre at Exit 2 and looking for Exit 28, you have a lot farther to go than just 26 miles.</field>

The Lake Shore Limited from  Chicago  has stops in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, and Albany; from there riders can switch trains to  Boston  or continue (with a stop in Croton-on-Hudson) to New York Citys Penn Station.  The Empire Service starts in Niagara Falls but follows the same route as the Lake Shore Limited once it gets to Buffalo, with some additional stops along the way.  The Maple Leaf is identical to the Empire Service except that it continues across the Canadian border to  Toronto .  The Adirondack line travels roughly along I-87 from New York City to  Montreal .

		<field name="content">For shorter distances, there is no better way of getting around New York than hitting the sidewalk. If you use the subway or buses, you will almost certainly need to walk to and from stations or stops. In all areas of New York a traveler is likely to visit, all streets have wide, smoothly-paved sidewalks. For long distances, walking is also fine and a great way to see the city.</field>

		<field name="name">types of metrocards</field>
		<field name="content">Up to three children 44 inches tall and under ride for free on subways and local buses when accompanied by a fare paying adult.   MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.  A $1 fee is charged for each MetroCard purchased at station booths and vending machines.  Single Ride MetroCard - costs $2.75 and is good for one use. It allows no free transfers between the subway and bus, and it is only valid for two hours after purchase.  Pay-Per-Ride (Regular) MetroCards - are available in amounts from $5.00 to $80. Each local bus or subway trip deducts $2.50 from your card; each express buses trip deducts $6.00. Usage of the PATH system deducts $2.00, and usage of JFK Airtrain deducts $5.00. Note that you can always add additional money to your MetroCard at a later time. Additionally, you receive a 5% bonus for purchases of $5 or more (e.g. a $10 purchase yields a credit of $10.50). Regular MetroCard is the best option if you are spending a few days in New York and plan to use public transportation intermittently.  :Additionally, a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard allows for one free transfer during a two hour window immediately following a paid fare: :From subway to local bus :From local bus to subway :From local bus to local bus (but not to any bus on the same route as the first) :From express bus to subway :From express bus to local bus :From express bus to express bus (but not to any bus on the same route as the first)  :You can transfer from subway to subway as often as you like provided that you do not exit the subway system by leaving through a turnstile or gate. Many subway connections are possible in this way, by using in-station connections between the various lines. Indeed, the Guinness Book of World Records tracks the fastest times of groups that have tried to ride every single New York City subway train line on one fare - some have spent over 24 consecutive hours riding in the subway! Just remember that if you leave the subway and re-enter, you will be charged a second fare.  :Additionally, if you board a local bus and pay the $2.50 fare with a MetroCard, you can transfer to an express bus for the reduced price of $3.50 (instead of the standard $6.00 express bus fare).  Unlimited Ride MetroCards - are available in 7-day ($30) and 30-day ($112). They are valid from the time you first use them until midnight of the 7th and 30th day, respectively. Do the math; these cards may work out to be cheaper if you plan on using public transport frequently during your stay.  Roughly, it works out to two trips every day for a week so those who commute round-trip within the city every day can benefit from this.  Note that Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. Once used, 18 minutes must elapse before it can be used at the same station (or on the same bus route). This is to prevent people from using a single Unlimited Ride MetroCard to pay for an entire group, for example. Hence, each member of the group will require their own Unlimited Ride MetroCard. Unlimited Ride MetroCards are NOT valid on express buses, JFK AirTrain, or PATH trains to New Jersey.  7-Day Express Bus Plus - costs $55 and allows unlimited use of not just local buses and subways, but also express buses. If you are staying in Staten Island, Queens, or Westchester county and plan to commute to the city during your visit, this pass may be advantageous to you.  Also available are two passes good only for unlimited use of the JFK Airtrain: a 30-day unlimited AirTrain pass for $40, and a 10-trip pass for $25.  You can also get discounted tickets to certain events by showing your MetroCard when purchasing tickets. Current promotions are listed on  the MetroCard website</field>

		<field name="content">MetroCard  To ride the buses and subways in New York City, it is most likely that you will need a MetroCard. The  Metropolitan Transit Authority , or MTA, sells MetroCards for use on the New York City bus and subway systems. While it is possible to pay bus fare using exact change (coins only), you must have a MetroCard to enter the subway system. Cards can be bought online, at station booths, at vending machines in subway stations, and  at many grocery stores and newsstands  (look for a MetroCard sign on the store window). The vending machines in the stations accept credit cards; however, MetroCard vending machines will require that you type in your 5-digit zip code, or your regular PIN on international cards.   The PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) subway system, which operates between New York and New Jersey, is not operated by the MTA and is therefore a separate fare. Even though PATH accepts payment by MetroCard, no free transfers are available to or from MTA subways or buses, because PATH is separate. JFK AirTrain also accepts MetroCard, but again, is not operated by the MTA and therefore no free transfers are available.  Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJT), and Amtrak trains do not accept MetroCard.</field>

		<field name="content">To enter the subway, you will need to swipe your MetroCard through the slot on the right hand side of the turnstile that greets you at the subway entrance. Hold your card with the logo facing your body and black magnetic strip down. Then slide it forward through the slot at a moderate speed. Youll know you succeeded when the display flashes "Go" in green and you hear a CLICK sound. Only once you hear the CLICK is it OK to walk through the turnstile. Swiping the card improperly or moving the turnstile incorrectly could mean the forfeiture of your fare (for Pay-Per-Ride cards) or a lockout of 18 minutes (for Unlimited Ride cards). If this happens, go to a station booth and explain the problem. The agent will ask for your MetroCard, confirm that it was just charged, and let you go through.   Overhead signage next to each track indicates the train lines that stop at that particular track and the direction they are heading. In addition, the trains themselves are marked by signage that indicates their line. Subway stations are ventilated to the street, so they can be quite cold in the winter. In summertime, the stations can be much warmer than the outside temperature. The trains themselves are quite comfortable, but keep the temperature of stations in mind when planning your trip.   Some lines are express, meaning that they skip local stations to provide faster service. Wherever there is an express train, there is also a local train that makes all stops. Local and express lines often use different tracks, so be sure to board the correct train. For example, the 2 and 3 are the express trains for the 7th Avenue Line between 96th Street and Chambers Street in Manhattan, while the 1 runs local alongside them.   During weekends and late nights, certain trains do not operate, many express trains make local stops, and some subway entrances are closed. Detailed information is available on  the MTA website . Additionally, maintenance work is usually concentrated on weekends and overnight. Notices of maintenance are posted at stations and on  the MTA website , so check online to avoid unpleasant surprises. Remember, if you do feel confused, ask for help. Be aware that construction related service changes confuse many New Yorkers, so the best person to ask is a subway employee. The entire subway system is a massive, connected network, so do not fear — there will always be another way to get to your destination.   A free subway map can be  found online , or obtained at staffed station booths. Station agents can also assist you with directions.  Even if not taking the bus, the free bus system maps for each borough double as fairly good street maps that show the exact location of every subway station.  For directions on how to travel between two addresses in the city via subway, buses, regional rail, or walking, see  HopStop.com . Additionally, for convenience, subway maps are displayed in every station and on every train.</field>

		<field name="name">route overview</field>
		<field name="content">Every subway line is identified by either a letter or a number. In midtown Manhattan, they are mostly grouped by color, but not always.   The Lexington Avenue Line trains (4, 5, 6) are essentially the only trains on the East Side above 23 St. Useful to get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street Station or 6 to 77th Street Station), Guggenheim Museum (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street Station), and other East Side museums. Also to get to the Statue of Liberty (4, 5 to Bowling Green Station), Chinatown (6 to Canal Street Station), and the Stock Exchange (4 and 5 to Wall Street). The 4 also goes uptown through Spanish Harlem to 161 St. - Yankee Stadium and beyond.   The Seventh Avenue Line (1, 2, 3) serves Broadway above 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue below 42nd Street. Useful to get to the West Village, Chelsea, and Tribeca neighborhoods as well as the Staten Island or Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty ferries (1 to South Ferry Station) and Columbia University (1 to 116th Street Station).    The Eighth Avenue Line (A, C, E) serves Eighth Avenue between 14th and 116th streets, then St. Nicholas Av., Broadway, and Ft. Washington Av. starting at 125th St. in  Harlem . Between 50th and 59th streets, the E branches off to Queens, and the B and D lines join the A and C lines for the journey uptown along Central Park West (the B and C make local stops). This section is useful to get to the Natural History Museum (B and C to 81st Street Station), and Cloisters Museum (A to 190th Street Station). Take an uptown E train or a Rockaway-bound A train for access to JFK Airport.    The Sixth Avenue Line (B, D, F, M) runs on 6th Ave. from West 4th St. to 47th-50th street, and is useful for accessing the New York Public Library Main Branch (42nd St.), Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patricks Cathedral (47th-50th Sts.). Going downtown, these lines go on their own separate routes. The D goes down 4th Ave. in Brooklyn to Coney Island. The F goes to Coney Island on its own route. The B stops at Brighton Beach alongside the Q line, which also goes to Coney Island. The M goes east alongside the Nassau Street line (J,Z), but then branches again up Myrtle Avenue to Middle Village in Queens. The J and Z lines, meanwhile, either continue east to through  Williamsburg  and other Brooklyn neighborhoods to  Jamaica , or west into southern Manhattan, via the Williamsburg bridge. Going uptown, the B and D trains branch west and join the A and C lines (see above). They branch again toward the Bronx after 145th Street (which is the way to get to the 161 St. - Yankee Stadium stop). The M train branches east and joins the E along 53rd street for the Museum of Modern Art, then head off to Queens. The F train makes one more 6th avenue stop at 57th street, then turns east to Queens, making a stop at  Roosevelt Island , and joining the E, M, and R trains.    The Broadway Line (N, Q, R) runs down Broadway below 42nd Street and on Seventh Avenue and 59th street above Times Square. The N, Q, and R trains are useful for accessing Chinatown (Canal St), SoHo/NoHo, NYU area, Union Square (14th St), the Empire State Building (34th St), Times Square (42nd St), Carnegie Hall (57th St.), Central Park (57th St and 5th Av stations), and the southern end of the Upper East Side. The R trains also go down to Financial District and South Ferry (Whitehall St). Like the D and F trains, the N and Q trains also provide service to Coney Island in their own separate routes: The N goes solo, and the Q runs alongside the B (see above).   The Flushing Line (7), dubbed the "International Express", runs crosstown along 42nd street (making a good late-night alternative to the upstairs shuttle (see below)) and out to Queens, making stops in Filipino, South Asian, Hispanic, and Chinese/Korean neighborhoods, and also to CitiField and the USTA Billie Jean King Tennis Center.   The Canarsie Line (L) also runs crosstown along 14th Street in Manhattan, then through  Williamsburg  and Bushwick and eventually to Canarsie in Brooklyn.   The Crosstown Line (G) runs along most of Western Brooklyn and into Long Island City in Queens. At no point on its route does it stop in Manhattan.   There are three Shuttles (indicated with an "S") throughout the system. The 42nd Street Shuttle connects Times Square on the West Side, with Grand Central Terminal on the East Side. The Franklin Avenue shuttle in Brooklyn makes four stops at Fulton Street (transfer to C), Park Place, Botanical Gardens (transfer to 2,3,4, and 5), and Prospect Park (transfer to B and Q). The Rockaway Shuttle runs alongside the A train between Broad Channel and Beach 116th Street.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of the New York City Subway   Despite a reputation for being dirty, the subway, which operates 24 hours per day, is the fastest and best way to travel around the city. Fares are $2.50 (unless you use Single Ride MetroCard, which is $2.75), regardless of distance traveled. The much-feared subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are for the most part a thing of the past, and it is almost always completely safe. Just remember to use common sense when traveling late at night alone. Try to use heavily-traveled stations, remain visible to other people, and dont display items of value publicly. While violent crime is rare, petty crime - especially theft of iPhones and other expensive electronics - is very frequent, so be aware when using your phone on the train.</field>

		<field name="content">The PATH can be used to travel within Manhattan, from 33rd St along 6th Ave to Christopher Street. It covers such a small territory but in theory you can use it if you have to travel its exact route.  Note that Unlimited Ride Metrocards cannot be used on the PATH. PATH also accepts the SmartLink Card (similar to the MetroCard, but the SmartLink Card cannot be used on the subway). The PATH train can be a great way to get around lower Midtown along 6 Avenue. Like the subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Usually, PATH trains arrive every 5–10 minutes (based on the time), but overnight, they may only come every 35 minutes.</field>

It is free except at the Tompkinsville and St. George stations. There, the price is the same as the subway ($2.50), and is payable by MetroCard (free transfers from MTA buses work, just as is the case with subways). SIR departure times from the terminal at St. George are usually coordinated with those of the  Staten Island Ferry . The SIR consists of one line that travels along the East Shore of Staten Island, ending at Tottenville. A full timetable with other information can be found  here .</field>

		<field name="name">by commuter rail</field>
		<field name="content">Commuter rail lines are mostly used for traveling between the city and its suburbs; however, they can be used for intracity transit as well. A handful of destinations are closer to commuter rail stops but far from the subway. MetroCards are not accepted on commuter rail; separate single or period tickets must be bought. When purchasing commuter railroad tickets, it is advantageous to purchase them online or in railroad stations prior to boarding. While tickets are available for sale on trains, there is an on-board surcharge that makes them significantly more expensive.  The  Long Island Railroad , often called the LIRR runs to/from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, Flatbush Avenue/Atlantic Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn, and has limited rush hour service to/from Long Island City, Queens. The Port Washington Branch goes to  Northeast Queens  which, aside from Flushing and Citi Field, is not served by the subway system. The Main Line, which contains most of the branches to the different parts of Long Island, goes to  Southeastern Queens , including Jamaica, Laurelton, and Rosedale. The Atlantic Branch, which ends in  Downtown Brooklyn , goes to  East New York  and  Bedford-Stuyvesant , both in  Brooklyn . This branch is not accessible from Manhattan, however. The LIRR is also the fastest way to get from JFK to Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, and also runs to many popular getaways in  Long Island , such as Long Beach, Port Jefferson, and Montauk. The LIRR has a somewhat deserved reputation for poor on-time performance, however this is more of a problem in the farther eastern reaches of the railroad and not so much a problem in New York City and its immediate suburbs.  The  Metro-North Railroad  provides services to/from Grand Central Terminal. Trains go to the Bronx and the northern suburbs of the city.  The Hudson Line covers several parts of the Western Bronx, while the Harlem Line goes through the Central Bronx — an area with no subway service. It is the best way to get to Arthur Avenue and the New York Botanic Gardens. The Hudson and Harlem Lines are also your gateway to  Westchester County  and beyond, with the Hudson Line running all the way to  Poughkeepsie . The New Haven Line runs to  Connecticut , terminating, logically enough, in  New Haven .</field>

		<field name="section">by bus</field>
		<field name="name">bus basics</field>
		<field name="content">Bus lines are identified by letters followed by numbers. The letters indicate the borough in which the line mostly operates (M=Manhattan; Bx=Bronx; B=Brooklyn; Q=Queens; S=Staten Island). Collectively, the letters and numbers make up the route (examples: M31, Bx9, M15). Signage at each bus stop indicates which buses stop there. Signage on the front of each bus indicates the route and destination of the bus. Bus maps for each borough can be found at  the MTA website .   Express buses travel between Manhattan and the outer boroughs, usually to areas where the subway doesnt operate (such as eastern Queens, the eastern Bronx, southeast Brooklyn, and Staten Island). They cost $6.00 but offer comfortable cloth seats and are less crowded than the subway and local buses. Most Express buses are identified with either "X" (x1,x2,x63,x68) or by the Borough they connect to Manhattan. So Express buses to and from the Bronx would be labeled BxM (BxM11, BxM18), to and from Brooklyn would be labeled BM(BM1,BM2) and to and from Queens QM(QM1,QM2). Staten Island express buses and a few Brooklyn and Queens express buses are labeled with "X".   When boarding a bus with a MetroCard, insert the card vertically, with the pin hole down, the black stripe to the right and the word "MetroCard" facing towards you, into the card slot in the top of the fare box next to the driver. You should be able to read the word "MetroCard" from bottom to top when inserting the card in this manner. The fare box will swallow the card, read it, and return it to you. Note this is different from the procedure to enter the subway described in  Subway Basics .   Bus fareboxes also accept coins. However, they will not accept pennies or half-dollar (50 cent) coins, nor will they accept bills. As a safety precaution, drivers do not handle money. Change is not given, so exact fares must be paid. If you pay with coins and require a free transfer, you will have to ask the driver for one after you have paid.   Certain buses contain a small orange and purple card in the window that says "Limited." These limited buses do not make all local bus stops, stopping only at major cross streets. They are similar to express buses in some ways, but only cost the standard $2.50 to ride. If a Limited bus skips your stop, you can wait for a local bus which will arrive soon. On some Avenues where there is at least two or more bus routes serving it, some bus routes may operate Limited on the entire avenue or at least until they branch off. For Example the m1,m2,m3,m4,m5; the m2 and m5 provide limited-stop service on 5th Ave Madison Ave during the day.    +Select Bus Service+  also makes limited stops like the Limited buses described above, and costs the standard $2.50 fare. They appear on the Bx12 and Bx41 in the Bronx and M15, M34 and M34A in Manhattan. They can be identified by two large blinking blue lights on the front of the bus. However, these buses operate on a very different payment system. To board these +SBS+ buses, fares must be paid before boarding by using machines on the sidewalk near a special +SBS+ bus stop which is typically quite close to the local bus stop. Follow the instructions at the machine to pay. Once the fare has been paid, a receipt will be printed; take it and keep it with you. Once the bus arrives, you can enter through any door, but remember if you paid with cash to use the front door if you will need to ask the driver for a transfer. Fare inspectors will occasionally check for your fare receipt as proof of payment; show it to them if they ask. If you dont have a valid receipt, you will be forced to pay a fine of $100 or more so it is wise to always pay the fare. However, if you cannot buy the ticket successfully, such as due to a malfunctioning machine, note the machine number and report the problem to the bus driver near the front door at once. If the +SBS+ skips your stop, wait at the local bus stop for a local bus which will arrive soon.</field>

And outside peak hours, a ride by bus from the tip of Manhattan at Battery Park to Midtown is a good and cheap way of taking in the sights.</field>

		<field name="content">All licensed taxis and sedan limousines are authorized to take 3 passengers in the backseat and 1 in the front seat for a total of 4. However, some of the newer minivan and SUV yellow cabs can seat more passengers and may take more than four passengers (even though the licensed limit is posted in the cab). Larger than sedan limousines can be reserved, also useful for airport trips with lots of luggage, by calling any of the dozens of companies in the yellow pages.  For all cabs, you must pay tolls for bridges, tunnels and highways. Be careful of being overcharged by drivers for toll crossings—on some bridges and tunnels (like the Queens-Midtown Tunnel) rates are not posted in plain view. So, a crossing which actually cost the cab driver $4 is easily passed onto the unsuspecting passenger as a $5 charge. Outside the city, other than flat fare destinations and Newark Airport, meter rates are doubled (when going to Westchester or Nassau County). Tipping your driver is expected.  Be wary of unlicensed cars (known derisively as "gypsy cabs") cruising for passengers, especially near the airports. While drivers may claim to offer you a cheaper rate than an actual taxi, your chances of actually getting this rate (not to mention getting to your destination safely and quickly) are slim.  If youre willing to negotiate and know what youre doing, you might be okay, but youre better off asking an airport staffer for help finding a cab or cabstand. Major airports have taxi information cards for passengers.  There are also bizarre van and shuttle services in different parts of the city. You will have to ask where it is going and how much it costs. Usually, you will see people lining up and some mysterious van will appear and they will board. There are services between Chinatown and Queens (you won’t have to make any transfers if it goes where you need to go!), and also there are separate services in Brooklyn, and Queens. Many of these services are branded as "Dollar Vans" (actually costing $2.00), and follow major bus routes along major avenues in these boroughs and will drop you off and pick up at any corner along the avenue. Some are legal while most arent and usually compete with each other for customers and may cut some other van drivers off. This is an accepted practice in these boroughs and at times are faster than MTA buses. The illegal vans may not have insurance so you ride at your own risk. Most drivers of these vans have heavy West Indian accent. Some may seem sketchy but for the most part are people just trying to make a living. They are usually are helpful with directions. It is rare that incidents occur with them.   In recent years, pedicabs have appeared in New York. The city is in the early stages of licensing and enforcing safety regulations for them.</field>

		<field name="content">Yellow Cabs cruise in most of Manhattan and are available at dispatcher lines at airports, but are harder to find in the other four boroughs. Real NYC taxis are yellow, have a metal seal on the hood ("medallion"), a light with a taxi number on the roof, a meter for billing, stickers on the windshield for various licenses, special taxi license plates, and a divider inside the car. The fares are $2.50 plus a $0.50 state tax to start, plus $0.40 for each 1/5 mile traveled. There is a night surcharge from 8PM to 6AM of $0.50 and a rush hour surcharge of $1 from 4PM-8PM M-F. In addition, as in the rest of the United States, tipping your taxi driver is expected in New York. For more information, see  Tipping in the United States . Info on fares, flat fares, group rides and rules are  online . All yellow cabs accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express for payment. In the unlikely event that the card reader is broken, the driver will let you know before you get into the taxi. To hail a taxi, stand visibly near the street (but away from moving traffic) with one arm raised over your head. The medallion numbers on the roof of the taxi will indicate the status of the taxi:  If the medallion number is unlit, then the taxi is already occupied and therefore unavailable.  If the medallion number is lit and the "off-duty" sign next to it is also lit, the taxi is typically not available. However, sometimes the taxi will stop for you even if the off-duty sign is lit, usually if you are going in the same direction as the taxi driver to turn the cab in after his shift. So if you are desperate, its worth a try to hail it. However, a driver may still decline your fare even after stopping if you are going a different direction than them.  If the medallion number is lit but the off-duty sign on the roof is not, then the taxi is available for hire.   Livery or Black Cars, known as car services or livery cabs, may only be called by phone, and are flat rate rather than metered. In most areas, they are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares, although sometimes they will do so anyway. Ask for the fare while on the phone. Their license plates will say either "Livery" or "TLC" on the bottom.  In some areas, livery cabs can be flagged on the street. Though this is technically illegal (the driver, not you, could get into trouble), it is useful in upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs and is accepted practice. The minimum fare in these cabs is about $7, and it is advisable to negotiate the fare before you get inside (again, tipping your driver is expected). Since yellow cabs are hard to come by in the outer boroughs, these cars are particularly useful for getting to the airport (your hotel can arrange one, or look up car services in the Yellow Pages).</field>

		<field name="content">The  Staten Island Ferry , runs from Battery Park in southern Manhattan to  Staten Island . The ferry carries passengers and bicycles only, runs every 15-20 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at most other times, and is free (so dont be fooled by con artists trying to sell "advance tickets"). Not only does the ferry provide a means of transport, but it offers an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor on its way. Even if you dont want to visit Staten Island, taking this trip is highly recommended and is very popular with tourists. Ride on the starboard side of the ferry (right side facing the front) from Manhattan and the port side from Staten Island for the best views (to the west). If you want to take good photographs, try to get on the ferry as soon as the gates open and walk briskly to an open window (few windows are open to the air and will populate quickly). The Manhattan-to-Staten Island route passes slightly closer to the Statue of Liberty than the return route.   New York Waterway , operates ferries that connect the city with the  New Jersey  Hudson River Waterfront, and with points in Brooklyn and Queens. These ferries are not free. Inquire as to fares before boarding.   New York Water Taxi  runs ferries between points within Manhattan, with some connections to Brooklyn and New Jersey. Their boats are painted to look like taxis.</field>

Be warned that car rentals in New York are generally more expensive than elsewhere in the United States, and frequently require a deposit of up to $500, if you do not have a credit card. Insurance rates also tend to be higher in New York than in most other cities.</field>

		<field name="name">points of entry</field>
		<field name="content">There are several points of entry/exit into the city from the New Jersey side: the Lincoln Tunnel (midtown/41st Street), the Holland Tunnel (downtown/Canal Street), and the George Washington Bridge (way uptown/178th Street) — all are accessible from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). I-78 east will also feed directly into the Holland Tunnel (US-1/9 is also a popular route). I-80 east will terminate at an I-95 junction, the north route of which will lead directly to the George Washington Bridge. The bridge is also directly accessible from US-46 east. With all of these options, many commuters choose to listen to 24 hour traffic reports on AM stations 880 (every ten minutes on the 8s) and 1010 (every ten minutes on the 1s) to find the least congested route at that time. Weekend traffic delays can easily exceed 60 minutes at some of the tunnels, so plan accordingly!  The Midtown Tunnel under the East River is convenient for Long Island travelers, as it becomes the Long Island Expressway.  The Queensborough Bridge (aka The 59th Street Bridge) also crosses the East River into Queens, is toll-free, and lands near the mouth of the Midtown Tunnel but requires some automotive manipulation to get onto a highway. Other routes head north and east out of the Bronx, including Interstates 87 (north to Albany) and 95 (northeast to Boston) and the Henry Hudson Parkway, which is along the Hudson River.</field>

		<field name="name">rush hour traffic</field>
		<field name="content">Traveling at off-hours makes sense to avoid rush hour traffic, but highways and roads are still generally packed any time of day. The Cross Bronx Expressway, which is part of I-95 and leads to the George Washington Bridge, is almost always choked with traffic.  The Long Island Expressway has heavy eastbound traffic between the morning and evening rushes. The Holland and Lincoln Tunnels are 10 minute waits on a good day. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) is notorious, and an accident on the Verazzano Bridge without shoulders can cause a backup all the way through the northern part of Staten Island into New Jersey. It is a good idea to check radio traffic reports, especially before crossing a bridge or tunnel. Three different stations have reports every 10 minutes around the clock: 880 AM (on the 8s), 1010 AM (on the 1s), and 1130 AM (on the 5s).  Driving cross-town (east-west) in Manhattan during rush hours is especially troublesome because the traffic lights are optimized to move traffic along the north-south roads. Your best bet is to avoid driving in Midtown Manhattan (between the 30s and 50s) whenever possible. If you do drive in Midtown Manhattan cross-town, posted  Midtown Thru Streets  may reduce delays.</field>

Commercial traffic is permitted only on roadways designated as Through and Local Truck Routes.  Commercial traffic  is prohibited on all multiple-lane roadways designated as "parkways" (such as the Grand Central Parkway, Cross-Island Parkway, or Henry Hudson Parkway) with frequent low bridges.

		<field name="name">garage parking</field>
		<field name="content">Parking in garages or outdoor lots is usually very expensive, costing as much as $40 per day in Manhattan, although cheap or free lot parking is available at some times at certain locations. Street parking can be free or much cheaper than garage or lot parking, but can be extremely hard to come by. Also, "bumping" cars in front of and behind of you to get into and out of a parking spot (known to some as "Braille Parking") is common, so if you choose to park on the street, dont be surprised if you find a few new scratches and scrapes on your bumper.  As a general rule, hotels in New York do not supply garage parking. The few that do will charge you handsomely for the privilege. To find garage parking, look at the following five websites:    ParkMe.com  is a free site and smartphone app that allows users to search and compare rates, hours of operations, and other information for every single parking facility in New York City. Users can search for their destination then get a listing of all parking facilities in the area. ParkMes rate calculator will tell you how much it costs to park at each facility based on how long you want to park.     BestParking.com  is a free service that allows users to search and compare all daily and monthly rates and locations for parking facilities in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Users can book free parking "Reservations" and "Rate Guarantees" at over 20% of Manhattans parking garages (including Icon Parking Systems and Edison ParkFast). The websites instant rate comparison clearly displays the rates on a Google map and the interface is extremely user-friendly. Regular rates, early bird specials, weekend specials, night Specials, SUV/oversize/luxury vehicle rates, motorcycle rates, and all additional posted charges are included in the instant rate comparison.    PrimoSpot.com  is a free site that allows users to find on-street (free) parking. It will calculate the amount of time you can stay in metered and alternate side of the street city parking. They provide a breakdown of the regulations and photos of the signs. There is coverage for Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Hoboken, New Jersey. Users can type in an address, intersection, or zip code and will get the regulations for that area. The parking regulations display on a Google map and the interface is easy to use. Note that PrimoSpot will only tell you how long you can stay in a parking spot in any particular zone; theres no guarantee that there will actually be an empty spot waiting for you when you arrive.    IconParking.com  is a service where you can book your parking time (if you know it) by the block, date, time, and even choose which garage. One traveler says, "Ive gone into garages that have initially said theyre full up and then I said I booked it online and they shrugged and honored it." When you book online with this company, print a confirmation and take it with you. Most times the attendants/valets will assume you know what youre talking about, but sometimes they want to see the printed confirmation. Also, when you pay, they may feign ignorance as to the price you were quoted online. This is another reason to print out the reservation. Using this service, it is possible to pay $10 on a weekday for 8 hours of parking from 10AM-6PM on John Street in the Financial district. If initially the valet says they dont have to honor that rate, be persistent and you should get it.    ParkFast.com . This site is for Edison Parkfast, the owner/manager of 40 parking locations around the city. The site isnt as feature-rich and you cant pick your hours or dates, but at least they have some basic rates and locations.</field>

		<field name="name">street parking - rules and penalties for violation</field>
		<field name="content">Check all parking signs carefully. Parking meters demand constant feeding, and are hungry late into the night in some areas. In some parts of Midtown Manhattan, there are pay-and-display meters which are only in effect from 6PM to midnight on weekdays and all day on weekends. In these areas, parking is prohibited during the workday, except for commercial trucks. It is a good idea to keep a roll of quarters in your car, as not all meters accept credit cards. Parking is permitted at broken or missing meters for the time posted on the signs. Parking is illegal at ALL bus stops and within 15 feet (4.5 m) of fire hydrants. Yellow lines on the curb have no legal meaning in NYC, so they cannot be relied upon to tell you if you are parked far enough from a hydrant. That said, in most areas the seams in the sidewalk are roughly five feet apart, so leaving at least three "squares" of sidewalk between the hydrant and your bumper is a smart move.  Many motorists simply pay garage fees to avoid the anxiety of finding a parking spot and the risks of expensive parking tickets.  New York has "alternate side of the street"  parking rules , which may require street parkers to move their cars at different times of the day (such as early morning, or overnight in a few business districts) so that street sweepers can clean the roads. Alternate side rules are suspended on many obscure holidays, while parking meters and other weekday restrictions are only suspended on a few major holidays (not even on all Federal holidays).  Trying to leave a car parked illegally for very long will often end with a $150 fine, and a vehicle illegally parked in an overcrowded place is very likely to be towed away and face a $300 fine. The New York Police Department operates  the tow pounds .</field>

		<field name="name">important rules while driving</field>
		<field name="content">Unlike other places in the United States, RIGHT TURNS ON RED IN NEW YORK CITY ARE ILLEGAL, except where otherwise posted, like a sign that reads "AFTER STOP RIGHT TURN PERMITTED ON RED". Be careful when driving as some (but not all) entrances to New York City have signs alerting motorists that it is illegal to turn on the red in New York City, and other drivers from out of town may not know this rule.  As in the rest of New York State, talking on a cell-phone (without a hands-free device) or texting while driving is illegal. Even if you do have a hands-free device, minimize your talking and prioritize driving.   There are red light cameras at 100 intersections in New York City. A camera will take a picture if you run a red light and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days. However, since the camera does not identify who is driving the vehicle, no points will be issued against your drivers license.  Some bus lanes have video cameras. A camera will take a video if you drive illegally in the bus lane other than to turn right and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days.  If there is an emergency vehicle trying to get through with its siren blaring, pull over to the side and move forward as necessary. On many one-way streets (avenues in particular), the middle lane is designated as the "FIRE LANE" so that motorists can pull over to either side lane.    Some avenues and many streets have only one-way traffic.  Thankfully, one-way streets generally alternate direction, so if your destination is down a one-way street going in the wrong direction, go another block and double-back.  A handy mnemonic is "Evens go East," meaning that, for the most part, streets with even numbers will head east, and vice-versa (in Manhattan). The best gauge to determine a one way streets direction is to check the direction parked cars face.  Be wary of your surroundings when you park your car. While NYC is a safe city for its size, its not necessarily safe for your car as well. Make it as unworthy to steal as possible.</field>

		<field name="content">Brooklyn Bridge   A word of advice about driving in New York City: dont. A car is inadvisable — street parking is practically nonexistent near crowded areas and tourist attractions, and garage parking rates range from very expensive to plain extortion. Traffic is almost always congested, parking rules are confusing, and many drivers are infamously aggressive. Public transportation options are many, and are quicker, cheaper and more pleasant. Thats why many New Yorkers, particularly in Manhattan, dont own cars. If you think of staying in a suburb and commuting to the city by car, better to do as the locals do. Drive to one of the commuter rail stations (see above) or ferry docks. Parking fees at the station, fare, and MetroCard combined are usually much cheaper than parking downtown. Many stations have secure parking areas. In Staten Island, parking near the ferry terminal and using the ferry will save you money and time.  If you do choose to drive, get a map, especially if driving outside of Manhattan. Good maps to use, if you are not driving, are the free bus maps which have each street, though the subway map can work in a pinch (also used for small boat navigation). In Queens, numbers identify not only avenues and streets, but also roads, places, crescents, and lanes, all of which might be near each other. Read the entire street sign. Outer borough highways are confusing and often narrowed to one lane, the potholes could trap an elephant, the signs are sometimes misleading, exits which should appear do not, and signs directing a highway approach drag you through miles of colorful neighborhood (in the wrong direction) before finally letting you onto the highway with a stop sign and a hands width of merge space.  Traffic in New York City roughly follows a hierarchy of precedence, which is unwise to challenge. Fire engines, ambulances, and police cruisers are given priority, followed by other public service vehicles such as buses, road crews, and sanitation trucks. Beneath them are taxi cabs and delivery trucks. Below those are other cars. Note also that driving a car with out-of-state license plates (save for perhaps Connecticut or New Jersey) will instantly mark you as an outsider, sometimes resulting in other drivers being more aggressive around you than they would with a local. Suffice it to say, driving in New York is not for the timid or emotionally fragile.  However, driving can be an exciting adventure, particularly on the parkways, with their numerous twists and turns. (Just watch out for other drivers, as noted above.) Also, since buses dont serve some of the parkways, driving or taking a taxi might be a workable option for those. Nonetheless, try to use bicycles or walk on the pedestrian trails near those parkways, where they exist; trails are less harrowing and youd probably enjoy the scenery better.</field>

		<field name="content">Cyclotouring group stopping for a lecture in Central Park  Using a  bicycle in New York City  is becoming more and more common, among New Yorkers and tourists alike. Bike paths can be found in every borough of the city, in three forms: bike lanes (road lanes specifically for bicycles), shared lanes (lanes shared between cars and bicycles), and greenways (roads solely designated to bicycles and pedestrians). Greenways are highly recommended for those wishing to go on a recreational journey, however, they are not very useful for getting around. A map of bike paths in New York City can be found  here   The city has a new bike share program, called  CitiBike . The program has 330 stations in Brooklyn and Financial District. A map can be found  here  To access a bike, first visit one of the locations and pay for a pass. 24-hour passes cost $9.95 and 7-day passes cost $25.00 (tax not included). You will receive a card and a code; enter the code into a bike, and you can use it. Be warned that after 30 minutes of use, you will be charged overtime fees. Return your bike to a station (remember to place it securely in a dock–you will be further fined if the light on the dock does not turn green) within 30 minutes to avoid this. You can take out another bike and continue your journey if necessary. Using CitiBike is not recommended if you plan on using a bike for a prolonged period of time.  Cycling in Manhattan can often be quicker than taking the subway or a taxi, but it isnt for the fainthearted. The boroughs tumultuous traffic makes biking difficult. Aggressive cab drivers, jaywalking pedestrians, potholes and debris on the roads create a cycling experience that might just as well have been taken from Dantes Inferno. If you do venture into the concrete jungle on a bike, make sure you wear a helmet and have sufficient experience in urban cycling.  Cycling in Brooklyn and The Bronx can be more rewarding, or not, depending on the neighborhood. There are few bike paths in Queens, however, the roads are bike-friendly for the most part.  Cycling is not recommended in Staten Island. It is virtually inaccessible by bicycle, with the only way to get in being the Staten Island Ferry. There are only a handful of bike paths on the entire island, mostly on the south shore. This is unfortunate, as Staten Island has beautiful displays of nature in some of its parks, most of which are accessible only on foot or by bicycle. If you are looking for scenery, by all means, take your bike with you on the ferry, but do not rely on it for transportation on the street.</field>

Almost all highways in Canada and the United States are well maintained, with amenities such as gas, food, and lodging ranging from adequate to very convenient.  If you experience an emergency that endangers your life, safety, or property, you will be able to dial 911 from a compatible cell phone on almost any major highway and reach an operator at any time.  Vehicle and medical insurance issued in either Canada or the U.S. is usually valid in the other, though the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer.  Canada and U.S. insurance coverage in Mexico is sometimes limited or not honored.  Again, the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer.    Car rental agencies are available at almost every airport.  Normally, a valid drivers license and a major credit card or cash deposit are required.  Rentals are sometimes restricted for drivers under age 25.  Many agencies offer short term insurance and additional coverage.</field>

		<field name="name">by train</field>
		<field name="content">Although it once held much of the continent together, and remains useful for local travel in many metro areas, intercity train travel now ranges from relatively convenient in the Northeast Corridor, to manageable in California and parts of southeastern Canada, to sparse in other parts of the continent.  If you prefer to travel by rail, its still possible (depending on where you go), but is slower and sometimes more expensive than air travel for long distances.  Among the areas with most frequent service is the US Northeast Corridor which links  Washington, D.C.  to  Boston  with frequent stops in intermediate cities such as  Baltimore ,  Philadelphia ,  New York City ,  New Haven , and  Providence . In Canada, the heavily-populated  Windsor-Quebec corridor  has several trains daily which compare favourably in speed to freeway travel, although the cost to put one passenger on the train often exceeds that of intercity bus or of the fuel to travel by car.  In communities off the beaten track, often the rails have simply been removed and the former rights-of-way used as bicycle, snowmobile or nature trails. There are no railways still extant on  Prince Edward Island  or the island of  Newfoundland .  Most private intercity rail carriers have abandoned passenger service as unprofitable, leaving federally-owned entities such as Amtrak (in the US) or VIA Rail (in Canada) to operate the services that remain. Short commuter train runs are often regionally or municipally operated. See  Rail travel in Canada  and  Rail travel in the United States .</field>

		<field name="content">A mammoth cruise ship stopping by Labadee  in Haiti]]  The cruise industry is a large industry in some parts of North America, and cruises to places such as  Bermuda  and the  West Indies  are readily available, as well as to parts of  Mexico . Cruises are offered as tours, and, if your travel begins or ends at a port in the United States, you generally must embark or disembark either at the same port or in a different country at the other end of the cruise. (This is due to cabotage laws.) The exception is if the line is owned and staffed by Americans, using American-built ships. (Most cruise lines are multinational operations.) Generally, cruises stop at a given port for only a few hours, so this method of travel may be inconvenient for people who want to stay longer at a port. Some locations, such as the states of  Washington  and  Alaska , have ferry service, allowing trips to various locations in or near them.</field>

There are many sidewalks and footpaths to take in less populated areas.  For the dedicated long-distance hikers the  Continental Divide Trail  and the  Pacific Crest Trail  are United States National Scenic Trails running thousands of miles between  Mexico  and  Canada  through some of the most mountainous and rugged areas of North America.</field>

The project is officially called the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor and is expected to be completed in phases through 2012 and 2019.  Some locals believe that the new rail transit will be named, TheRail, after the currently existing TheBus system. It is expected to connect the southern Leeward Coast (commonly known as the West Side, or West Oahu) with Ala Moana Shopping Center in downtown  Honolulu .</field>

		<field name="content">The following are some of the more important major highways on Oahu. Both the common name and the state route number are given here. With the exception of H-1, H-2, and H-3 locals refer to most state highways by name, rather than route number.  H-1 is an interstate freeway that runs from Kahala in East Honolulu west, through downtown Honolulu, past the airport and out to the western suburb of Kapolei where it joins Farrington Highway.  H-1 is the busiest and most heavily used freeway on Oahu.  H-2 is an interstate freeway that runs from the town of Waipahu through Mililani to the town of Wahiawa in  Central Oahu .  H-3 is an interstate freeway that runs from the suburb of Aiea, through the windward communities of Kaneohe and Kailua, to the gate of Marine Corps Base Hawaii.  Moanalua Freeway/H-201 is an interstate freeway auxiliary route that serves as an alternative route for H-1.  It runs from the Middle Street Merge (H-1, H-201) in the community of Kalihi in West Honolulu to the H-1, H-3, H-201 merge in Aiea.  Some freeway signs may still label Moanalua Freeway as Route 78, even though Route 78 has since become H-201 in 2004.  Nimitz Highway/Ala Moana Boulevard (state route 92) runs from Pearl Harbor to Waikiki; it is the main route from the airport to Waikiki.  Pali Highway (state route 61) runs from downtown Honolulu to the Windward town of Kailua.  Likelike Highway (state route 63) runs from the Kalihi district of Honolulu to the Windward town of Kaneohe.  Kalanianaole Highway (state route 72) starts from the east end of H-1 and runs through the East Honolulu suburbs around Makapuu Point, and through the rural community of Waimanalo, ending in Kailua.  Kamehameha Highway (state routes 99, 80, and 83) is the main highway on Oahu, starting from Pearl Harbor, going through the leeward communities of Aiea and Pearl City, then through Central Oahu, around the North Shore, and along the Windward coast ending at the town of Kaneohe.  Farrington Highway (state route 93) is two separate roads: the south side starts where H-1 leaves off in Kapolei and leads to the Leeward coast communities of Nanakuli, Waianae, and Makaha, ending at the south end of Kaena Point State Park.  The north side starts from Waialua on the North Shore through the community of Mokuleia to the north end of Kaena Point State Park(the road used to go around the point but the part that actually rounded the point has been closed and replaced with a nature preserve. A trail connects the two portions).  Fort Weaver Road/Kunia Road (state routes 76, 750) goes from Schofield Barracks near Wahiawa south to Ewa Beach.</field>

State Route 3 (3C Highway) runs from  Cincinnati  to  Cleveland  via  Columbus  and receives its nickname from the fact that it runs through Ohios three largest cities, all of which begin with the letter "C".  I-70 splits the state in half, linking Columbus, Dayton and Springfield beyond Pennsylvania to the east and beyond Indiana to the west.  I-71 connects the three big cities, starting in Cleveland and running southwest through Columbus and Cincinnati, then beyond Kentucky.  I-75 runs along the western part of the state, serving Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo and connecting them to Michigan to the north and beyond Kentucky to the south.  I-76 serving Akron and Youngstown and connecting to Pennsylvania to the east.  I-77 starts in Cleveland and runs south through Akron, Canton, New Philadelphia and Marietta and continues beyond West Virginia.   I-80 is the Ohio Turnpike (a toll road) that runs across the northern part of the state, serving Cleveland, Akron, Toledo and Youngstown (where I-80 and I-76 criss cross) and beyond Pennsylvania to the east and Indiana to the west.   I-90 also serves the far northern part of the state, including Cleveland and Toledo, merges with the Ohio Turnpike (I-80) for a stretch and continues beyond Pennsylvania to the east and Indiana to the west.</field>

		<field name="title">Orlando</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">The car is omnipresent in Orlando, and it is a very easy and convenient (if not congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city with most attractions lying far to the south of the CBD and into adjacent cities like  Kissimmee . The roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all major attractions well signed, but traffic jams around downtown are common in the afternoons, and around the touristy areas on Friday nights and all day Saturday. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area expressways. Traffic information is available from electronic signs over roadways, most local radio stations, and also by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info).  As with most urban areas in the U.S., there are plenty of drivers who prefer to speed and drive aggressively. The Orlando area receives over 50 million visitors each year, many who drive while in town, while home to just 2 million residents. The combination of these two types of drivers can make Orlandos roads a bit hectic at times. Speed limits in the Orlando area are higher than some parts of the U.S., with a speed limit of around 45-50mph on major roads. The speed limit on Interstate 4 and tollroads is 65mph, with urban sections close to downtown posted at 55mph. Drivers in the left lane tend to drive 5-15mph faster than the speed limit. While it is the law to keep right except to pass, this is not strictly enforced.  The main highway through Orlando, and the only interstate serving it, is Interstate 4 (commonly called "I-4") which runs diagonally from northeast to southwest across the Orlando area. In recent years major construction on it has widened it through areas south of S.R. 528 making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and Friday and Saturday evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Drive; Amway Arena; the Mall at Millenia; Arabian Nights dinner theater; and theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Discovery Cove, the Holy Land Experience, and Wet n Wild are all conveniently located along/near I-4.  Other major highways include the Beach Line Expressway (S.R. 528), a toll road known until recently as the Bee Line, which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) towards the Space Coast beaches and Kennedy Space Center,  Cocoa Beach , and Port Canaveral. S.R. 528 is, like all Orlando area expressways (which doesnt include I-4), a toll road. While tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, tolls can quickly add on long cross-town trips. Bypassing Orlando on S.R. 417 is $5.50 for 55nbsp;mi (89nbsp;km). The Central Florida GreeneWay (S.R. 417) starts at I-4 just west of SR-192/Disney World. It takes you north, passing both the Orlando International Airport and the Orlando-Sanford International Airport. It ends at I-4 in Sanford, FL. S.R. 408 starts at SR-50 on the East side of Orlando, by the University of Central Florida and takes you past the west side of Orlando to the city of Ocoee, FL. It ends at the Florida Turnpike. S.R. 429 starts in Apopka, FL at U.S. 441 and takes you past the Florida Turnpike and Disney World. It ends at I-4, just west of SR-192/Disney World. Floridas Turnpike starts in Miami, FL at I-95 and takes you north through Orlando and ends in Wildwood, FL at I-75. See this convenient toll calculator online:   .  In Orlando, the main tourism area is International Drive, a strip of road that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, and attractions are to be found along this road; therefore, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking along this road on weekends, especially in the summer and from Thanksgiving to New Years Day, and excursions to this area are best by bus during such times.  Other major roads include: U.S. 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 17/92/441...a North-South alternative to I-4), John Young Parkway (which can be an alternative to US-441), S.R. 50 (E-W route towards the CBD).  A few local laws to keep in mind: Lights on when raining. It is the law in Florida to have headlights on when it is raining. Seatbelt use is mandatory. Move over when passing stopped emergency vehicles. Florida has a so-called "Move over" law, which compels drivers to move out of the lane closest to stopped emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, fire trucks). If it is not safe to do so, drivers must slow down 20nbsp;mph below the speed limit to pass parked vehicles (this is higher than any other U.S. state with such a law, where its normally 5-15nbsp;mph below the speed limit).</field>

Operating directly within the airport are Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z Rent-a-car, L M Car Rental, National, and Thrifty; courtesy shuttles are available for transport to other rental companies.  If you arrive by air via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR-528 West to get to International Drive, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. This will require $1.75 in tolls.  Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World through the south exit to SR-417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls. Toll booths along this expressway uses open road tolling: see note above in box.</field>

Approximately 60 routes serve the metro Orlando area and costs $2 per ride (transfers included) except for the free Lymmo bus service downtown.   Lymmo Bus, 1-841-LYNX. This free service operates frequently in a circuit in downtown, from City Hall to the Centroplex and back. The Lymmo has a dedicated lane and stations with streetcar type control signals and modified buses that allow passengers to enter the bus without climbing. M-Th 6AM-10PM, F 6AM-midnight, Sa 10AM-midnight, Su 10AM-10PM.  LYNX buses of interest to visitors include routes 8, 42, 50, and 111 -- e.g., bus 8 or 42 for Universal, bus 8 for SeaWorld, and bus 50 or 111 for Disney.  Seven-day standard passes are $16.

		<field name="content">I-Ride Trolley, +1 407-248-9590,   . Along International Drive and Universal Blvd, this trolley primarily serves tourists in the attractions area, operating daily from 8am to 10:30pm.  While the service is advertised as a trolley, the trolleys are in fact modified buses traveling in traffic with many stops, which makes for a slow ride.  There are 85 stops along the main (Red) route on International Drive and 22 stops on the (Green) route that serves less congested Universal Blvd.  The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 25¢ for seniors, and free to kids younger than 12; exact change is required.  Theres an unlimited 1-day pass available for $4 per person.  One-day and multi-day passes, not sold on the bus, are available in many locations.  However, because of the very limited route coverage of I-Ride –- it goes nowhere near Disney -- the better choice for many visitors is to use LYNX buses (e.g., bus 8, 42, 50, or 111).</field>

		<field name="content">The AirVenture grounds stretch for kilometers, literally.  You will walk a lot.  There are helpful trams that run north and south parallel to the flight line, and stop near many of the main attractions. The AirVenture map lists the routes.  Cars arent allowed on the AirVenture grounds, except by certain staff.  If you can bring a bicycle, it will make travelling around much easier.  There is a bike corral about 200m from Theatre in the Woods in the direction of Camp Scholler.  However, there arent other bike corrals.  This means that you may not be able to lock your bicycle in other places; youll need to keep it with you as you explore.  For people who have a hard time walking, electric carts are available for rent from near the main gate.</field>

The centerpiece of Paducahs Artist Relocation Program, Lowertown plays host to a dozen or so art galleries of varying reputation, one of the most friendly coffee houses ever and a fine-dining fusion style restaurant.

If you miss the trolley, you can expect to be waiting for a while before the next one comes by.  This is a common complaint with the system and has been helped slightly with the splitting of Routes 7 and 8 to provide more frequent service.  One-way fare is $1.</field>

Outside of that area, the main commercial developments with chain stores are south of town at the intersection of Highway 101 and Highway 46 West, at the intersection of Niblick Road and River Road, and at the intersection of 24th Street and Highway 101.  Most of the areas vineyards are strewn along Highway 46 on both sides of town. Connoisseurs differentiate the areas wines between those along Highway 46 to the west, which has a cooler and wetter coastal climate, and Highway 46 to the east, which is hotter and drier.  The large area to the east of Highway 101 along Creston and Niblick Roads is mostly residential development.</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around Paso Robles on a bicycle is easy. The downtown area, with most of the sights and restaurants, is compact. Take a ride down Vine Street and see the restored Victorian homes. During Christmas, Vine Street is ablaze with decorations on the houses and amateur theater performances in the front yards.  During the spring and fall, you can ride to San Miguel, about seven miles up North River Road, and visit the historic Mission San Miguel Arcángel. The road meanders by the Salinas River and then crosses over to the mission in San Miguel. The mission is being restored, but as of December 2006, you can see the graveyard with old bell and the courtyard.  During the summer, you can escape Paso heat by taking Santa Rita Creek Road over the coastal range to Morro Bay, starting at Templeton, about a 30-mile ride. This is a dirt road part of the way, and a mountain-type bike is best. Ride into Morro Bay and load up on fish and chips at the bay. Paso Robles is a bike mecca for many enthusiasts throughout the year. There are many hilly and deserted roads around the area with few cars or people.</field>

The drive along the coast on State Route 1 (the Cabrillo Highway) is a beautiful, yet slow drive.</field>

		<field name="content">In addition to the Interstate highways that enter Pennsylvania and travel throughout:   The Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) is a toll freeway that is the main east-west route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with state capital Harrisburg along the way. Take note of the four tunnels through Appalachian ridges.  The Turnpikes "Northeast Extension" (I-476, also toll) reaches north from Philadelphia to Allentown and Scranton. Another tunnel is found along it.  U.S. Route 322 travels diagonally from the Philadelphia area to just below Erie. Many portions have been converted to freeway, but numerous small towns still lie directly on the way.  U.S. Route 22 is an alternative, more mountainous path west through Altoona and Johnstown to Pittsburgh.  U.S. Route 6 is a long, rural, scenic drive across Pennsylvanias "Northern Tier". Go west from the northern Poconos through the valley of Scranton and its suburbs, follow the Susquehanna River through the "Endless Mountains", spend three hours through state and national forest land, and end near Lake Erie.  U.S Route 30, also named the Lincoln Highway, is a section of the first coast-to-coast paved road in the United States. The highway is especially nice in the central part of Pennsylvania where it passes agricultural areas and is the main street of many small historic towns. Many of these towns have attempted to capitalize on their location on the Lincoln Highway by preserving original structures and opening them as visitors centers.  Interstate 80 runs east and west throughout the northern area of the state.  There also exists a wide network of state highways and municipal roads that reach into the mostly forested and farmed rural areas. The more mountainous of these areas should be traversed with caution by visitors as they can be drastically winding, narrow, or steep (or all three!) in parts.  Speed limit signs are almost exclusively posted in miles per hour, "mph". Seatbelts use is mandatory, and a second ticket and fine will be issued to those who are pulled over for speeding, etc. if not worn. Pennsylvania has not yet enacted a ban on hand-held cell phone usage while driving, as some neighboring states have, although the cities of Philadelphia, Allentown, Bethlehem, Erie, Harrisburg, and Wilkes-Barre have enacted bans.  As conditions go, Pennsylvania has two seasons according to an old joke: winter and construction. In the rural majority of the state, large snowfalls render the most minor of roads impassable, but the major thoroughfares like Interstates are comparatively well plowed and salted. Still, car travel anywhere should be done with extreme care in the winter, especially by those unfamiliar with the visited area.  Likewise, the jest rings true in the remainder of the year. Look out for occasional paving, line painting, or road widening projects on freeways that restrict travel to a single lane. Bridge repair or any major redesign may force detours that are typically marked clearly. Speed limits in work zones are always reduced and State Police will impose double fines for breaking them. Proceed carefully around PennDOT (state transportation department) crews, who are easily visible in fluorescent yellow attire.  Wild animals, most notably deer, can be a problem when driving on rural Interstates and highways.  Pennsylvania currently has an overpopulation of deer, so try to avoid them crossing the road. They are unpredictable animals and panic when scared, so stopping is usually the best option until it has cleared the road.</field>

The bus service doesnt serve the entire city, budget cuts have reduced the availability of routes, service is curt, and the routes are long and slow, but the buses are almost always on time.  Route maps are available on the bus, and the bus driver can answer simple questions about how to get to most major destinations in Pensacola.  For route planning, call the ECAT bus office ahead of time.  To board an ECAT bus, arrive at the bus stop at least ten minutes early; buses cant be flagged down.  Have your money or ticket ready, and ask for a transfer before paying; the bus driver doesnt have to give you a transfer if you forget to ask.  You receive one transfer for free, which is good for two hours; additional transfers are ten cents.  Tickets are $1.75 per adult, $1.25 for older children and students with a valid student ID, 85¢ for Medicare card holders, and free for young children; make sure to have exact change!  Unlimited day passes, seven-day passes, and thirty-day passes are available at the transit center.

Dont expect to find a cab when you need a ride, nor to hail one;  usually youll need to call the cab company, and expect a wait.  A few taxi-stands are located in downtown Pensacola (good luck finding them), and at the airport.  Rates for taxi cabs are set by city ordinance, and are as follows: $2 for the first one-ninth mile. .25¢ for each additional one-ninth mile ($2.25 per mile.) .50¢ for each bag of luggage over two bags. .50¢ for each passenger over the age of thirteen. .50¢ for trips between 9PM and 5AM. $18 per hour for waiting There is also a minimum charge of $11 for any taxi ride from the Pensacola Regional Airport, plus a $1 surcharge if the cab fare is over $11.</field>

		<field name="content">SEPTA Bus . SEPTA runs an extensive bus network in Philadelphia. Buses are a convenient (if slow) method of getting almost anywhere within the city.  On-time performance is relatively lacking especially in the suburbs, and its bound to happen to you at least once in a weekend if you take the bus heavily. Frequencies are spotty in the outer suburbs so plan ahead.  Cash fare $2.25, exact change only; tokens are $1.80 but must be bought in groups of 2, 5, or 10. Because tokens are discounted, you might want to buy tokens in bulk when given a chance; token purchases are easiest at machines located in the busiest subway stations in Center City and at some convenience stores, but unfortunately, not all stations have token machines. In Center City, bus routes will be fairly well documented on bus shelters, but in all other locations around Philadelphia, route maps and schedules will generally not be posted; in fact the stops or route markers may only be posted on a tree branch, so do your bus route research early. Seniors ride free with a Medicare Card or a Senior Citizen Transit ID Card.   Phlash Bus . Philadelphia has a seasonal (May-October) trolley bus for tourists called the Phlash.  It runs in a 20-stop East-West circuit of major tourist locations, from the Museum of Art in the West to Penns Landing in the East.  Free for kids under 5 and for senior citizens (aged 65 or more).  It is $2 per ride or $12 for a one day pass.  Look for the purple trolley bus or the winged purple blue logo.</field>

		<field name="content">SEPTA Regional Rail  regional commuter rail trains stop in Center City at underground commuter rail tunnels. The three major Center City stops, 30th Street Station, Suburban Station and Market East Station, serve most of the citys major attractions. Suburban Station is near City Hall, the shopping district, the financial district, and many cultural attractions; Market East Station connects to the Pennsylvania Convention Center, shopping at The Gallery, and the Reading Terminal Market, a famous local marketplace. Traveling within Center City is considered a "Zone 1" fare and will cost $4.75. Seniors ride for $1. Fares to other destinations are up to $10. Between Temple University, the city center stations and University City, service is generally frequent enough that you wont need a schedule. Service in other areas tends to be about every hour, with more frequent service during peak hours. The Airport Line comes every 30 minutes from about 4:30 AM to midnight 7 days a week, and Paoli/Thorndale Line and Lansdale/Doylestown Line also have half-hourly service during the day on weekdays. The lightly-used Cynwyd Line only comes Monday through Friday on an erratic, rush hour centered schedule.   New Jersey Transit RiverLINE  is a light rail line serving 20 stations between Trenton and Camden, New Jersey. The line connects with DRPAs PATCO Hi-Speed Line at Camdens Walter Rand Transportation Center. RiverLINE travels North-South along the Delaware River entirely in New Jersey. One-way fare between Trenton and Camden, NJ is $1.50. There are reduced fare options for senior citizens, children and families. Monthly passes are available. Trains come every 15 minutes during rush hours but only every 30 minutes at other times. There is no late evening service except on Saturday nights.   New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line  provides service to suburbs in New Jersey and to Atlantic City. Service patterns are somewhat uneven; be sure to check the schedule online in advance. These trains pick up passengers from the Amtrak concourse at 30th Street Station.</field>

		<field name="name">subway</field>
		<field name="content">SEPTA  operates two elevated/subway lines, and a Subway-Surface line that serve Center City Philadelphia as well as the smaller neighborhoods on the citys fringe. Cash fares are $2.25, but one can buy tokens ($1.80) in packets of two, five or 10. Seniors ride free with ID.  Broad Street (Orange) Line (BSL) — referred to by locals as the "subway" — runs North-South underneath Broad Street, the main north-south arterial. It serves Temple University, City Hall, the Sports Stadium Complex and everywhere in between. The BSL also has a "spur" called the Broad-Ridge Spur that serves Chinatown and 8th Market Sts. in Center City. Free transfers from the Broad St. Line to the Market-Frankford Line (MFL) can be made at City Hall Station (BSS) to 15 St.; a free interchange with Subway-Surface Lines can be made at the City Hall station. Transfers from a subway to a bus or from a bus to a subway cost $1.00 and must be purchased when you pay for the first leg of your trip. This transfer is also required from the 8th St. Ridge Avenue spur to the 8th MFL station.  Market-Frankford (Blue) Line — referred to by locals as the "el" — runs North-South from the Frankford Transportation Center in Northeast Philadelphia to 2nd and Markets St., then East-West between 2nd and Markets St. and 69th St. Terminal in West Philadelphia. The line runs underground beneath Market Street from 2nd to 45 Streets within Center City, Old City, and University City, and is elevated elsewhere. An interchange with the Broad-Ridge Spur is available at 8th St. Station; an interchange with SEPTAs Regional Rail is available at 11th St. to Market East Station, 15 St. to Suburban Station, and at 30 St. to the 30th St. Amtrak Station; a free interchange with the Broad St. Line is available at 15th St. Station. Free interchanges with the Subway-Surface Lines are at 13th St., 15th St., and 30th St. Stations.  Subway-Surface (Green/Trolley) Lines — referred to by locals as the "trolleys" — is actually a set of five streetcar lines: 10 (Lancaster), 11 (Woodland), 13 (Chester), 34 (Baltimore), and 36 (Elmwood). Each runs along a different avenue in West Philadelphia, but all meet at a subway portal at 40 St. and Woodland Ave. (except the 10, which joins the subway at a portal at 36th St.) to run in a streetcar subway under the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University to 30 St., then under Market St. from 30 to Juniper St, near 13 St. It shares 30th, 15th, and Juniper/13th St. stations with the MFL, but is the only subway stopping at 19th and 22nd Sts. along Market St. There is a free interchange between the lines at all three shared stations. There is no cross platform interchange because the MFL has high platforms, and the Subway-Surface has low platforms, and these have to be on the right side of the streetcar.  Norristown High Speed Line — sometimes called the Route 100, this above-ground electric single car service departs from the 69th Street terminal on the Market-Frankford Line and travels through suburbs in the main line to Norristown. Service comes about every 20 minutes, with more frequent service including express trains during peak hours. Stops are made on request only- to request a train to stop when standing on a platform (except at 69th Street, Ardmore Junction, and Norristown), it is necessary to press a button to activate a signal to stop the train. Otherwise, trains can blast through at up to 65 miles per hour, leaving you stranded. When traveling outbound from 69th Street, passengers should be prepared to pay a fare as they exit. If you are transferring to/from the another service, you can get a transfer upon boarding for $1.00. Travel on the NHSL costs $0.50 more than a standard fare - either $2.75 cash or a token or transfer plus $0.50 - but it is still cheaper (and sometimes faster) than taking regional rail. (The extra $0.50 does not apply to the One-Day Convenience or Independence Pass.)   PATCO Hi-Speed Line  operated by the Delaware River Port Authority, travels between 16th and Locust Sts. past 8th and Market Sts. in Center City Philadelphia and Lindenwold Station in Southern New Jersey. PATCO runs underground in the city and rises above ground to cross over the Delaware River on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. It then runs underground in the center of Camden, then is above ground through the rest of its trip in New Jersey. There is no free interchange between SEPTAs subways or regional rail and the PATCO service, and SEPTA passes are not valid on PATCO; a discounted round-trip transfer to SEPTA can be purchased for $3.10 extra when buying a round trip from a New Jersey station to Philadelphia. The PATCO line is the easiest way to access Camden, NJs waterfront attractions, including the New Jersey State Aquarium and the Tweeter Center at the Waterfront concert venue. Fares are based on the distance of travel. Those rates are as follows:  Lindenwold, Ashland Woodcrest Stations and Philadelphia: $3.00 Haddonfield, Westmont Collingswood Stations and Philadelphia: $2.60 Ferry Avenue (Camden) Station and Philadelphia: $2.25 Travel within PA, between Broadway and City Hall (Camden), and between PA and those two stations: $1.40 Any other trip within NJ: $1.60</field>

		<field name="name">septa one-day passes</field>
		<field name="content">Passengers who wish to use a combination of SEPTA trolley, bus and subway around downtown Philadelphia may purchase a One-Day Convenience Pass.  It costs $8 and may be purchased from the ticket booth at a SEPTA subway station.  Unlike other metropolitan transit systems, the one-day pass does not entitle the passenger to unlimited rides on the entire system and is limited to 8 rides on the day it was purchased.  That said, it effectively brings down the cost of each ride to $1 (compared to the standard fares of $1.80 to $2.25).  To use the pass, present it to the driver or station attendant at the fare gate who will punch the ride number (from 1 to 8) you have taken to indicate how many rides were used.  Transfers that require you to exit the station fare gates will be counted against the number of rides allowed by your pass.  Transfers to a bus will also be counted against your ride allowance.  The Convenience Pass is not valid on regional/commuter rail lines.  However, SEPTA also offers the Independence Pass, which is a one day pass that is valid on all modes of transit, including the regional rail lines (except to Trenton and West Trenton, which are $5 extra each way).  The  Independence Pass  costs $12 for an individual and $29 for a family. The Independence Pass does not have the 8-ride limit of the Convenience Pass.</field>

		<field name="content">Taxis are regulated by the Philadelphia Parking Authority and display a medallion license on their hood.  As a result, Go2Go does not serve Philadelphia and the surrounding area.  All taxis are metered.  Rates are $2.70 at flagfall and $2.30 per mile (1.6 km). There is also a variable gas surcharge. In July 2012 it was $1.15. For trips from the airport, a flat rate, including fuel surcharge, of $28.50 applies. An additional $1 per passenger ($3 maximum) after the first passenger will be charged on flat rate trips between the airport and Center City for those passengers over the age of 12. Tipping for good service is common.</field>

In addition, the 15 line (running along Girard Ave.) has recently been renovated and vintage trolley cars are now in use on this route. Connections to this line can be made at either the Broad Street Line or Market-Frankford Line Girard Stations; a transfer should be purchased upon boarding the trolley or entering your origin subway station for $1 to avoid paying an additional fare when making the connection. Among its other uses, the 15 line provides the only rail link to the Philadelphia Zoo. SEPTA has also been studying whether to restore trolley service on former lines, as many miles of rail are still in place.</field>

The city generally does not have any traffic problems, although it can get congested before and after school hours.  Pine County Highway 61 runs north-south and the Snake River runs east-west dividing the city into quadrants as such.  Keep in mind when finding addresses, the majority of the city is laid out in a grid based on the Snake River shoreline, dividing the city into north and south.  Main Street/County 61 is considered to be the dividing line between east and west.</field>

		<field name="content">Pittsburghs tallest skyscraper, the U.S. Steel Tower   The  Port Authority , +1 412 442-2000 (or PAT as some residents refer to it), operates bus, light rail and incline service in Pittsburgh. Bus service covers much of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County and, for the most part, is reliable and clean.  Light rail (commonly referred to as "The T") connects the south side of the city to downtown and the stadiums, but doesnt connect to many other points of interest.  Routes can be confusing, but both the Port Authoritys website and Google Maps (which is perhaps better) offer trip planners.  Google Maps also shows bus and trolley stops.  Bus stops are typically marked with a simple blue sign reading "Bus Stop" and listing route numbers and names.  Before boarding a bus or trolley, check Port Authoritys schedules (all of which are available on their website) and confirm its destination with the driver.  ;Fares: Zones: Fare varies depending on the zone you are traveling to/from.  These zones are radial, with Downtown as the center.  All bus schedules have charts detailing fare structure.  The Port Authority has  a page explaining fare structure . Base fare is $2.50, and covers destinations within Zone 1, which encompasses the city limits and a few nearby suburbs. Travel within Zone 2, which covers the outlying suburbs, is $3.75. The Free Fare Zone covers the Downtown core, offering free bus and trolley service.  This zone is bound by the rivers and, on the east, Ross and 11th Streets (however, the two "T" stations on the North Side are also included in this zone). Transfers: For an extra dollar, passengers can purchase a transfer ticket, valid for three hours to use on any other route (including the one you rode in on, a good money-saver for short trips). Reduced Fare: Children 6-11 and seniors 65+ get half off all fares and transfer fees. "T" Rush Hour Surcharge: The "T" system charges an extra 75 cents during weekday rush hours (6-9AM on inbound trips and 4-6:30PM on outbound trips).  Paying: The fare system PAT utilizes can be confusing, especially to visitors.  Most bus and all light-rail routes utilize a "pay enter/pay leave" system; If you are traveling INTO or TOWARDS Downtown ("inbound"), you pay the fare as you board the bus. If you are traveling OUT OF or AWAY from Downtown ("outbound"), the fare is paid when you reach your destination.  Further adding to the confusion, at night (after 7PM), ALL fares on all trips are paid upon boarding the bus, regardless of destination.  PAT has a  "How to Pay" page on its website .</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">With a multitude of hills and valleys, Pittsburgh is an eclectic town to travel by car for even the natives.  Very little is straightforward about Pittsburgh travel via car, but some constants help road warriors get by.  Major highways include the Parkways East, West (both Interstate 376), and North (Interstate 279). The PA Turnpike (Interstate 76) connects Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and Philadelphia while Interstate 79 provides connections to Erie in the north and Morgantown, West Virginia in the south. Other major routes include Interstate 579 (Crosstown Blvd), PA 51, PA 28, PA 837, PA 885, PA Turnpike 43 (Mon-Fayette Expressway (partially completed)), US 19, US 22, and US 30.   A trick to not getting lost in Pittsburgh is the well-kept secret of the  Belt System .  The Belt System consists of 5 color-coded routes along main roads, forming a unique system of ring routes around the City and county.  It provides a navigational aid for motorists in unfamiliar portions of the county.  These belts are long, winding circular paths which allow travelers to freely explore the city with little fear of getting truly lost.  If you are hopelessly lost and encounter a Belt sign (blue, red, yellow...), following these signs is a good way to locate a main travel artery and get back on track, as they cross most major highways.  If nothing else, the belts tend to eventually circle back on themselves and, at the very least, you will get back to where you started if you keep following them.  Routes are marked with signs showing a colored circle.    Visitors may want to be careful of the Pittsburgh left.  At traffic lights, a driver wishing to turn left will do so as soon as the light turns green, regardless of whether another vehicle has the right-of-way.  This may sound strange and even dangerous, but it actually has a useful purpose; at many intersections, there is only one lane of travel in each direction, so someone waiting to make a left turn will block the traffic behind them if they cannot make the turn.  While waiting to make a left turn at an intersection, you may find cars traveling the other direction will wait in order for you to make the left turn and keep the traffic behind you moving.  While not done as much by the younger generation, the Pittsburgh Left still has its adherents.  ;Lane Irregularities: Beware the "left only" lane: you can be driving straight down the road and suddenly the lane you are in becomes a "Left Turn Only" lane, although you did not change lanes. This is common in other cities in the right lane but not the left.  However, there is no rule for when this will happen in Pittsburgh, and it can happen in right lanes as well, so drivers tend to drift back and forth from left lane to right without signaling.  If you are new to the city keep an eye on the signs leading up to each intersection. As in Baltimore, many times there is no separate lane for parking, so driving in the right lane can mean you suddenly become stuck behind a parked car.</field>

		<field name="content">Portland is a great city for walking. Many intersections are designed with pedestrians in mind, and Portland has a lot of street life. Good mass transit also makes walking more feasible in Portland. The City of Portland Office of Transportation offers free, highly detailed  walking maps  that may be ordered online. For a scenic walk, the  Eastside Esplanade  along the Willamette River across from downtown offers lovely views of the skyline. Parts of the esplanade actually float on the water.</field>

		<field name="content">Portland — the self-proclaimed "Bicycle Capital" of the nation — is an excellent city for cycling, with a network of streets designed to be predominantly used by bicyclists. These streets, such as SE Ankeny, SE Salmon, SE Lincoln, and SE Clinton, are usually spaced about halfway between the main car thoroughfares in the grid of East Portland. The bike streets are generally signed with green "Bike Route" signs. Additionally, many major streets have striped bike lanes. Maps of bike trails can be obtained from Metros  Bike There! section . Bikes can also be taken on all buses and MAX lines. The City of Portland Office of Transportation has a  bicycle rental webpage .</field>

		<field name="content">MAX Light Rail train   Portland Streetcar   Trimet  maintains bus, streetcars, and light-rail trains throughout the Portland area.  There are four MAX Light Rail lines:  The Blue Line, which runs from  Hillsboro  east through  Beaverton  and Downtown Portland east to the Gateway Transit Center and to  Gresham . The Red Line, which runs from the Portland International Airport south to the Gateway Transit Center, west to Downtown and west on to Beaverton.  The Yellow Line, which runs from the Expo Center south to Downtown and Portland State University. The Green Line, which runs from Clackamas Town Center north to the Gateway Transit Center and west to Downtown and Portland State University.  All the lines go through the citys downtown (referred to as "Portland City Center" on Trimet), with the Red and Blue lines running east-west and overlapping on Morrison/Yamhill Streets, while the Yellow and Green lines run north-south and overlap on the Portland Transit Mall, along 5th and 6th Avenues downtown. MAX runs every 15 minutes at most stops for most of the day, with service every 30 minutes in the wee hours of the night.  There is also a vintage trolley service operating eight Sundays a year (see the  calendar ) along 5th and 6th Avenues on the Yellow/Green lines in Downtown. It is free to ride and has conductors narrating historic points of interest along the way.  In addition, Trimet maintains two  Portland Streetcar  lines: The NS (North South) Line, which runs every 14-21 minutes through the downtown area along 10th and 11th Avenues, connecting the Northwest Portland, Pearl District, Downtown, Riverplace, and South Waterfront neighborhoods, plus Portland State University. The CL (Central Loop) Line, which runs every 18-22 minutes from SW Market along 10th and 11th to the Pearl District, across the Broadway Bridge, along Broadway, Weidler, 7th, MLK and Grand to the Rose Quarter, Lloyd District, Convention Center, Central Eastside and OMSI.  It also maintains the Portland Aerial Tramway, which connects the South Waterfront to Marquam Hill (Marquam Hill is where several of Portlands hospitals are located).    A two-hour ticket that covers the entire Trimet region costs $2.50, and all-day tickets are $5.00. You can purchase a ticket at any MAX station (but be prepared for the occasional out-of-order ticket machine). On board buses, you can buy a ticket for exact change in cash only. Keep the ticket for transfers, and as proof of payment for fare inspectors. An extensive system map is available for a small cost from the Trimet store in Pioneer Square, or can be found  here .  Many of Tri-Mets buses run from Downtown to other parts of the city, though an increasing number are crosstown or local routes that do not.  Nearly all Tri-Met buses connect with MAX at one or more stations.  A number of TriMet buses are designated as having frequent service, meaning they run at least once every fifteen minutes.  These include: 4 Fessenden/Division between St. Johns and Gresham via Downtown  6 Martin Luther King Jr. between Jantzen Beach and Goose Hollow 8 Jackson Park between Downtown and Marquam Hill 9 Powell between Downtown and Powell Green Line Station 12 Barbur Blvd/Sandy Blvd between Tigard Transit Center and Parkrose Transit Center via Downtown 14 Hawthorne between Downtown and Lents Town Center  15 Belmont/NW 23rd Avenue between Gateway Transit Center and NW 23rd and Thurman 33 McLoughlin between Downtown and Oregon City  54 Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy/56 Scholls Ferry between Downtown and Beaverton Hillsdale and Scholls Ferry   72 Killingsworth/82nd Avenue between Swan Island and Clackamas TC 75 Lombard/Cesar Chavez between Pier Park and Milwaukie TC  As of September 2012, the free ride area downtown has been eliminated. You may still see some uncorrected signs referring to the free area, or to the former fare zones, but dont be misled mdash; all Trimet travel now needs a paid ticket, and all trips require a flat fare.  Crime on the Trimet system is extremely rare. Cell phone chatter (it is illegal in Oregon to use a cell phone while driving), however, is a problem.  If you have a smart phone, there are free apps to assist with trip planning and finding out when the next bus will arrive at your stop. Trimet actively encouraged developers to leverage its web resources.</field>

		<field name="content">Although public transit in Providence is almost entirely comprised of buses, the buses are on-time, reliable, and much of RIPTAs bus fleet is new. Kennedy Plaza, RIPTAs downtown bus station, has recently undergone a major overhaul and is well laid out with digital displays at each terminal that tell when the next bus will be coming.  Two of the downtown lines are run completely on natural gas trackless trolleys (called the Providence LINK Trolley), and cover most of historic Providence.  Base fare is $2.00, though e-riptiks or ride passes may be purchased either on-board or at local Shaws and Stop and Shop supermarkets. Seniors or disabled persons ride for half price during non-peak hours with the presentation of an id. Students from some local colleges can buy discounted bus passes or use their school id cards (policy varies depending on the school).</field>

Parking on Federal Hill is available but fills up fast.  There is also valet at almost every restaurant there.  Parking on Thayer Street is available but you may be going up and down the streets around it a few times before you actually find a spot.</field>

		<field name="content">Renos transit system, called RTC RIDE   , is operated by the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County   . The busiest route, the 1 bus, was recently replaced with two new services, RTC RAPID, a priority express bus making limited stops, and RTC CONNECT, the local.  RAPID runs 15 minutes or better headways most of the day through Downtown Reno (a good place to start is the RTC 4th Street Station at 4th and Lake which opened Oct 31st 2010) and down South Virginia Street (the major north-south street) to Meadowood Mall   .  RTC RAPID should serve any tourist well for most shopping, dining, and gambling needs.  Other routes to know about are the 11, which runs between downtown Reno and downtown Sparks, and the free, yellow Sierra Spirit circulator bus (7AM – 7PM), which connects various downtown destinations along the Virginia Street corridor down to the Truckee River to the south and the University of Nevada, Reno, to the north.  In downtown Reno, all buses stop at or near the RTC 4th Street Station at 4th and Lake St, where you can also find The Bus Book.  Fares may be paid on the bus by cash (exact change) or by pass.  All RTC RIDE passes are available from the Pass Vending Machines (as of March 28, 2011 all day passes are $4 at the Station, if you buy them on the bus they are $5. One trip fare is $2, but asking for a transfer allows travel on any bus in any direction for 1 1/2 hrs from the time of purchase. All major casinos have a bus stop for easy access.), available at RTC 4th Street Station and Meadowood Mall, and may be purchased with cash, coin, debit or credit cards (cash only if purchased on the bus).</field>

		<field name="content">Riverside is in Southern California and Southern Californians are slaves to the automobile. Most of the time, getting around in Riverside will involve some form of car, and traffic congestion can ruin your day, and the poor driving habits of some other drivers may make you want to pull your hair out.  The CA-60/I-215 runs along the north side of the city. (Confusingly, the two freeways merge at the Riverside 60/91/215 interchange and then split again at the Moreno Valley Interchange, which is still actually within the city limits.) The Market Street exit provides access to Downtown, the 3rd/Blaine and University exits allow easy entry into the University neighborhood, and the Martin Luther King exit will allow you run of the mostly-residential Canyon Crest area. Note that if you proceed on the CA-60 just past the interchange, get off at Day Street and youll arrive at one of two area malls, the Moreno Valley Mall. It isnt in Riverside proper, but many people shop there rather than brave city traffic to go to the Galleria at Tyler.  The CA-91 runs from its origins at the 60/215/91 interchange in the north of the city, and runs the length of Riverside, eventually extending into Corona, Orange County and terminating in Long Beach. Notable exits include University Ave., which borders Downtown, Central Ave., which is near the new, upscale Riverside Plaza, Tyler St., immediately next to the Galleria at Tyler mall, and La Sierra Ave., which is near the citys second Metrolink station, and Castle Park.  The major crosstown arteries are Arlington and Magnolia Avenues. Congestion on these streets is interminable, and travelers would be well-advised to use  other routes. Jurupa Ave. largely parallels Arlington, and Indiana and Victoria avenues parallel Magnolia. Victoria avenue is lightly-used, and is quite scenic. If youre willing to drive slightly out of your way, its well worth the extra distance to cruise among the citys old orange groves.</field>

		<field name="name">public transport</field>
		<field name="content">Once again, while the vast majority in the city do use automobiles, there is public transit available in Riverside. The Riverside Transit Agency    provides fixed-route bus service on around 15 routes in the city, as well as three express commuter services and a few new community-based trolley-bus routes. Trips up and down Magnolia Ave. on route 1, on University Ave on route 16, and on route 15 along Arlington Ave are relatively frequent, with 20, 30, and 40 minute headways, respectively. Weekends and other routes can cause more delay. But a note of warning -the entire Riverside city bus service essentially stops running at 8:00pm; with a few routes running through 10:00pm. There is simply no service at night. So if youre planning to be out late, make sure you have a way home.  One notable exception to the early evening shut-down of the transit system is the RTA 53- Bear Runner  . This line tends to have students returning home from campus late at night, but of course it is open to anyone to ride. The service runs Monday-Thursday nights from 6:00pm to 12:30am, but during the school year only (late September-early June). The loop serves the University and Canyon Crest neighbourhoods every half hour, and can be somewhat useful in returning home from a night of revelry at local eateries and drinking establishments -so long as youre staying near its route.  The Riverside bus system has two main hubs -the Downtown Terminal, and the Galleria at Tyler in the south of the city. Chances are you will have to travel to one of these transfer points to get anywhere in the city. Commuter express routes 204 and 216 stop at the Downtown Terminal with destinations of Montclair/Ontario and Orange County, and 216 and OCTA    794 stop at the Galleria, both headed towards Orange County. Local routes serve all surrounding areas.  Taxis have been known to congregate on Fairmount Ave. between the Greyhound and city bus terminals. This is helpful if you end up caught by the sudden unavailability of public transport at night. Trip planning is available on the web site, on Google Maps, and by calling 1-800-800-7821 between 7:00am and 7:00pm M-F, and 8:00am and 5:00pm weekends.</field>

		<field name="content">The highway system is designed as two loops, the unofficial "Outer Loop" and the official "Inner Loop", with feeders coming in from the west, east, and south.  (North is Lake Ontariomdash;no highways there!)  The Inner Loop is an urban expressway, weaving both above and below the surface roads of downtown.  It circumscribes the nominal downtown area, although some "downtown" attractionsmdash;Frontier Field, High Falls, and most of the museums, for examplemdash;lie outside the Inner Loop.  Because its a loop, you can get turned around if youre not familiar with the area; visitors should probably stick to surface streets.  The Inner Loop begins and ends at I-490, which runs east-west right through the middle of the city and forms the bottom portion of the actual loop.  I-490 is the feeder expressway that connects the Outer and Inner Loops on both the east and west sides of the city, eventually connecting up with Interstate 90, the New York State Thruway, on both ends (several miles out).  The Outer Loop runs very close to the official city limits.  I-390 comes up from the south (where it connects with the Thruway), then turns sharply west at a junction with I-590, which heads east.  The two spurs curve out and up to the north to form the bottom part of the loop, until they each reach I-490 on either side of the city.  Their Interstate designations end there, but the highways each continue north as State Routes 390 and 590.  390 passes State Route 104 and continues north as an expressway to the Lake Ontario State Parkway, just west of the Rochester harbor.  590 also passes Route 104, but soon becomes a surface road for the rest of its run to the lake, at Seabreeze near Irondequoit Bay.  New York State Route 104 is a major east-west route and forms the northern part of the Outer Loop, although its only an expressway on one side, from the river east.  Its also the main feeder route from the northeast and northwest.</field>

		<field name="content">While driving downtown, keep an eye out for these directional signs; theyre color-coded by quadrant and provide directions to parking and attractions.   The expressways will get you close to your destination, but navigating the surface streets is necessary as well.  Rochesters early founding as a milling village means that its major avenues were laid out to facilitate traffic to outlying and neighboring settlementsmdash;namely, in a radiating pattern.  In general, "avenues" radiate outward from downtown and "streets" connect the avenues, but this is not set in stone and there are almost as many exceptions as there are examples.  The only place its really tricky to drive is downtown.  There is a small selection of one-way streets, just few enough to confuse you when you encounter one.  There are also some turning restrictions on weekdays, especially for turning onto Main Street; watch the signs carefully.  Outside of downtown, you shouldnt have any problem navigating the surface streets.</field>

Most also have locations scattered throughout the city and surrounding towns, and they will usually come pick you up if youre coming in from, say, the Amtrak station.  Contact your preferred agency for details and locations.  Those who balk at needing a car to get anywhere in the Rochester area can at least take heart that it is a very drivable city.  A common local maxim is that the travel time between any two points in or around the city is twenty minutes.  The expressway system was designed in the 50s, when Rochesters population was booming; this growth slowed to a stop soon afterward, leaving a network of high-capacity roads that rarely see congestion.  Youll encounter some mild rush-hour slowdowns, especially on Interstates 390, 490, and 590, but visitors from more populous areas will scoff at what Rochesterians call "traffic".  Construction and severe winter weather can disrupt Rochesters normally placid roads, however.  In winter, pay close attention to traffic advisories, and if they say "no unnecessary travel"mdash;they mean it.  Most of the time, though, drive slowly and carefully and youll be fine.  It takes locals a snowfall or two to remember this every November, so be extra-cautious early in the season.  Outside of downtown, any place you want to go will have its own parking lot of some sort.  Downtown, youll find a mix of dedicated lots, street parking, public lots, and parking garages.  Most surface lots are $5/day or thereabouts, with higher prices near the Blue Cross Arena on game/concert nights.  The garages are generally priced reasonably as well.</field>

		<field name="content">The area bus system is the Regional Transit Service (RTS), run by the  Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority  (RGRTA).  While the buses are clean, efficient, comfortable, and cheap, the service has often been criticized as inconvenient.  The bus routes are designed as a hub-spoke system, optimized for travelers headed to and from downtown.  The hub is downtown, so travelers trying to get from one suburb to another often have to ride one bus all the way into the city, then another all the way back out.  The system works great for getting to the center of downtown, but the typical rider will be faced with a walk or another bus ride to get the rest of the way to his or her destination.  If the bus routes are convenient for you, though, RTS service is hard to beat, especially when the roads get slushy in winter.  Every RTS bus has a bicycle rack on front, which can provide some flexibility if youre willing to bike to a bus stop.  Fares are $1.00 per ride, or $3.00 for an all-day pass.  $14.00 gets you a 5-day pass and $56.00 allows you to ride freely for a full month.  Discounted fares are available for children and seniors (although youll need a Medicare or RTS low-fare card for the senior discount). The $1.00 fare is valid for an hour so you can change buses without paying again - however, you wont normally be given a ticket unless you ask for one, so let the driver know you plan to change.  Bus schedules are available  online  and throughout the city, especially at transit hubs and information centers.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown Rochester is very walkable, at least for eight months out of the year.  Traffic is light outside of rush hours, and crosswalks are plentiful.  The Rochester Skyway is a system of enclosed elevated walkways and underground tunnels that connect numerous buildings downtown, including hotels, office buildings, and parking garages.  Its especially useful in the winter, but the network only covers the east side of the river, and its continuity was severely disrupted by the recent closing of Midtown Plaza.  Still, it provides a relatively warm, traffic-free route around the area.  Look for the blue Skyway logo to find your way.   On the surface streets downtown, most areas are relatively safe, but be careful in the northeastern area (bounded by E. Main Street, East Avenue, the Inner Loop, and N. Clinton Avenue), especially at night.  Outside of downtown, there are a number of pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, including Park Avenue and the South Wedge, but they are not well connected to each other, or to downtown.  Safety and navigation become issues the farther out you get from tourist attractions and recreation areas.  Especially at night, youll want vehicular transportation available.  One exception to the general lack of walkability is the  Genesee Riverway Trail , an almost-completed walking and biking route along the river.  Once completed, this trail will take you from the Erie Canal on the south edge of the city all the way to Lake Ontario at the harbor.  It also connects with other trails, especially the Genesee Valley Greenway south of the city.  Outside of the city, the inner suburbs are similarly hard to walk in, but there are pockets of village-like atmospheres where walking can be pleasant, such as Twelve Corners in Brighton and the Titus-Hudson area of Irondequoit.</field>

The Genesee Riverway Trail is fully accessible for bicycles, and theyre a common sight all over the area in the summer, especially on the  Erie Canal  towpath.  The low traffic in Rochester is a boon for cyclists, allowing brave ones to take to the highways (but stay off the expressways!).  Also, as noted above, all RTS buses have bike racks mounted on the front, which can be a great convenience.</field>

		<field name="content">Most boating in Rochester is exclusively recreational in nature, but you may find it a convenient way to travel between destinations.  The Genesee River is not navigable through downtown; you can go downstream from the south (Erie Canal) as far as the Court Street Dam, or upstream from the north (Lake Ontario) as far as the Lower Falls, but the three waterfalls and the downtown area are no-go.  That still leaves some options, however.  Mooring is available at the harbor near Lake Ontario and at Brooks Landing and Corn Hill Landing between the canal and downtown.  The  Erie Canal  passes along the southern city limts, providing access from points east and west to the upper river.  Its doable, but be sure to plan for the additional transportation youll need once your boat is docked.  Note that the Erie Canal is drained every November and not refilled until the end of April.</field>

		<field name="content">Most boating in Rochester is exclusively recreational in nature, but you may find it a convenient way to travel between destinations.  The Genesee River is not navigable through most of the city, but away from downtown its workable.  You can travel south (upstream) from Lake Ontario as far as the Lower Falls.  On the south side, coming from the canal, the farthest downstream you can go is the I-490 bridge near Corn Hill Landing.  Upstream from the canal, as you enter the southern suburbs, the river valley widens out and the river takes a gently meandering course with no significant obstacles until you hit  Mount Morris , a stretch of about 35 miles.  The  Erie Canal , on the other hand, is designed for boat navigation.  A cruise from Fairport in the east to Brockport in the west (which will take about 3ndash;6 hours) can be very pleasurable, and youll only have a couple of locks and lift bridges to deal with. Note that the Erie Canal is drained every November and not refilled until the end of April.</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around Saint Marys is both straightforward and confusing at the same time.  As far as major routes go, it couldnt be simpler; Route 255 comes in from the northwest (Johnsonburg) and leaves to the south (DuBois); Route 120 comes in from the west (Ridgway) and leaves to the east (Emporium).  Where it gets tricky, however, is at the intersection in the middle of downtown where those two routes meet.  Its a triangular plot of land called the Diamond, and in addition to the two state routes, the railroad tracks, Elk Creek, and multiple local roads all pass through.  Staying on Route 255 southbound is the only straightforward path through the Diamond.  For anything else, youd be advised to take along a local for your first few attempts.  If thats not practical, then watch the signs and surrounding vehicles carefully and be prepared to go around the block and try again if you miss.  The central business district is anchored by the Diamond, extending south on South Saint Marys Street (Route 255), southeast on South Michael Street, and east on Brusselles Street (Route 120).  Businesses in the downtown area are primarily locally owned.  The major commercial strip is farther south on Route 255, along a section known as Million Dollar Highway; this is where youll find the chain restaurants, hotels, and shops.  A relatively new Wal-Mart lies just south of the city limits on Million Dollar Highway, marking the southern end of the commercial strip.  Beyond the major streets, youll want a map to get around; the terrain combined with the odd angles at intersections mean there are few right angles and a lot of dead-ends.  Fortunately, most everything a traveler needs can be found on the major roadways (including North and South Michael Street).</field>

		<field name="title">Salt Lake City</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">When navigating the city, it is important to have a knowledge of the unique and simple grid system that the city is based on. (See the description under Understand).  The city is very car-friendly due to wide, straight roads and the fact that theyre laid out in a simple grid orientation. Although the streets become much more irregular in the suburbs, the grid system maintains itself pretty well within the boundaries of the city (although the east bench makes straight grid-oriented roads impossible, evidenced by the northwest-to-southeast orientation of Foothill Boulevard). Although the grid becomes more irregular the farther away from the city center you move, the numbering system remains consistent, and even named streets have their corresponding "grid number" listed below the name of the road on the street sign. The grid system means that you can easily reach almost every major road from almost every other major road. Car travel is also simplified by the fact that only one major one-way street pair exists in the city (500 South and 600 South).  Salt Lake City is well-served by freeways, with Interstate 15 running straight north-south through the city, running straight past downtown. I-15 through the city is 10 lanes with 2 High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes (more commonly known as "carpool lanes"). I-80 briefly merges with I-15 just west of downtown, and continues west past the airport and east past the Sugarhouse neighborhood, passing a major shopping district and running through a major residential area. I-215 runs through the west part of the city, directing traffic into the city from the western neighborhoods and the northern and southern suburbs. It intersects with I-80 just west of the airport. State Route 201 (often referred to as "SR 201", the "201 freeway", "21st South Freeway", or just the "201"), heads west from I-80s southern merge point along the border with West Valley City, although it mostly serves residents looking to come into or go out of the city. The interchange where the three freeways come together on the border with South Salt Lake is known as the "Spaghetti Bowl".  Although the roads are generally wide and spacious and generously laid out in a grid pattern, the geography of the valley forces transportation to be very north-south oriented, and this can cause severe traffic congestion on all major roads. The worst traffic is seen on I-15 north into Davis County, where rush hour traffic jams are a common sight, throughout the surface roads, especially in the heart of downtown and in the central and southern parts of the city. The Legacy Parkway was recently completed into Davis County and connects with I-215 in the far northern part of the city. This has significantly alleviated traffic during rush hour going into and out of Davis County.  Utah has many drivers on its roads from many different surrounding states and various countries.  For the most part, you will find most western US drivers styles consistent with other urban and rural locations. However, Utah drivers are somewhat known for being more prone to cutting people off and aggressively changing lanes. While driving in any location, the best advice is to safely follow the flow of traffic, whether it is faster in the city or slower in the country, obey all traffic laws, and be patient and courteous to other drivers.  Utah drivers also generally know how to drive in snow, although like anywhere there are still plenty of people who dont (particularly transplants from sunnier locations).</field>

Every light rail (TRAX) station in Salt Lake City is connected by several bus routes. Only the most important routes operate during nighttime hours, Sundays, and holidays, although even nighttime routes will often end service around midnight. In winter, service to the four ski resorts located in the Cottonwood Canyons to the east, in the Wasatch Range, is provided. Standard one-way fares are $2.50. A day pass (which is good for both bus and TRAX rides) is $6.25, and most of downtown is a free fare zone for all UTA service (bus and light rail).</field>

There are three separate lines, Red, Blue and Green. The Blue Linebegins in Downtown at the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub (the bus and train station) and serves EnergySolutions Arena and Temple Square before turning south on Main Street, then continues south to Murray and  Sandy . The Green Linebegins at the airport, heads east down North Temple Street and meets up with the Blue line at the Arena, then runs alongside the Blue line until South Salt Lake where it splits off and heads into  West Valley City . The Red Lineserves the University of Utah on the east bench, coming down 400 South to Downtown before joining the Blue line, which it follows south to Murray before splitting west into West Jordan and South Jordan. Standard fares for all light rail lines are $2.50 one-way, $5 round-trip, and $6.25 for a day pass (which includes bus and light rail service). Downtown is a free fare zone for all UTA bus and light rail lines.</field>

		<field name="content">Salt Lake City offers trails and routes through the city and around the city for  bicyclists  of all ages.  It is legal to cycle on the sidewalk in all but the central blocks of the city; sidewalks tend to be wide and (except for the center of the city) with few pedestrians. State law requires sidewalk riders to signal audibly when they do overtake pedestrians.  Many of the major attractions of the city are accessible by bicycle, and it is easy and quick to get out to the zoo or the university by bike.   Several major streets offer bicycle lanes and signed shared roadways, but some of these are too narrow and can place bicyclists in the "car-door zone." In some cases it may be easier to cycle on an adjacent quieter street heading the same direction.  Navigation is easy, and if the street you are on looks too busy, there is always an alternative street to choose.  The wider streets in the city centre dont make it any easier for cyclists, as they are just taken up with extra car lanes, and are just extra lanes to get across when turning.  Roadway cyclists must follow the same traffic laws as cars.    There are some off-road paths and mountain bicycling trails, following the Jordan River south from I-80 is a well developed path, but a little desolate in parts.  City Creek Canyon is open to bicycles only some days.  The  Salt Lake City Green Bikeways Map  provides detailed bicycle route information about these routes and trails.  Bicycles are permitted on all  UTA  buses, TRAX and Frontrunner trains. All bus routes have bike racks except for the ski routes and para-transit (on-demand bus service).  Bicycle lockers may also be rented from the UTA at several stations. In addition, the Bike Transit Center at the Downtown Inter-modal hub features bike rentals and a repair shop.</field>

		<field name="content">San Antonios bus system is known as the VIA Metropolitan Transit. It also runs the downtown trolly service (actually a bus) for a small fare. Bus fares range from about $1.10 to $2.50 depending on the service with a one day $4 pass (for purchase at some retail outlets see VIAs Website under Fare information) for all routes. There are 4 different types of routes: Express, Skip, Frequent, and Metro. The Express routes usually run from the sub-urban areas (mostly Park and Rides) to downtown.Most of them run about once every 30 minutes. Skip service usually runs along the streets with high traffic, they are called Skip routes because they usually Skip bus stops that are serviced by the frequent routes. Skip routes also usually run about every 30 minutes. Frequent routes can also be found on high traffic roads and as the name implies, the stops are very frequent. Although Frequent routes come by about once every 15 minutes, it is usually faster to wait a little longer and take the skip routes if you are going a long distance,for example on San Pedro ave, it is usually quicker to wait for the 3(Skip) as opposed to the 4 (Frequent) if you wanted to get from downtown to North Star Mall. Metro service is usually found in neighborhoods around the city, frequency varies with each route, but they usually run about once an hour. Discount fares are available to children between the ages of 5 and 11, senior citizens 62 and older, Medicare recipients, persons with disabilities and students. A reduced fee ID is required for reduced fares and can be acquired from VIA Information Centers (students may get the necessary forms from their campus administration). Bus schedules and route information can be found at VIAs website   , by calling the VIA information line 210-362-2020 or for the hearing impaired at 210-362-2019, or at the San Antonio Visitor Information Center.  A bus line of interest to the visitor is line 7 SIGHTSEER SPECIAL, which runs hourly daily ($1.10 one way) and links the various museums and attractions north of downtown (e.g., Botanical Garden, Witte Museum, San Antonio Zoo, San Antonio Museum of Art) with Downtown.  There are also three (Red, Yellow, Blue) downtown Streetcar lines  , which run about every 10 minutes ($1 one way) from Alamo Plaza to the Market Square area, Alamodome, HemisFair Park, and the King William Historic area.</field>

These tracks are heavily used by Amtrak and other rail services, and theres a good chance of being hit by a train if you make a wrong turn.</field>

		<field name="name">bus</field>
		<field name="content">The  Metropolitan Transit System (MTS)  operates bus service to large portions of the county, although service in many areas is sparse and infrequent. The weakest points in the transit system are suburb-to-suburb travel and poor links between some of the individual coastal communities, both of which often require long trips to one of the transit hubs, then back out. If you will be mainly in the areas around downtown, the bus may be suitable, but service generally gets weaker the farther you are from the central area.  There is bus service every 15 minutes or so (at least on weekdays) between Downtown San Diego and a number of destinations useful to tourists. These include the Airport, the Zoo, and neighborhoods such as Hillcrest, North Park, and La Jolla (about an hour ride). There is frequent service to Sea World from the Old Town Transit Center, where the trolley stops. Service from Downtown to Coronado and Ocean Beach is about once every 30 minutes.   The fare is $2.25 for local/neighborhood routes, $2.25 for urban routes, and $2.50 for express routes. Transfers are not available. Day passes (which also include rides on the Trolley and a $2 discount on Coaster fares) cost $5. All downtown buses intersect with Broadway at some point. During the day all kinds of people will be taking the bus. At night some people might feel a little less comfortable, but generally not unsafe on the main parts of downtown. The MTS has offices in downtown, on Broadway.</field>

		<field name="content">San Diego Trolley  The  San Diego Trolley  is a light rail system operated by the MTS which mainly serves tourists and people living in the southern and eastern parts of the city that need to get to downtown areas. There are three trolley lines: blue, green, and orange. The Blue Line operates from the US-Mexico border at  San Ysidro  and runs to Downtown via  Chula Vista  and  National City . The Green Line travels from Downtown east to  Santee , via  Old Town and Mission Valley  and  SDSU . The Orange Line connects the eastern cities of  El Cajon  and  La Mesa  with Downtown (generally not as usable for tourists). Trains run from at least 5AM-12AM every day. Frequency varies, but the trolley usually runs every 15 minutes, with service reduced to every 30 minutes for late-night, weekend, and holiday service.  Standard one-way fares run from $1.25 to $3 depending on how far you travel. Day passes (which include bus service) run at $5, and there are 2, 3 and 4 day passes available. Tickets have to be purchased from the vending machines at the station before you board the train. Theres no formal system to check if youve purchased a ticket, but there are trolley guards that may come around and ask to see your ticket, and the fine is normally around $120 for not having a ticket.</field>

Many of the beach side communitys residents use bikes to get around their neighborhood because parking is tight.  The beach areas are flat and some beach cruiser rental spots can be found along the boardwalk areas in Mission/Pacific Beach.   In other parts of the city, cycling is much more difficult with numerous difficult-to-cross freeways, as well as hills, valleys and older streets, but is possible for the avid cyclist.

		<field name="content">Sandy Springs is served by MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), +1 404-848-4711,   , which operates both rapid rail and bus networks in the counties of Fulton and Dekalb.   For out-of-town visitors, MARTA is a convenient way to travel from the airport to all stations on its network. Those who need to travel alone at night, however, may be better served by taking taxis, hotel buses, or renting a car, as the system often becomes empty or rowdy at nighttime, and travel may feel unsafe to those who do not know the city. Most destination stations have Taxi service available for local trips.   The rail network is comprised of two principal lines making up a cross. One line runs north-south across the city, while the other runs east-west. The north-south line runs from a southern terminus at Hartsfield-Jackson airport through downtown and midtown Atlanta, before splitting into two branches running north, one which terminates in Sandy Springs at the North Springs station and the other which terminates at the Doraville station. The east-west line runs from an western terminal at Hamilton E. Holmes to an eastern terminal at Indian Creek. The Five Points station in downtown Atlanta is the only station where passengers may change trains between the north-south and east-west lines. Trains run from 5AM until 1AM Monday-Friday, and from 5AM until 12:30AM on weekends and holidays. Trains run on all lines every 10 minutes during peak periods, reducing to every 20 minutes on Sundays.   The bus network comprises over one hundred different bus routes, with many routes operating approximately every 20 minutes. Bus service on some lines (generally including the most popular tourist areas) runs from 5AM until 1:30AM Monday-Friday and from 5AM until 1AM on the weekends and holidays.   A single ride on MARTA costs $2. The fare includes transfers. Single use Breeze Cards are sold in vending machines at all rail stations or at RideStores at Airport. When starting the journey by bus, swipe the card at the fare post next to the driver. When starting the journey by train, swipe the car at the fare gate, your now cash depleted card will act as your transfer. When transferring to a bus, give the operator your breeze card. When transferring to a train, swipe the transfer ticket through the reader on the turnstile.   Note for Weekend Travel: MARTA has a tendency to run slower on the weekends. Typical wait times are 30 minutes for trains and up to an hour for buses. Be sure to accommodate for this.</field>

		<field name="content">If MARTA Rail does not service all the areas you need, cars are the most popular form of transport in order to get around the  city to experience various shopping, events and more.  Renting a car is recommended. Rush hour runs almost continuously but peaks 6-10AM and 3-7PM on weekdays and often results in congestion when traveling intown in the mornings and outbound in the afternoons. Downtown/Midtown and major shopping districts such as Buckhead will also get crowded on weekends. Most restaurants and shops in the area offer complimentary or low-cost valet services ($1-3 tip expected) and on the rare occasion where parking is scarce, public lots are usually nearby for a fee.

		<field name="content">Cross streets. As San Francisco streets are numbered (100 per block) from the beginning of the street, and even and odd numbers are always on opposite sides, it is best when asking directions to ask for a cross street or neighborhood name rather than relying on the address alone. For instance, addresses on Mission Street at 18th Street are in the 2200s, but one block away on Valencia at 18th, addresses are only in the 700s. This is because Mission starts at the Embarcadero, two miles farther east than Valencias start at Market Street. Local residents rely on cross streets.  Numbered streets and avenues. San Francisco has both numbered streets, in the Mission, the Castro, and SoMa, and numbered avenues in the largely residential Sunset and Richmond districts. Mixing numbered streets and avenues when asking directions may leave you miles from your destination. This can be confusing, as San Franciscans will not say "Street" or "Avenue" unless it is required to avoid ambiguity. Thus, they wont say "I live on Fifth Avenue," but will say "I live near Fifth and Geary." Street signs generally dont have "Street" or "Avenue" either; they just say "GEARY" or "MASONIC", although numbered streets and avenues do.  Multiple street grids.  One of the most confusing aspects of driving in San Francisco is the presence of multiple street grids, particularly in the downtown area where two grids intersect at an angle along Market Street.  Even more confusing are streets in the middle of the standard blocks, like New Montgomery Street.    No left turns.  Several key San Francisco arterial streets, including 19th Avenue and Market Street, do not have space for dedicated left turn lanes and therefore bear NO LEFT TURN signs at most intersections.  As a result, you will be frustrated when you drive for miles on these streets with no opportunity to turn left.  The trick, of course, is to go around the block with multiple right turns after passing ones desired street, which requires you to stay in the right lane, not the left lane.</field>

		<field name="content">Walking can be an enticing option to get from one neighborhood to another, so long as you are aware of where you are and keep your street smarts. San Francisco is a city of friendly neighborhoods, but it is also a big city so be aware of your surroundings and keep in mind the dangers that commonly accompany a city of San Franciscos size.  However, streets that often go straight up and down hills may make walking challenging when attempting the uphill portions (but provide good exercise). Driving can be difficult up and down hills but have breathtaking views. There are many stairway walks scattered throughout the city when the streets are too steep. You can find maps that include hiking trails, bikeways, and the grade pitch of all streets marked in varying colors by how steep each segment is, that can help you orient to city walks suitable to your ability and temperament, such as the downloadable map issued by the  San Francisco Bicycle Coalition .  Note that locals rarely use the designations "street" or "avenue," even when differentiating the numbered streets and avenues. Numbered roads designated "Street" are located on the east side of the city, south of Market in Downtown, Castro, Noe Valley, and Mission. Numbered roads designated "Avenue" put you in the Richmond and Sunset districts on the west side.</field>

		<field name="content">The Clipper Card was fully introduced in 2010 and is a contact-less, multi-agency fare card similar to Octopus in  Hong Kong , EZ-Link in  Singapore  and Charlie Card in  Boston . Clipper Cards can be purchased  online , at any MUNI ticket machine as well as at select retail locations around the city, especially Walgreens.  As of September 1, 2012 new cards now incur a one time $3 fee (except when purchased in online in conjunction and linked with a credit card for autoload). The cards themselves have no expiration date and can always be reloaded with cash or passes, so be sure to hang on to yours for future visits. Clipper can either be set up with pay as you go with all transfers calculated automatically, a passport (daily and weekly passes) or a monthly pass.  MUNI has also created a single use "Clipper Ticket" as the new subway turnstiles no longer accept cash. You can still pay with exact change when boarding a streetcar above ground or a bus.  If you plan on using the Cable Cars during your visit, a MUNI passport is a great value. A one day passport (either as a scratch card sold at retail locations or loaded onto a Clipper Card) costs $14 and includes Cable Cars (normally $6 a ride) as well as all other MUNI rail and bus service. Three and seven day passports are also available at $22 and $28 respectively. Keep in mind that passports are not valid on BART, ferries, Caltrain, or any regional municipal bus outside San Francisco. Youll need to load cash onto your Clipper Card if you plan on using any of these services. Without a passport, the basic Muni fare is $2 (75 cents for children under 18, seniors 65 and older and the disabled).  MUNI operates on a proof of payment basis, sometimes called an "honor system with teeth." Each fare paid is valid for 90 minutes of travel on the MUNI system (light rail, historic streetcar, or bus but not Cable Cars) including transfers and even return trips if they fall within the 90 minute limit. If youre using a Clipper Card, be sure you "touch on" at any of the readers located near the streetcar or bus door to pay your fare and start the 90 minute clock (you can board at any door as they all have readers). Likewise if you arent using a Clipper Card (and dont have a passport) and pay cash, you must board at the front door and obtain a paper transfer ticket from the driver. The MUNI Saturation Team (fare inspectors) and sometimes the SFPD randomly and frequently patrol streetcars, subway stations and buses with handheld Clipper Card readers checking for proper fare - residents who ride MUNI regularly report being checked once or twice a week. The fine for being caught without proof of payment is $200, although tourists may be issued a warning if its their first offense. Cable Cars are not included in these transfers and cost $6 per ride (one way, no transfers), or $14 per day. Before 7AM and after 9PM, seniors and disabled pay $3 for cable car rides. Muni Passports and FastPasses greatly reduce this cost, including cable cars in the regular daily, weekly or monthly fares.</field>

Muni arrival times for many lines are available at the bus/train stop (look for an overhead LED display at bus stops) or online at  NextMuni . The sites listed above integrate information from NextMuni. An unofficial site is  RescueMuni.com , which often has information on routes that are not listed officially. A portable wallet-sized map of San Francisco and all its public transit (MUNI, BART, Caltrain) is also available at stores around the city or through their website  online . Many of the citys bus stops also have posted copies of this map with the location of the stop marked, a godsend for lost pedestrians.</field>

		<field name="content">Again, this is the main system youll use when youre in the city. Muni consists of several types of trains and buses:  Streetcar at foot of Market   Muni Metro (Lines J, K, L, M, N, S and T) is a modern light rail and subway system. It connects many southern and western neighborhoods to downtown, where you can transfer to one of BARTs four downtown stations and the Caltrain terminal at 4th and King. Outside of the Market Street and Twin Peaks subways, Muni Metro operates as a surface light rail system, running in the center of the street with stops every couple of blocks (note that many of these stops are not wheelchair accessible - check the map to see which ones are). Tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines before boarding; if the stop does not have such a machine and you do not have a ticket, you must board through the front door and buy one from the driver or risk being fined by a fare inspector. MUNI Metro operates seven days a week from 4:30AM to 1:30AM. Between 1:30AM and 5AM, OWL Buses substitute for Metro service.   The Historic Streetcar F Line uses historic streetcars, in original colors from several cities in the US and   Milan ,  Italy . The line runs from Fishermans Wharf south along the waterfront Embarcadero to the ferry building at the foot of Market Street, then up Market Street on the surface to the Castro district. Board through the front door and buy tickets from the operator if you do not already have a transfer or pass.   Cablecar at Powell Market   The world-famous Cable Cars run on three lines in the steep streets between Market Street and Fishermans Wharf: the north-south Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde lines and the east-west California Street line. These cars are a fun ride, especially if you get to stand on the running board, if a bit impractical for everyday use (though residents of Nob and Russian Hills do, in fact, use them on a regular basis). The cable car is such an attraction that, especially on weekends, it takes longer to wait in line to ride up Powell Street than it does to walk the short but sloping distance.  If you want to save yourself time standing in line at the turnaround, just walk up a couple of blocks to the next stop — the conductors save a few spaces for people boarding along the way; you wont get first choice of seats, but youll save yourself a long time standing in line.  Board through any door or just grab a pole on the running boards; tickets are checked and sold by a uniformed conductor. Do not buy tickets from anyone off the car except for clearly marked ticket booths — scam artists are common.  Both diesel and electric trolley buses serve the rest of city. Board through the front door and buy tickets from or show your pass or transfer to the driver. Service ranges from a consistent two minutes on many lines leaving Market, to a more sporadic 20 minutes for buses to Treasure Island and between outlying neighborhoods. Bus delays, leading to waits of 20 to 30 minutes, are not uncommon and are a source of much grousing among locals. MUNI operates 24 hours a day / seven days a week in San Francisco although late night owl service is limited in both lines and stops.</field>

		<field name="content">These are mainly used for getting in and out of the city:  BART, the regional metro, has eight stations in San Francisco, making it a nice way to get between well-trafficked parts of the city, especially downtown and the Mission. BART gets you across the Bay to  Berkeley  and  Oakland  and to the airports of San Francisco and Oakland. BART Trains run over 107 miles (172nbsp;km) of track, serving 46 stations. BART trains operate on third rail power and accelerate to speeds approaching 80 MPH (130nbsp;km/h). BART operates seven days a week from 4AM to 12:30AM. On weekdays BART trains depart downtown San Francisco stations at two to three minute intervals. Outer stations in far outlying suburbs have a maximum wait of fifteen to twenty minutes between trains. After 12:30AM, AC Transit and other east bay transit providers provide late-night bus service, serving principal BART stations until about 6AM. BART routes are named for the two terminus stations, not by line color as denoted on the system map. For more information on BART, see the Get in section above.   Caltrain has three stops within San Francisco. Other than the 4th and King terminal in  SoMa , these are the 22nd St. Station and the Bayshore Station (off Tunnel Ave), neither of which are particularly attractive for visitors. Of interest to visitors who wish to travel outside of the city is the  Palo Alto  Station (at University Avenue), across the street from the campus of Stanford University, and  San Jose  Diridon Station. Caltrain operates fast frequent commuter rail service, seven days a week. Service generally runs from 5AM to Midnight. For more information on Caltrain, see the Get in section above.</field>

		<field name="content">San Francisco Rail Systems  San Francisco has one of the most comprehensive public transportation systems in the United States—arguably the most comprehensive system west of Chicago—and is expanding its network with a regional transportation hub in SoMa and a new subway line going under downtown. Transport services within San Francisco are provided by several bodies, but transferring between them is easy now with a Clipper Card. Clipper is accepted on essentially every transit system youll encounter:   Muni , +1 415 701-2311 — Subway, streetcars, buses, and cable cars within San Francisco proper. This is the main public transit system youll use for getting around in San Francisco. BART — Regional train services in the San Francisco Bay Area. Youll mainly use this to get in and out of San Francisco, but you may use it, for example, to get between downtown and the Mission. It overlaps with Muni along Market Street downtown. When you enter one of the stations downtown, be sure you get on the right system—either Muni or BART—for where youre trying to go. If not, youll need to exit and beg the toll operators in the booths to refund your fare. Caltrain — Commuter rail services to San Jose and cities in between, like Palo Alto (where Stanford University is located).

		<field name="content">If you have strong legs and can tolerate traffic with intermittent bike lanes, bicycles can be a convenient form of transportation in San Francisco. Although its dense, San Francisco is fairly small in land area—just 7x7 miles from north to south and east to west—so its fairly quick to get from one end to the other. But much of the terrain is hilly and hard to pedal up. Do not be misled by maps depicting the citys strict, regular street grid, as even the straightest of San Franciscos streets might include steep hills or even staircases instead of a roadway. San Franciscans who bike frequently find ways to "wiggle" — taking winding routes to avoid hills — around the steepest hills in the city. You might try using this  flat route finder . You can also put your bike on the front of the MUNI buses if you get desperate.  A classic and relatively easy ride is from the tip of Golden Gate Parks panhandle in the Haight, along paths and JFK Drive through the park to Ocean Beach. JFK Drive is lightly trafficked, and closed to cars on Sundays.   Downtown, SoMa, and the Sunset, and Richmond districts are relatively flat. There are a number of bike paths and bike routes on city streets; the  San Francisco Bike Coalition  keeps a lot of information about them. There are a number of bike rental companies in town, including  Dylans Bike Rental ,  Bay City Bike ,  Bike and Roll  and  Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals  with locations in Fishermans Wharf, and the  Bike Hut  and  Pacific Bicycle  in SoMa.  The Golden Gate Bridge has sectioned off pathways on each side for pedestrians and bicyclists. If you choose to ride a bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge, be aware that walkers always stay on the east side of the bridge and bikes are often to ride on the west (ocean) side of the bridge. When the Bridge is closed to pedestrians during nighttime, you may continue to bicycle across by stopping to press the buzzer at the automatically closed gates to be buzzed in and out. It is a pet peeve of many locals to have to dodge bicycles while jogging or strolling.</field>

		<field name="content">Taxis in San Francisco are, for a large city, surprisingly inefficient and expensive, starting at $3.10 just for getting in the door. You can get an idea of how much particular taxi trips cost in San Francisco using the  San Francisco Taxicab Commissions webpage .   Except for near downtown business hotels, tourist destinations, and nightlife areas, taxis can be hard to find and hail—and calling for a cab can mean a 30-45 minute wait, if the cab shows up at all. In recent years, there has been considerable controversy in San Francisco about increasing the number of taxis, but the situation is getting better. Before coming to San Francisco, you should download apps for some popular alternatives to hailing a taxi (e.g. Uber, Sidecar, Lyft, and the taxi hailing app).  If you are heading to the airport, your best bet is to call ahead with a specific pickup time to one of the many taxi companies. You will also want to schedule your cab ahead of time because if you are going beyond 15 miles, you will end up paying 50% extra.</field>

		<field name="content">You almost certainly dont want to rent a car. Perpetually-clogged traffic, steep hills, a confusing system of one-way streets downtown, expensive parking, and a fleet of parking control officers who enforce parking laws with zeal can make driving in San Francisco extremely frustrating; visitors to the city should seriously consider alternatives to driving when possible. Car rental is expensive, registration fees are the highest of any U.S. state, and because collisions are common, rates for liability insurance (legally required) are high as well. In addition, traffic from the Golden Gate Bridge uses surface streets either along CA-1, 19th Avenue or US-101 on Lombard and Van Ness. In short, a car is really only useful for visiting destinations outside of the city, and even then you may be better off using a taxi or other car sharing service.  The most difficult problem with your car in San Francisco will be parking. Parking throughout the city is extremely scarce. Garages, where they are available, are quite expensive ($20–30/day downtown), and San Francisco has recently begun a variable-pricing scheme which makes the most popular street parking more expensive. San Francisco has some of the strictest parking laws and enforcement in the country.  For day trips into the city, consider a park-and-ride at a  Peninsula  Caltrain station, at a  Peninsula  BART station, or at an  East Bay  BART station.  When parking on a hill (and there are many of them in San Francisco), remember to always apply that parking brake and turn your wheels so that the car will roll into the sidewalk instead of the street if the brakes give out (i.e., when facing uphill, turn toward the street; when facing downhill, turn toward the curb). Failure to park properly doesnt just run the risk of having your car roll downhill, but it is also against the law and you may be ticketed.  Motorcycles and scooters are a common sight on San Francisco streets; in fact, San Francisco is known as one of the most motorcycle-friendly places in the U.S. Street parking for motorcycles is plentiful and relatively inexpensive ($0.30 to $0.80 an hour), but note that parking on sidewalks is usually illegal. There are several motorcycle rental shops, along with many dealers, service shops, and motorcyclist hangouts. As elsewhere in California, motorcyclists must wear helmets. Motorcycle theft is a problem; always use a disk lock or secure your bike to a stationary object using a cable or chain.   Segways are somewhat popular among tourists. If youd like to blend in, youll definitely avoid them. So far there is only one authorized Segway dealer that rents out  Segways , though various tour operators (many of whom operate from  Fishermans Wharf ) offer guided trips throughout the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Posted speed limits are enforced by local police, who will remind you why you have come to Floridas islands.  Most roads will have limits of 35 MPH or less, through both residential areas and protected wildlife zones. Beware of the infamous double stop signs of Sanibel. They are posted like that because they are often missed. Be particularly careful to mind the speed limit at night. There are not many roads on the Island and at night there is virtually always someone watching them. Watch for pedestrians and cyclists.  On the eastern half of the island, the main road through the city is Periwinkle Way.  A variety of side streets connect this road with the beaches, shops, restaurants, and lodging on the island.  On the western half of the island, the main road is Sanibel-Captiva Road, or "San-Cap".  Fewer roads connect to this one, which is bordered by protected lands on both sides for much of its length. At the end of San-Cap where the two islands meet at Blind Pass, this area is called "Santiva", a portmanteau of Sanibel and Captiva.  Running parallel to both these roads, along the southern shore of the island, is Gulf Drive.</field>

		<field name="content">There are 22 miles of cycling paths on Sanibel.  With no hills to speak of, cycling can be a rewarding way to see the island.  However, shops are located more than two miles from most lodging locations. It is recommended to rent a vehicle, since riding past sunset is impossible as there are no street lights on Sanibel. Numerous local businesses rent bicycles, and some hotels/inns have bikes for their guests to use without charge.  When setting off on a bicycle, remember to bring along water and sunscreen, and to obey all traffic laws.</field>

		<field name="content">Bringing a car on the ferry is a popular option for exploring the remote areas of the main islands, but car rentals are also available in such areas as Eastsound.  Other smaller islands may have unimproved county roads, but due to their remote locations and lack of ferry service these roads often serve as foot trails and you are more likely to see someone traveling by horse than car.  The lines for loading cars onto Washington State Ferries can be notoriously brutal during peak season and weekends.  It is not unusual to wait in line for many hours and missing the last ferry can mean a desperate search for unplanned accommodations to spend an unplanned night on the islands so plan accordingly.</field>

Small towns and harbors are geared towards visiting boaters and many of the areas most scenic and remote areas can only be reached by boat.  The area waters are reasonably protected even in storms off the Pacific, but due to the many underwater hazards some boating experience is helpful.</field>

		<field name="content">The winding paved roads of the main islands are ideal for exploring by bike and bike rentals are available near many areas in the San Juan Islands, however the smaller more remote islands often do not have paved roads making traveling by bike more of a challenge.  Bicyclists have priority boarding on Washington State Ferries so bikes can bypass the sometimes ridiculously long car lines and walk right onto the ferries.</field>

Thick forests of majestic pine and deciduous trees and hundreds of creeks and estuaries dot the coastline.  Some camping areas in the various state parks in the area are only open to people powered vessels.</field>

Many trails dot the various islands and state parks giving travelers an insightful view of their surroundings.  Outside of the four main islands cars are more of an impractical luxury item rather than a means of transport.  Many of the dirt roads see far more foot traffic than car traffic and basically serve as wide foot trails.</field>

		<field name="content">Travel in most American cities, especially outside of major metro areas, is primarily by private vehicle.  Parking is almost always abundant and free.  (There are a few lots close to the city square where the owners tow aggressively; be sure to watch for parking signs.) The average tourist would be well-advised to rent a car from a rental agency if they dont already have their own vehicle.  Traffic is usually light.    Take caution at some low water bridges.  Never drive through a flooded low water crossing.  Even a couple of inches of water can wash your car into the river.  You then stand a good chance of losing your life.</field>

Pennsylvania routes 1115 merge north of Harrisburg and serve as the main transportation artery for central Pennsylvania. Most of Shamokin Dams shopping district lies along Rtes 11 and 15. South of Shamokin Dam, 11/15 South connects with Rte 322, Interstates 81, 83 and eventually, the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Harrisburg Area) west to Pittsburgh and east to Philadelphia.  One area challenge for drivers is that on Fridays and holiday weekends the traffic backs up and slows on Rte 11. Early morning travel can avoid the problem. Additionally, Rte 11 along the river towards Northumberland, is often closed when there is flooding. Those seeking to access Route 80 can use Route 15 to connect by traveling a few miles north of Lewisburg. This drive is a four lane highway with some red lights in the Lewisburg area.</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">While there is some public transportation in Sioux Falls and taxis are generally available, the easiest way to get around the city is by car.  Roads are generally well-maintained (with the occasional summer road construction) and traffic is quite light by typical North American standards, especially considering the exponential growth of the city.  As mentioned above, Sioux Falls is located at the intersection of I-29 and I-90.  Another interstate, I-229, runs from the southwest to northeast corner of the city, meaning that the vast majority of Sioux Falls is accessible via an interstate.  Most of the major attractions, shopping areas, and dining establishments are located near two major east-west roads - 12th Street and 41st Street.  Minnesota Avenue also has a large selection of restaurants and shopping places.</field>

If you get lost or lose your bearings, remember that the main county roads running East-West are named after Presidents and other famous figures (but mostly Presidents) and begin, alphabetically, with Adams Rd. in the North near Michigan and end with Taylor in the South, near Marshall County.  North-South roads are named for trees, beginning with Ash (called West County Line Rd. on the Elkhart County side of the road) in Eastern St. Joseph County and ending with Redwood in the West.  There are expections to this rule, however, such as Washington St. downtown, and Mishawaka has numbered streets.  Also, Lincoln Way is renamed LaSalle Ave. in downtown South Bend between Ironwood Dr. and Laffeyette Blvd.</field>

		<field name="name">freeway system</field>
		<field name="content">The freeway naming conventions can be confusing to non-natives as a freeway will have multiple names depending on where in Southern California a particular section is located.  When referring to a particular freeway by number, it is prefixed by the word "the".  For example, Interstate 5 is referred to as "the 5" and State Route 91 is referred to as "the 91".  Below is a basic guide to the various ways a particular freeway may be referenced.   Interstate 5 - the Golden State  Interstate 10 - the Santa Monica Freeway (western portions), the San Bernardino Freeway (eastern portions)  Interstate 105 - the Century Freeway  Interstate 110 - the Harbor Freeway  Interstate 210 - the Foothill Freeway  Interstate 405 - the San Diego Freeway  Interstate 710 - the Long Beach freeway (southern portions), the Pasadena Freeway (northern portions)   US Route 101 - the Hollywood Freeway (eastern portions), the Ventura Freeway (western portions)   State Route 14 - the Antelope Valley Freeway  State Route 22 - Garden Grove Freeway  State Route 60 - Pomona Freeway  State Route 91 - the Artesia Freeway (western portions), the Riverside Freeway (eastern portions)  State Route 170 - the Hollywood Freeway (note: the 170 intersects with the 101 near Hollywood thus sharing a name with the 101.)  There are a few key locations that are referred to in traffic reports that may be unfamiliar to out-of-town visitors.   The Sepulveda Pass - refers to the 405 between  Santa Monica  and  Van Nuys .  The El Toro Y (or Wye) - the intersection of the 5 and 405 near  Irvine  in  Orange County .  The Orange Crush - the intersection of the 5, 22, and 57 in the city of  Orange .  The Grapevine - the 5 as it climbs over the pass between the Los Angeles Basin and the Central Valley of California.  The Cajon Pass (pronounced cuh-hone) - the 15 as it climbs the pass between  San Bernardino  and the High Desert city of  Victorville .</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Most Southern Californians drive their personal cars to get around.  Just listen to the morning and evening traffic reports and youll get an idea of how many cars are driven in the area each and every day.  As such, a special vocabulary has developed surrounding the road system.  Rush hour - somewhat of a misleading name as the period lasts longer than one hour.  Indicates the hours of 6AM-8AM and 5PM-7PM when the highest volume of commuters are on the road.  SigAlert - heard during a traffic report, indicates a long-lasting problem that closes one or more lanes.  The metropolitan regions of Southern California consist of many small cities that run into one another.  It can be confusing and you can get lost very easily if you do not have a map, even with detailed directions.  A Thomas Guide, which contains detailed maps of all neighborhoods, is a useful tool if you plan on doing any driving in Southern California.  This book can be found in local stores and bookstores.  The freeways and highways are one of the major trademarks of the region. Extensive and complex freeway networks criss-cross the quickly-growing region, connecting urban centers with their suburbs, as well as the areas of urban sprawl between them. The major highways leading in and out of Southern California include Interstates 5,8,10,15,40, the Golden State, San Diego, Ocean Beach, Mission Valley, Santa Monica, Corona and Mojave Freeways.</field>

They  have the largest federal stimulus project in L.A. County: the Harry Bridges reconstruction project. This will be a big commitment consisting of 250 construction jobs for a $25 million project. They also just kicked off a six-year expansion to the China Shipping Terminal which will include new wharfs, new cranes, and about 4,000 jobs at full capacity.  Mass transit is available throughout the area, with many connecting together at shared stops.  The regional commuter train,MetroLink   , connects many of the outreaching areas, where many commuters live, with Los Angeles and Orange County, where they work.  This train system comes in handy when you need to get from one area to another, even with their limited schedule.</field>

		<field name="content">Five College buses run between Mount Holyoke, Amherst, UMASS, Hampshire and Smith. While the service is nominally free only to Five College students, IDs are rarely checked and anyone who appears to be college-aged will likely be able to ride for free. If traveling to Smith you may need to change buses at Hampshire; be sure to pick up a schedule at the Mount Holyoke campus center beforehand.  Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) buses provide fixed service to other areas of the Valley.  Peter Pan buses travel from South Hadley Center to most major cities, but you may need to change buses several times during your trip. Tickets can be purchased at Crazy Moon Fashions in South Hadley Center. Be advised that unlike the Five College buses, you will need to show a student ID to get the student rate on Peter Pan bus tickets.</field>

Public Transit is a great way to get to meet the people of a city. Bus route maps can be found in a few stores and gas stations. Most drivers are very friendly and helpful so ask any questions you may have.  Beginning December 4, 2006 STA will be moving to a new farebox and adding 2 hour and all day passes. With the new fare boxes you must ask the driver for a pass before you put your fare in the fare box.</field>

		<field name="content">Car rentals are available in many locations, mainly near the Spokane International Airport. All the major companies are located there. Returning cars at the airport can be a little confusing. The main entrance to the rental return is an entire mile before the airport terminal (left at Flint Rd.) You can also drop off passengers and turn right at Flint Rd. just past the terminal. Note there are no directional signs for rental cars between these two places.   Interstate 90 is an excellent way to cross town East-West. A north-south freeway is under construction, and wont be finished for years. Allow more time if you have to go very far in this direction, as theres no express route yet. (The construction itself is unlikely to cause you any delays, as its not on the main roadways.)  Be aware of Spokanes many uncontrolled intersections in older residential neighborhoods. Watch for cross traffic and yield as necessary.  Check with Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for current driving conditions.</field>

		<field name="content">Monroe Street Dam on the Spokane River  Spokane is located in a valley, bicycling around can be challenging due to the hills. This can be complicated by weather, which can be cold and snowy in winter and hot and dry in the summer.  It is suggested that bikers avoid Division as it is the main thoroughfare.  There are other options available with more space, less traffic and slower speeds.  There are multiple bike clubs (road and off-road) in the area.  Some sections of the city have bike trails along arterials.  The Centennial Trail (http://www.spokanecentennialtrail.org/Default.aspx) is 60 miles long and runs along the Spokane River from Higgins Point about 8 miles west of downtown Coeur dAlene, Idaho through the City of Spokane Valley and downtown Spokane, ending near the Spokan House in Nine Mile Falls. The 37.5 miles (30 of which are class 1)of trail in Washington are blacktopped and usually in good repair, although care should be taken in spring if the river has risen; much of the trail follows the contours of the Spokane River.  It is excellent for bicycling, rollerblading, or walking; no motorized vehicles or horses allowed, pets must be on leash.  Parts of the trail, especially in Spokane Valley, run adjacent or on the shoulder of roads.  Caution should be taken not to leave valuables visible in cars if using a trailhead.  Sections of the trail are isolated by hills, forest, the river and other natural features.  There are multiple trailheads, some with outhouses.  Take your own drinking water, although there are fountains in parks along the trail (and at least one pump near the stateline in Idaho). The trail is relatively flat, but has some nice hills west of downtown Spokane.</field>

		<field name="content">St. Louis is one of the more segregated and boundaried cities in the nation, and is home to the countrys first private gated street - Benton Place in Lafayette Square. In one minute you might be driving down tree-lined avenues with large houses, and the next minute you might be in a low-income neighborhood. Though the region is now more racially and economically integrated than it was, the road system still follows historic boundaries marking one area from the next. Hotels and most St. Louis guide books should have good maps of the layout of the neighborhoods of the City.   Note that St. Louis City is separate and distinct from St. Louis County - the City is really a city without a county, with its own government, school system, and other services. The City has just under 400,000 residents while the St. Louis County has just over 1,000,000 residents. The entire St. Louis metropolitan region has approximately 3,000,000 residents. Any study of St. Louis neighborhoods can be complicated and is bound to leave out some small (yet distinct) areas, but some of the more well-visited and larger neighborhoods in the metropolitan region are:  St. Louis City Downtown - The Central Business District of St. Louis, downtown is nearing the end of a decade-long multi-billion dollar revitalization. Featuring all three professional sporting teams stadiums, dozens of hotels, corporate headquarters, trendy dining and shopping, entertainment, nightlife, and the Gateway arch, downtown St. Louis is now also home to tens of thousands of residents, many living in warehouses that have been converted to affordable and luxurious apartments and condominiums. Lacledes Landing - On the citys eastern edge, this is one of the oldest standing neighborhoods of the city. A former industrial area, the Landing has original cobblestone streets, horse drawn carriage rides in the evenings, live music, and restaurants and bars in converted industrial buildings.  Soulard - To the immediate southwest of downtown lies St. Louiss oldest neighborhood. Today it is a perfect case study for traditional St. Louis red brick architecture, and also features the famous Soulard Farmers Market and many trendy restaurants. Lafayette Square - Although some may group this with Soulard due to proximity, Lafayette Square features its own distinct architecture (Victorian and French Second Empire) and demographics. Surrounding the oldest park in St. Louis are tree-lined streets with rehabbed townhouses, some shopping and dining, and bed and breakfasts. Old North Saint Louis - just north of Downtown, the historic Old North neighborhood is in the midst of a dramatic revitalization that includes a significant number of historically rehabilitated brick, 19th Century structures; new businesses, such as Old North Grocery Co-op, Therapy Boutique, and La Mancha Coffeehouse; and a diverse community of residents, with a population that grew by 28% since 2000. The center of the neighborhood is at St. Louis Avenue N. 14th Street, which is where the legendary Crown Candy Kitchen is located, along with the award-winning Crown Square, the recently completed $35 million redevelopment of the former 14th Street Pedestrian Mall.  Crown Square is also the site of the North City Farmers Market, which in 2010 was identified as one of "Americas Favorite Farmers Markets," according to  American Farmland Trust.  Benton Park/Brewery - Located just south of Soulard, Benton Park has recently come back from decades of disrepair. The area contains the Anheuser Busch Brewery and the old Lemp Brewery, in addition to a small eponymous park and working-class versions of the townhomes of Lafayette Square. Forest Park Southeast - Situated just where the name suggests, Forest Park Southeast is at the beginning of a revitalization. Younger professionals have been attracted to the area due to the popular bars, and have since settled down and contributed to the areas infrastructure.  Grand Center/Midtown - Located going West of Downtown down an area known as the Central Corridor (that includes Forest Park and the CWE), Grand Center is home to a booming performing arts, theatre, and museum district. St. Louis University is in this area. Tower Grove/South Grand - a few miles south of Grand Center is Tower Grove Park, a 19th-century Victorian walking park. The nearby South Grand strip has a variety of shops, coffeehouses, bars, service businesses, and the areas largest concentration of Asian restaurants and shops. An ethnically diverse, gay-friendly area with an active street life and turn-of-the-century architecture. Central West End - A very cosmpolitan neighborhood featuring stunning turn-of-the-century palace-like homes, upscale dining, and boutique shopping, the Central West End also contains an eclectic mix of antique shops, coffee houses, and art galleries. Located on the eastern edge of Forest Park, it also includes the world-renowned Medical School of Washington University. The Hill - St. Louiss Little Italy is home to a large number of locally renowned Italian restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores. Its name is due to its proximity to the highest point of the city. North St. Louis -  The historic African-American neighborhood known as "The Ville", and contains many historical sites relating to the history of Black America in the Midwest,i.e. Sumner High School and  Homer G. Phillips Hospital.  This area extends from Delmar to I-270 and contains much of the industrial record of St. Louis and the migration of new comers to the city.  St. Louis County Clayton - The county seat of St. Louis county, Clayton has an important downtown business district that is also home to several hotels, many coffeehouses, and upscale dining. It is one of the older suburbs of St. Louis, and has many large 100 year-old-homes wonderfully preserved by old-monied families, while the areas nouveau riche help keep the area trendy. It has a great school system and is home to the main campus of Washington University.  Clayton begins where Forest Park ends on the west. Delmar Loop/University City - Located just north of Clayton and beginning at the northwest edge of Forest Park/Washington University is this culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse neighborhood of St. Louis. One of the more liberal areas of the region, it is a popular area for college students and post-graduates to live and interact. "The Loop" (a.k.a. Delmar Blvd) itself is one main street of storefronts, restaurants,hotels, music venues, bookstores, and one of  greatest independent movie theatre- The Tivoli. West County - This expansive, largely undefined region of St. Louis includes most areas west of Clayton, especially upper-class neighborhoods like Frontenac, Ladue, Huntleigh, Town and Country, and Creve Coeur.  The area may include expanded development of older areas such as Chesterfield and Wildwood. The area has one of the highest concentrations of wealth in the Midwest, and home to two of the most upscale shopping areas in St. Louis Region- Plaza Frontenac and The Galleria-Brentwood Square. North County-Home to Lambert International Airport and the sight of many historical flights by Charles Lindbergh and Boeing.  This area is also the home of post WWII home development and contains many small subdivisons of ranch style homes of ethnically diverse populations. South County - A nebulous region primarily served by I-55,I-44 and I-64 in a triangle of interstates, most of the towns dotting South County are largely indistinguishable and include some  new developments. It is home to Affton, Bayless, Brentwood, Webster Groves, Maplewood, Richmond Heights, Crestwood and other picture-perfect kinds of towns that provide a nice small-town atmosphere great for families. It is home to a popular shopping area in St. Louis Region- The appropriately named "South County Mall".</field>

Instead there are "Circles" which are one way roundabouts where multiple streets intersect. They are numbered  1 through 11, and there is no circle 8 (if a local tells you to go to circle 8, hes just picking on the tourists). Without specific step by step directions finding your destination can be tricky. There are free maps available at many local business as well as both the entrances to Sunriver from Highway 97.</field>

		<field name="content">Another alternative to driving is to get around Syracuse by bicycle, most of the downtown area is relatively flat but keep in mind that the University area has many steep hills and the residential areas surrounding downtown have quite a few hills as well. What some people will do is catch a ride on the bus downtown, placing their bike on the bike rack on the front of the bus and then use their bike once they reach downtown thus avoiding the steep hills.</field>

		<field name="content">While taking a little longer than driving in a car the  Centro Bus System  does provide a fair alternative to most locations in and around Syracuse. It usually costs $2 with the exception of a few routes where it is $3 or $4; if you have to transfer to another bus to get to your destination be sure to ask the bus driver for a transfer card so that you dont get stuck paying double fares for the same trip. In addition, there are 7 and 30 Day Unlimited Ride Passes and Centro Debit Cards as alternatives to the cash fare. There are also discounts for senior citizens, persons with disabilities and children.  The buses are accessible to people with disabilities and the bus drivers are instructed to let a person with a physical disability on before letting other passengers on.</field>

It will usually take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes for a taxi to come pick you up but it can be useful if you missed the last bus of the day. At the airport there is usually no wait, as there is a well-frequented taxi stand at the end of Terminal A.</field>

		<field name="content">Car rentals are the most convenient for of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times.  The main freeways in Tampa are Interstate 275, Interstate 4, the Veterans Expressway (toll FL 589), and the Leroy Selmon Crosstown Expressway (toll FL 618). Some of the main east-west roads through town are Kennedy Boulevard (SR 60), Gandy Boulevard (SR 694), Hillsborough Avenue (US 92) and Fowler Avenue (SR 582), while some of the north-south roads are Dale Mabry Highway (US 92) and Florida/Nebraska Avenue (US 41). Traffic is especially bad during the rush hours: from about 7:30 to 9:30 AM and 3:30PM to 7:30PM. During these times, try especially to avoid I-275, especially between I-4 and SR 60 (by the airport) as this section runs by downtown and is currently being rebuilt.</field>

There are four types of routes offered: "local", "Commuter Express", "MetroRapid" (Bus Rapid Transit), and Trollies (see below). Local routes are ones which have many stops in a small region. Commuter Express lines are long-distance lines namely providing service from suburbs into Tampa. Only local to local commuter express to local transfers are allowed. Fares are $1.75 for local routes and $2.75 for commuter express lines. Four small routes (83, 87, 88, 89) have a 50¢ fare with no transfers. Riders over 65, 17 and under, on Medicare, or disabled are half-price: 85¢ for "local" routes and $1.35 for "commuter express" routes. Bus transportation in the Tampa area is not popular and one can expect plenty of room in busses.    Tampa streetcars   PSTA, offers service in Pinellas County (the county west of Tampa Bay, home to Clearwater and St. Petersburg) similar to what HART offers in Hillsborough.</field>

		<field name="content">Tampa also has the  TECO Line Streetcar  that runs from Whiting and Franklin Streets downtown to Centennial Park in Ybor City with 9 stops along the way (11 total stops). The line is useful for tourists and convention goers. The line runs by many local shops, restaurants, and attractions including the convention center/ Embassy Suites, the Tampa Bay Times Forum, Channelside, the Florida Aquarium, and through Ybor City. There are 3 types of streetcars in operation: 9 "Birney Safety" replicas (picture, right), one "Breezer" open-air replica (picture, left), and one original "Birney" car (163, not pictured) which operated in Tampa from 1923-1946 and went through 10,000 man-hours of restoration. Even if youre not using it for transportation, the streetcars are a fun way to see some of the citys historic and cultural sights. Each station is covered and offers benches, ticket vending machines, and information kiosks. Dick Greco Plaza in downtown serves as an intermodal station, offering connections to HART buses, taxis, and easy pedestrian access to the surrounding area.  As of December 2012, a one-way fare is $2.50. A 1-day, unlimited ride pass for streetcars, trollies, and local HART buses are available for $5; as this is the cost of 2 rides (not synonymous with "round-trip"), its highly recommended. Riders over 65, disabled, on Medicare, or 17 and under are discounted to $1.25 per trip or $2.50 for 1-day unlimited, with appropriate ID. A "Family All Day Ticket" is also available, allowing 2 adults plus 3 children or 1 adult and 4 children to ride streetcars only for only $12.50. Children under 4 are free, but if taller than the fare box ID is required. Exact change is required when purchasing on board, streetcar drivers do not provide change.   Additionally, automated Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) are installed at all streetcar stations and accept cash or credit cards and can provide change when paying cash. Three-day and one year passes are available from TVMs and authorized sales outlets. Sales outlets along the line are located at Bank of America buildings concierge (downtown), Grand Central at Kennedy (Channelside), Wine Design (Channelside), Tampa Bay Convention Visitors Bureau Visitor Center (Channelside), Centro Ybor Visitor Information Center (Ybor City), and the HART Administrative Office (1201 E. 7th Ave in Ybor City). Tickets and passes for the streetcar and all HART lines can be purchased  online . For more information about the streetcar line, tickets, or HART services, call +1 813-254-4278.  Service is available M-Th noon-10PM, F-Sa 11AM-2AM, and Su noon-8PM. Streetcars arrive every 20 minutes, except every 30 minutes on Friday/Saturday from 1AM-2AM. Service is extended when the Tampa Bay Lightning play at the Tampa Bay Times Forum, allowing spectators to park in Ybor City and avoid the end-of-game traffic encountered when parking near the forum.</field>

Although Tempe is a small city, the dry and hot summer climate can make it somewhat uncomfortable to self-pedal from one point in the city to another.

		<field name="content">The road system is almost universally excellent, and even the most remote points in the state can be accessed with an average sedan. Gas stations are numerous; however, in rural West Texas, do not press your luck.  Texan highways are often built with parallel frontage roads and turnarounds at most exits. Speed limits are very strictly enforced in rural areas of the state; Texas state troopers will pull you over for an infraction as small as five miles per hour over the speed limit, as traffic fines are often an important source of income for many smaller towns. However, when traveling through larger cities, observing the "common speed" of traffic around you is much safer.  The rural speed limit in Texas is generally 70 MPH, though it increases to 80 MPH on Interstates 10 and 20 in the sparsely populated far western portion of the state.  On the down side, Texas has one of Americas worst traffic safety records and one of the highest number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in America.</field>

Passenger service is no longer an option for cities in the Panhandle or southern Texas. Again, the size of the state is startling; traveling across the width of Texas (from Orange, in the eastern extremity, near Houston, to El Paso in the western extremity) is roughly the same distance as one would encounter while traveling from El Paso to Los Angeles or from Houston to Jacksonville, Florida.   Texarkana , in the northeast corner of the state, is closer to  Chicago  than it is to the extreme southern tip of Texas.</field>

Try to understand that this is Maine and there seasons can be very intense. Try to have a reliable car also; having four wheel drives would be a huge saver. Some of the roads within The Forks and also on the outskirts are often unpaved and can cause damage to certain cars. The following direction I found off of the Crap Apple white water drafting site:  From Points South: I-95 North to Exit 133 in Fairfield, Maine. Follow Rte 201 North 65 miles to The Forks. Pass through Skowhegan and then Bingham (23 miles to The Forks). In The Forks look for our signs and the bridge crossing the Kennebec. Take right turn before bridge and then enter second driveway on right.

		<field name="content">The Forks is a very small town so many of the buildings are within walking distance. What is called the center of The Forks is where the Kennebec and dead river meet. In this area of the forks you have a small store and a few houses along the road. Also, you have a white water rafting company called Crap Apple. All of these places are minutes of each other.</field>

		<field name="content">Suffolk Transits S92 serves the entire North Fork (as well as Easthampton and Sag Harbor on the South Fork).  The bus runs roughly every hour or half hour (depending on the time of day) from Orient but only until 3:35 PM!  There is additional morning service and one additional evening bus from Greenport only.  On the other hand, unlike almost every other Suffolk Transit bus, the S92 has Sunday service in the summers, but the base fare is higher than usual at $2.25.  As is usually the case with Suffolk Transit, dont expect reality to hew closely to the schedules.</field>

The train makes intermediate stops at Mattituck and Southold.  As there are only 2 or 3 trains a day and neither intermediate stop is pedestrian friendly, the train is of limited utility (though it is generally more reliable than Suffolk Transit).</field>

		<field name="content">Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area: I-244, I-44, US 169 (Mingo Valley Expressway, aka "Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway"), US 75, Hwy 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway, The "B.A."), Creek Turnpike.  The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system, with the main arterials running on each mile.  In the core of the city, named avenues run north/south and are named after US cities, generally in repeating alphabetical order (for example, Winston-Yale-Allegheny-Braden).  In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns. North/South is divided by Admiral Blvd.  Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River, vice versa for name streets west of Main.  In the parts of the city farther from downtown, north-south streets are numbered.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is North/South 145th East/West Avenue.  Numbered streets run East/West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line.  Watch out for Place, Street, Avenue designation, e.g. 47th Place, 47th Street, or Florence Place, Florence Avenue.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is West/East 71st Street North/South.  In some parts of the city, numbered streets intersect, so the distinction is important.  Although rare, one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south.  Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks.  When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat, the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass. Thus the "twisted" area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907.</field>

The central station is at 319 S. Denver (downtown). They do not run that often, especially to the outer towns like  Broken Arrow . Unlike major cities in the Northeast, the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city. It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle.</field>

		<field name="content">Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system.  Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs.  The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs.  The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook.  The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus.  Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsas rolling land to be a bit more challenging, particularly during the heat of summer.  If you are looking for a good workout, the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the lands original contours.  Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route.  Four bike loan depots, located along Rivertrail, allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours.   Tulsa has an active bicycling community.</field>

		<field name="content">Serving Downtown Minneapolis, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the airport, the Mall of America, and all points in between. Although automobile transport is most useful for those who wish to explore more than the two downtown areas of the Twin Cities (e.g corporate visitors, or people visiting any of the suburbs), tourists may find light rail the easiest, fastest, and safest transport between the airports, the Mall of America, and downtown Minneapolis. There is currently only one line, though amenities at each stop, and within walking distance of each stop, are expanding. Eastbound and Westbound bus lines also intersect the light rail line at most points, so it is possible that visitors could use public transport exclusively to explore the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. About a mile West of the Mississippi and much of the border between Minneapolis Saint Paul, its possible to use east-west bus routes on the Ford Parkway, Lake Street, Franklin Avenue, or Hennepin Avenue for expedient travel within the cities and to most residential neighborhoods.</field>

		<field name="content">The Twin Cities have an adequate bus system, hobbled by confusing connections to suburban lines, and poor service during non-rush hours (and no service after 1AM except on a few select routes with "night owl" service). The Metro Transit site (linked above) allows you to search for the best routes between your current location and your desired location, and is as good as most such systems in providing good routes and connections.  Bus stops are located very nearly everywhere throughout the city, but some are served only very infrequently, and most are not labeled as to which routes serve them at which times, so take care, especially in sub-zero weather, as to which routes you choose.  Buses on Hennepin Avenue, Washington Avenue, Lake Street, and University Avenue are most consistent and provide transport to the greatest numbers. Express buses operate between the two downtowns regularly during rush hours, and buses to suburbs, or connecting to light rail are limited, and best used during high traffic times.</field>

		<field name="content">Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and some of the inner suburbs are all served by public transit run by   Metro Transit . There are also other transit authorities serving the outlying suburbs. Regular adult fares are currently $2.25 during peak periods (6AM-9AM and 3PM-6:30PM Monday thru Friday) and $1.75 during off-peak periods (these fares come with free transfers lasting 2.5 hours). Ticket machines at light rail stations will also sell 6-hour passes for $4 on weekdays or $3.50 on weekends, and 24-hour passes for $6.  Unlimited ride passes are available in 1-day, 7-day, and 31-day formats. Stored value passes (pay-per-ride) are also available. Day passes are $6 and can be purchased  online , at a Metro Transit Store, from a bus driver, or a ticket machine at any light rail station. 7-day ($22) and 31-day ($59-$113.50) passes must be loaded on a  Go-To card , which can be purchased online, at a Metro Transit Store, or participating Metro Transit sales outlets. Stored value passes can be loaded on a Go-To card in increments of $10 (up to $400), and come with a 10% bonus on each purchase (e.g. a $10 purchase would give you $11 in fare value, $20 would give you $22, and so forth). Once in possession of a Go-To card, reloading it with new unlimited ride passes is easy and can be done online, at Metro Transit stores and outlets, or at light rail ticket machines.</field>

		<field name="name">skyways and tunnels</field>
		<field name="content">Minneapolis and Saint Paul both have extensive second floor ("Première étage") "skyways" that connect central city buildings with each other. Although Minneapolis is larger, the Saint Paul system, to this point, has more connections and is more extensive than Minneapolis system. That said, one could walk from the Convention Center in Minneapolis to Washington Avenue (a block before the Mississippi) without going outside, and without stopping at a pedestrian traffic light. Highway 394 feeds into heated parking garages, so that a Wayzatan suburbanite could enter her Lexus, drive the length of 394 to the heated lot, go to work, shop at Target or Marshall Fields, see a movie, have dinner, and return home - all without having to wear a coat or change clothes, even in 20-below weather.  Even in good weather, mid-day romps in Minneapolis or Saint Paul at street level will miss most of the citizen activity, despite the appearance of crowds and farmers markets, as many folks will choose to get their lattes, sandwiches, takeout, or copy keys, copy documents, or visit their banks, on the second level, a floor above the apparent activity.  As if to confuse you, there is an extensive network of tunnels connecting several buildings on the University of Minnesotas Twin Cities campus. Good idea, only different.</field>

		<field name="content">The Twin Cities, despite unfriendly weather for bikes from about November to April, provides many resources for both recreational and commuting bicyclers. Most major, and primary one-way, and two-way, streets have ample bike lanes which are marked and visible during fair weather months. In addition, all Minneapolis in-city lakes have bike paths that are separated from pedestrian traffic (and from motorized vehicles), and offer one-way transit around the entire Chain of Lakes, extending to Minnehaha Parkway and into Saint Paul. As if that were not adequate, former rail line paths sustain two-way bike lanes following east-west routes just South of Highway 394 and into downtown Minneapolis, known as the Cedar Lake trail; and just North of Lake Street, following a path known as the Midtown Greenway; and both are connected via a spur alongside an active freight railway just East of Cedar Lake and North of Lake Calhoun. It is possible to connect, via either east-west line, to bike trails that connect far into the Western suburbs and beyond, and recreational bicyclers can travel along historic rail lines for uncounted miles West.  Both buses and light-rail trains are equipped with bike racks. It is not uncommon, though still shocking, to see bicyclers in sub-zero weather, and in deep snow. Visitors may find late March to late November as the best period to travel on bicycles, if cold and snow dont arrive or persist.   Nice Ride  is a public bike sharing program that both locals and visitors can rent from.  It currently services both downtowns and limited areas between and outside the central business districts.</field>

		<field name="content">There are several types of airlines flying in the United States today:  Mainline or legacy carriers – Due to bankruptcies and mergers, there are only four major and two minor legacy carriers left: Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, and US Airways, plus Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. These carriers used to be full service, although are increasingly taking after carriers like Ryanair and becoming "no-frills". On a domestic flight in economy class, expect to pay extra for anything beyond a seat, one or two carry-on bags, and soft drinks. Some flights to/from Hawaii or Alaska still offer a few perks, but check for your particular airline and flight.  :Mainline carriers also offer first class for a larger seat, free food and drinks and overall better service. Round trip fares can run over a thousand dollars, even for short flights, making the added cost not worth it for the vast majority of travelers. (Most travelers in first class get their seat as a complimentary frequent flier upgrade or similar perk.) You may also be offered an upgrade at a much lower cost during check in or at the airport if there are open seats available. :A notable exception are certain premium transcontinental services between New York City and Los Angeles/San Francisco offered by American ("Flagship Service") and United ("United p.s."), where First (as well as Business Class) is comparable to equivalent international offerings with gourmet meals and lie-flat seats. Additionally, flights between the East Coast and Hawaii typically feature an international business class like product. Regional airlines come in three varieties: Regional subsidiaries operate under an umbrella such as "American Eagle" or "United Express" and run small regional jets or turboprops to locales where it is not economically or technically feasible to run a full sized jet. These flights are booked through their parent (e.g. Delta Connection through Delta), either by themselves or connecting to a mainline itinerary. On-board service is very basic. There are also Independent regional airlines which are not affiliated with a mainline carrier, these are usually found in more out of the way places, as well as near island communities (Cape Cod, Hawaii, Virgin Islands, etc...) Commuter airlines primarily serve the business travel market, with 10–30 seat turboprop planes. If you can work with their schedules and choice of airports (usually private aviation airports and municipal airfields) – their consistent fares can be a bargain compared even to low cost carriers. Additionally, since fares are the same whether you buy a month in advance or the day of, tickets are also flexible with no cancellation or change fees.  Low-cost carriers  have grown over the past decade. The most famous of these is ubiquitous Southwest Airlines, favorite of leisure and business travelers alike, with Frontier, Spirit, and others becoming formidable competitors. Amenities vary greatly by carrier. On one end, Southwest is the only airline in the United States that lets passengers check two bags free of charge, and have done away with some of the formality of air travel – with no travel agents (all reservations are through their website or call center), assigned seating or buy-on-board programs (free soft drinks and snacks for all passengers.) At the other side of the Spectrum, Spirit Airlines sells seats as low as $9, but charges for everything beyond the seat: checked andhand luggage, advance seat assignments, checking in at the airport, on board refreshments, etc.... Southwest, Frontier and Spirit serve destinations nationwide, although they sometimes use smaller or alternative airports such as Chicago Midway instead of the larger OHare International Airport. Other low-cost carriers such as Allegiant and Sun Country focus on "vacation destinations" (Florida, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, etc...) Hybrid carriers offer more amenities than low cost airlines but with fares lower than the legacies. The most famous of these is JetBlue Airways which has an extensive network covering primarily major airports, one free checked bag, 34 inches between seats (very generous for an American airline) and free satellite TV in every seat. A relative newcomer is the trendy brainchild of Sir Richard Branson: Virgin America which also offers a low-priced (comparatively anyway) First Class option.</field>

		<field name="name">fees</field>
		<field name="content">Quoted prices, both from airlines themselves and from consolidators, generally include all taxes and other mandatory fees, and there is no fuel surcharge. However, extra services tend to incur extra fees. The main ones are listed here, along with strategies for avoiding them. Even baggage fees can be avoided with careful planning:  Checking in with an agent — Some airlines charge $3–10 to check in with an actual human being. Spirit Airlines also charges for using a kiosk at the airport kiosk rather than checking in online. Unless you need to check in with an agent (e.g., if you have specialized equipment that qualifies for a baggage fee waiver), you should check in online and print your own boarding pass. This also saves time at the airport. Some airlines accept emailed boarding passes displayed on smart phones, obviating the need to print them, although many smaller and regional airports do not support mobile boarding passes yet. Checked baggage — Expect to pay $25–35 to check a single bag, an additional $50 for a second bag, and up to $100 or more for a third bag. Particularly large or heavy bags can easily double or triple these fees. Shop around, as some discount carriers give a free baggage allowance; e.g. JetBlue (one bag) and Southwest (two bags). Each passengers cost-free cabin baggage allowance is generally one small suitcase or garment bag and one item such as a briefcase, backpack, or purse. If you can get all your belongings into your cabin baggage, this is the best way to avoid baggage fees. Spirit Airlines charges $20–35 per carry-on bag, making it often cheaper to check in these bags. Dont forget the standard security restrictions regarding cabin baggage: liquids and gels must be in containers under 3.4 ounces (100nbsp;mL) and be presented to security inside a transparent zip-lock bag. Razor blades, electric shavers, scissors, or anything else with a blade or sharp edge can not be carried in cabin baggage.  Pre-paying baggage charges online may give you a slight discount.   Frequent flier rewards programs may give a limited free baggage allowance and additional weight allowances. Some airlines have a branded credit card that offers similar perks.  Shipping luggage via UPS, FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service can work out cheaper than checking in bags. Curbside check in — $2–10 on top of any baggage or check-in fees, plus a tip is usually expected.   Food — Small snacks (e.g., peanuts, potato chips, cookies) are generally free on all flights. On flights longer than 1.5–2 hours, prepackaged sandwiches, snacks, and occasionally hot food at may be available to buy at inflated prices. Flights from the east coast to Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Pacific territories (which can be over 8 hours each way) generally still feature traditional meal service. All airlines allow you to bring your own food and non-alcoholic beverages on board. All except the smallest airports have an array of fast food and quick serve options in the terminal – but you cant bring liquids through the security checkpoint (and some airports do not allow food either). Airside food will inevitably be more expensive than that before security but will be far cheaper and better than whats available on board. Some cities, such as  Philadelphia , regulate airport food vendors and limit how much air-side restaurants can markup. Drinks — Free coffee, tea, water, juice and soda remain standard on all flights. Spirit Airlines, however, is an exception and charges for anything other than water. Alcoholic drinks cost $5–7.  In-flight entertainment — Most U.S. carriers offer entertainment of one kind or another on longer domestic routes. Delta, JetBlue, Virgin America, and some of Uniteds fleet offer free satellite TV in every seat, as well as movies on demand for purchase for $3–8. American has overhead screens showing movies and sitcom episodes on most longer routes, while US Airways and Southwest do not have in flight entertainment of any kind. In-flight WiFi — Delta, JetBlue and Southwest offer in-flight WiFi on nearly all their domestic fleets – US Airways and United offer it on select flights. Prices range from $5–20, depending on the airline, length of flight, and device (tablets and smartphones get a discount as they use less data) but the Internet connection is good for almost the entire flight (at least until told by crew to switch-off your devices). Daily and monthly passes are also available for less than $50/month.  Most airlines do not offer power ports in economy, so be sure youre charged up or have extra batteries for your device.  Mobile phones are usually permitted to be operated in-flight as long as they have been set to flight mode (which effectively shuts-off the mobile phone signal from your provider) before being airborne.   Pillows and blankets are disappearing rapidly. Some airlines dont have them at all; some will charge you for them (but you get to keep after you pay); and one or two offer them for free (but you have to ask for them). Red-eye and long (> 5 hour) flights are more likely to have free pillows and blankets. As always, check with your airline, and bring your own from home if you think youll need them. Lounge passes: Each mainline carrier operates a network of lounges, such as Alaska Airlines "Board Rooms" and Deltas "Sky Clubs" – offering a quieter space to relax or work in, business amenities such as free wi-fi, fax services and conference rooms, as well as complimentary finger foods, soft drinks, beer and wine. Frequent flyers buy annual memberships to these lounges, but any passenger can buy a day pass during check in or at the club itself, usually around $50, although sometimes less if you buy online. Only you can decide if the fee is worthwhile, but if youre in the upper elite tiers of an airline alliance (One World Sapphire or Emerald, Star Alliance Gold or SkyTeam Elite Plus) you may have access to these lounges for free with your frequent flyer card.  For members in the highest tiers, this privilege may be extended to a traveling companion.  Additionally international Business and First Class passengers can also access these lounges for free. First-class upgrades: Delta, United, and US Airways sell upgrades on a first come-first served basis at check-in if first class has open seats. This is one to actually consider, especially if youre checking bags – "day of" upgrades can sometimes be as low as $50 each way, less than the cost of two bag fees. Youd may be paying less to check your bags and additionally getting priority security screening, boarding and baggage handling, along with a larger seat and free refreshments on board.  Most mainline carriers feature "cashless cabins" meaning any on-board purchases must be paid with either Visa or MasterCard (Delta also accepts American Express). Regional subsidiaries generally do still accept cash on board, although flight attendants may not be able to break large bills – hence the traditional request "exact change is appreciated."  If you paid in advance for first class, checked baggage, meals, and alcoholic beverages are all included with the price of your ticket, as well as priority access to check-in agents and boarding.  Ironically, Americas  discount airlines , such as JetBlue, Southwest, and Virgin America sometimes have more amenities than the legacy carriers, and for many people may be a much better experience. JetBlue offers more than 45 channels of satellite television, non-alcoholic beverages and real snacks for free on every flight; Virgin America also has satellite TV, in addition to on demand dining (even in economy). On JetBlue your first checked bag is free ($35 for a second bag), and Southwest is the only U.S. carrier to still offer two checked bags per passenger free of charge. Virgin America charges for checked bags, but their fees are considerably lower than the legacies.</field>

Ensure that any liquids are held in containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces (100nbsp;mL). The containers must all be placed within a single zippered plastic bag that is 1 quart (946nbsp;mL) or less in size. Only one such bag, with however much liquid, is allowed per passenger.</field>

		<field name="name">by private plane</field>
		<field name="content">The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes.  While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first-class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first-class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe.  Air Charter refers to hiring a private plane for a one-time journey.  Jet Cards are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft.  As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not to concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc.</field>

		<field name="name">by plane</field>
		<field name="content">The quickest and often the most convenient way of long-distance intercity travel in the U.S. is by plane. Coast-to-coast travel takes about six hours from east to west, and 5 hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the days necessary for land transportation.  Most large cities in the U.S. are served by one or two airports; many smaller towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there.  Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car.  Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travelers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains.  However most smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices there can be expensive.</field>

		<field name="name">by train</field>
		<field name="content">Except for certain densely populated corridors (mostly just the Northeast), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce and relatively expensive.  The national rail system,  Amtrak  (1-800-USA-RAIL), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often just as expensive as a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travelers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of traveling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant "weekly specials".  Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport.  Amtraks routes traverse some of Americas most beautiful areas.  Travelers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is big, and that "bigness" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas.  For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S., without the trouble and long-term discomfort of a rental (hire) car or the hassle of flying.  Trains running on the Washington D.C. to Boston Northeast Corridor (Acela Express and the Regional) and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Keystone Corridor (Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian) generally run on time or very close to it. These two rail lines are electrified and owned by Amtrak or other commuter railways and are passenger only. Outside these two areas, Amtrak operates on freight lines and as a result must share track with a host railroad; this means you have about as good a chance of a delay as not.  Delays are usually brief (trains make up time en route) but have a contingency plan for being at least three hours late when traveling Amtrak.  Six-hour or longer delays, especially on long-distance routes, are not uncommon.  If you miss an Amtrak connection because your first train is late, Amtrak will book you onto the next available train (or in rare cases a bus) to your final destination. If your destination is on the Northeast Corridor, this isnt a big deal (departures are every hour) but in other parts of the country the next train may not be until tomorrow. If your reservations involved sleeper accommodations (Amtraks First Class on their long-distance overnight trains) on either your late-arriving train or your missed connection, you will get a hotel voucher for the unplanned overnight stay.  For coach class passengers in the same situation, you will not get a hotel voucher; your unplanned lodging arrangements and cost will be your responsibility.  However, after your travel is completed, Amtraks Customer Service will commonly offer travel vouchers of $100 or more off future Amtrak travel to inconvenienced passengers.  This is true for all classes of service.  If you plan to board an Amtrak train at a location other than the trains initial place of departure, its usually a good idea to call ahead before you leave for the station to see if the train is running on time.  A major Amtrak line in regular daily use by Americans themselves is the  Acela Express  line, running between Boston and Washington, D.C. It stops in New York City,  New Haven , Philadelphia and many other cities on the way. This line is electrified, with top speeds of 150 miles per hour (though the average speed is a good deal slower).  The Acela Express has first class service, but can be quite expensive. Given the difficulty and expense of getting from the center of some of the major Northeastern cities to their respective airports, trains can sometimes be more convenient than air travel. There are also frequent but slower regional trains covering the same stations along the Northeast Corridor for lower fares.  During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance, so it pays to book early if you plan on using the long-distance trains. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains since they tend to increase as trains become fuller.  On the other hand, same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees.  One major scenic long-distance train route, the California Zephyr, runs from  Emeryville  in the  Bay Area  of California to Chicago, via  Reno ,  Salt Lake City  and  Denver . The full trip takes around 60 hours, but has incredible views of the Western deserts, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains, things that you just cannot see if you fly. Many of the sights on this route are simply inaccessible to cars. The trains run only once per day, and they usually sell out well in advance.  Amtraks single most popular long-distance train is the Chicago-Seattle/Portland "Empire Builder" train via Milwaukee,  St. Paul/Minneapolis , Fargo, Minot, Glacier National Park, Whitefish, and Spokane.  In FY2007, this train alone carried over 503,000 passengers.  Amtrak also provides reasonably speedy daily round trips between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada and several daily trips between Seattle and  Eugene , Oregon on the Amtrak Cascades line.  Passengers traveling long distances on Amtrak may reserve a seat in coach (Economy class) or pay extra for an upgrade to a private sleeping compartment (there are no shared rooms), which also includes all meals in the dining car.  Amtrak trains in the West feature a lounge car with floor to ceiling windows, which are perfect for sightseeing.  Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable commuter trains that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas.  Since most Americans use a car for suburban travel, some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car for the day to use the commuter train to get to a citys downtown core where it may be more difficult to use a car due to traffic and parking concerns.  Parking rates at the commuter train stations vary due (some facilities may be operated by third parties).  Some commuter train systems and services though do not operate on weekends and holidays so its best to check the systems website to plan ahead. Buy tickets before you board the train as you will either face a substantially more expensive fare or a hefty fine.</field>

		<field name="name">by boat</field>
		<field name="content">America has the largest system of inland waterways of any country in the world.  It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat.  Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises.  Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery.  Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are:    The Erie Canal System  of New York State operates four canal systems consisting of 524 miles of waterway open for recreational and commercial use.  The most famous of these canals is the Erie Canal, which starts around Albany and heads west to Buffalo.  By navigating up the Hudson River from New York City, it is possible to go all the way to the Great Lakes and beyond via these waterways.  Side trips to the Finger Lakes in Western New York or to Lake Champlain and Vermont are possible.  Small watercraft, including canoes and kayaks, are welcome on these canals.     The St. Lawrence Seaway  is now the primary port of entry for large ships into North America.  Recreational boaters are welcome, however, the Seaway is designed for very large craft and a minimum boat length of 6 meters applies.  The Seaway starts in eastern Canada and goes to the Great Lakes.  The Mississippi River There are two channels of navigation from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.  The Mississippi affords north-south access through the interior of the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico and connects with all major interior waterways, including the Missouri River.  Each year, many first time and beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways.  Do remember that any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning.  In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to immediately obey. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route.</field>

		<field name="name">great american road trip</field>
		<field name="content">A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of long-distance car travel; many Americans will tell you that you cant see the "real" America except by car. Given the scarcity of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time traveling between cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around within cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the countrys major natural attractions, such as the  Grand Canyon , are almost impossible to get to without an automobile. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car (see below) is very easy to achieve.  Just keep in mind that because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many long days behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. A "coast-to-coast" trip with multiple drivers and minimal stops will take at least five days (four and a half if you have strong bladders).</field>

		<field name="name">interstate system</field>
		<field name="content">Theres always a road going your way.   The United States is covered with a convenient system of Interstate highways.  Interstates are always expressways (or "freeways")—that is, controlled access divided highways with no grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a "motorway". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city  quickly.  Primary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80).  Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes.  An odd first digit signifies a "spur" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a "loop" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95).  The vast majority of Interstates do not charge tolls, but several eastern states operate cross-state Interstate toll roads called Turnpikes (or the Thruway in New York).  Other states have also started to implement tolls to defray their maintenance costs.  While the majority of these tolls can still be paid in cash (no credit cards or travelers checks), states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling.  Ask your rental car agency or auto club about the tolling options available to you.  Speed limits on the interstate highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70nbsp;km/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85 miles per hour (135nbsp;km/h) in rural stretches of Texas, but mostly theyll be between 65 and 75nbsp;mph (105–120nbsp;km/h). The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly posted on interstates.  American drivers often drive 5 to 10 miles per hour (8–16nbsp;km/h) over the posted speed limit; driving slower than the speed limit can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than 5nbsp;mph (8nbsp;km/h) over the speed limit, and be sure that some other cars are always passing you; avoid being the fastest or the slowest vehicle.  It is customary for the slowest traffic to keep to the right while faster traffic passes on the left.  If you are pulled over by police for speeding, the excuse "Everyone else is speeding too" will not help. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as "Officer," and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed.  You will nearly always get a ticket, but it never hurts to express regret as maybe you will get lucky and only receive a warning.  Many U.S. Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked which white diamonds down the center of the lane, typically have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with multiple occupants (usually two, sometimes three). High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called HOV lanes, are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as Rush Hour. Enforcement of these High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes typically coincide with rush-hour, from 7:00am to 9:00am, and again from 4:00pm to 6:00pm on weekdays. Driving in an HOV lane as the sole occupant of a vehicle during these times is could result in a traffic citation and fine.  Commercial rest areas were prohibited on the U.S. Interstate Highway system by the federal government.  As a result, the vast majority of stopping points are state-operated rest areas with public toilets, parking, tourist information, vending machines, and a small picnic area. While there are no restaurants, gas stations, or other stores, some rest areas are equipped with vending machines. (A notable exception are tolled, limited-access highways such as Floridas Turnpike, where exiting would force you to pay a toll; service plazas with both food and gas are found on these highways every 20–40 miles    or so.) Commercial  traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate exits, even if the exit is miles from the nearest population center.  Sometimes youll find a  truck stop , an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers; Truck stops provide several services all in one building, with a "greasy-spoon"-style restaurant, gas station, general store, and even hot showers.  Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as youre driving.</field>

		<field name="content">A secondary system of federal highways is the U.S. Highway system.  U.S. Highways may be freeways on some sections, but they are often surface roads, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. U.S. Highways, which generally predate the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to U.S. Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you dont mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, U.S. Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights.  Each state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and U.S. Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of State Highways (or State Routes) that form the bulk of the inter-community road network.  State Highways are usually surface roads but may occasionally be freeways; you can generally count on them being well maintained (and plowed in the winter) and that following one will get you to some form of civilization sooner rather than later.</field>

		<field name="content">A 5-light signal (left) indicating that both straight and left-turning traffic has the right of way. If just the green circle was displayed, without a green left arrow, left-turning traffic would have to yield to oncoming traffic.  As with the rest of North America, Americans drive on the right in left-hand drive vehicles and pass on the left.  White lines separate traffic moving in the same direction and yellow lines separate opposing traffic.  Right turn on red after coming to a complete stop is legal except at intersections where a sign prohibits it (like "No Turn on Red"), when there is a red right-turn arrow on a traffic light (in most states), and in New York City. Red lights and stop signs are always enforced at all hours in nearly all U.S. jurisdictions. At all intersections, vehicles must stop behind the thick, white line painted across the road and cannot block crosswalks. There are three ways of indicating how a left turn can be made. Some intersections will have a traffic light with red, yellow, green left arrows; in this case, treat the signal as you would any other. Many intersections have a 5-light traffic signal, with red, yellow, green circles and yellow green left arrows. When a green left arrow is displayed, even if the red circle is simultaneously lit, traffic has the right of way to turn left without the need to yield to oncoming traffic. When just the green circle is lit on a 5-light traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic. A few states use a pulsating yellow, left arrow to indicate that left-turning traffic must yield to oncoming traffic. When an intersection just has the simple red, yellow, green traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic when the light is green. At some intersections, traffic lights arent needed at certain times of the day when there is little traffic (especially at night) and the traffic light becomes either a pulsating red light—which is treated like a stop sign—or a pulsating yellow light which simply indicates caution (there is no need to slow or stop). In some urban areas, signals are found on onramps to freeways have a special traffic signal with only red green lights, which is used during periods of high traffic. At such signals, the light will turn green for a few seconds to allow one vehicle at a time (unless signs instruct otherwise) down the ramp to merge with freeway traffic.  In many U.S. cities curbs are painted to reflect the ability to park at a particular location. The colors used and the meaning of the colors used varies from city to city. In general, red (and sometimes yellow) means "no parking" and blue designates handicapped parking only (with appropriate license plate or placard). In California, yellow curbs designate loading only (goods/cargo), white designates passenger pickup or dropoff, and green indicates there is a time limit for parking (look at signs for time limit). Elsewhere, the meaning of curb colors varies. Always follow parking signs and, if you are uncertain whether parking is allowed at a particular spot, its best to park elsewhere than receive a parking ticket or even have your vehicle towed and impounded (which will result in a large fee to retrieve). A parked vehicle should never block a crosswalk, fire hydrant, or the entrance to a driveway/alley.  Most American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in the sprawling residential suburban neighborhoods where the majority of Americans live.  However, freeways around the central areas of big cities often become crowded with a significant proportion of "hurried" drivers, who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (known as "tailgating"). Enforcement of posted speed limits is somewhat unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Not exceeding the pace of other drivers will usually avoid a troublesome citation. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the reduced speed limits found while going through such towns are strictly enforced.  Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police.  Fortunately, widespread adoption of provisions of the Uniform Vehicle Code, and federal regulation of traffic signs under the Highway Safety Act, means that most driving laws do not vary much from one state to the next.  All states publish an official drivers handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English.  These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices.  AAA publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now  available online  for free.  The Digest contains comprehensive summaries in plain English of all major driving laws that typically vary between states.  The Digests coverage includes all U.S states and all Canadian provinces.  International visitors age 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign drivers license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who will be in the United States for more than a year must obtain a drivers license from the state they are residing in. Written and practical driving tests are required, but they are usually waived for holders of valid Canadian, Mexican, and some European licenses.  Traffic signs often depend on the ability to read English words.  Drivers who can read English will find most signs self-explanatory.  (Progress toward adopting signs with internationally understood symbols is extremely slow; dont count on seeing any.) Distances and speeds will almost always be given in miles and miles per hour (MPH), without these units specified. Some areas near the Canadian and Mexican borders may feature road signs with distances in both miles and kilometers.  Traffic cameras are becoming common in some metropolitan areas and will issue automated traffic citations. Most traffic cameras are positioned at intersections and the most commonly issued citations are not coming to a complete stop when turning right on a red light, not stopping behind the stop line (thick, white line across the road before the crosswalk), and driving through a red light. As of  July 2013 , 519 communities across 25 states D.C. use cameras at intersections for red light infractions and 129 jurisdictions across 13 states D.C. use cameras to catch speeding.  Police patrol cars vary in make, model, color, and livery from state to state and even town to town, but all are equipped with red and blue flashing lights and a siren.  If you see the lights or hear the siren, pull to the right-hand shoulder of the road to let them by.  If the patrol car is directly behind you, its your car the officer is targeting; in that case, pull over as soon as it is practical for you to do so safely, even if this means driving some extra distance. It is extremely important that you pull off the road as soon as you are able. The officer will request to see your drivers license, the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance coverage, and/or rental car documentation. Most traffic stops are recorded by a video camera in the troopers patrol car, as well as a lapel mike on their person.  See the section on  police officers  in the Stay Safe section below.</field>

		<field name="content">Virtually every car from every rental agency in the U.S. runs on unleaded gasoline and has an automatic transmission. Renting a car usually costs anywhere from $20 and $100 per day for a basic sedan, depending on the type of car and location, with some discounts for week-long rentals. The major rental agencies are  Enterprise Rent-A-Car  (+1 800 RENT-A-CAR);  Hertz  (+1 800 230 4898);  Avis  (+1 800 230 4898);  Thrifty Car Rental ; and  Dollar Rent A Car . There are no large national discount car rental agencies but in each city there is usually at least one. A couple discount car rental companies, usually restricted to areas of the country, are  Advantage Rent A Car ,  E-Z Rent-A-Car  (+1 800 277 5171) and  Fox Rent A Car .  The internet or the Yellow Pages are the easiest ways to find them. One widespread chain is  Rent-A-Wreck  (+1 800 944 7501). It rents used cars at significantly lower prices. Most rental agencies have downtown offices in major cities as well as offices at major airports. Not all companies allow picking up a car in one city and dropping it off in another (the ones that do almost always charge extra for the privilege); check with the rental agency when making your reservations.  Renting a car at an airport location can sometimes cost 3 times as much as renting the same car (from the same company) at a downtown location, but in other areas, the airport location will be cheaper. On-line travel websites such as Orbitz or Expedia can be useful to compare the best prices and make reservations.  Rental agencies accept a valid drivers license from your country, which must be presented with an International Drivers Permit if your license needs to be translated.  You may wish to join some kind of auto club before starting a large American road trip, and having a cell phone is a very good idea. Most rental agencies have some kind of emergency road service program, but they can have spotty coverage for remote regions. The largest club in the United States is  AAA  (+1-800-391-4AAA), known as "Triple A". A yearly membership runs about $60. AAA members also get discounts at many hotels, motels, restaurants and attractions; which may make it worth getting a membership even if you dont drive. Alternatively,  Better World Club  (+1-866-238-1137) offers similar rates and benefits as AAA with often timelier service and is a more eco-friendly choice (1% of revenue is donated to environmental cleanup programs). Some non-U.S. automobile clubs have affiliate relationships with AAA that allow their members to use AAA services. These include the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), The Automobile Association in the UK, and ADAC in Germany.  Most Americans renting cars are covered for loss or damage to the rental car either by their credit card or their own private vehicle insurance policy. Without appropriate loss/damage waiver cover, you could be liable for the entire cost of the car should it be written off in an accident. Purchasing loss/damage waiver cover and supplemental liability insurance may add up to $30/day to the price of a rental, in some cases doubling the price of the rental. If you visit the car rental website and identify your country of origin, you may be given a quote which includes the loss/damage waiver and liability insurance for considerably less.  Many  travel insurance  policies include cover for some rental car damage – check your policy against the rental terms and conditions.</field>

		<field name="name">fuel</field>
		<field name="content">Gasoline ("gas") is sold by the gallon, at stations that are primarily self-service (you must pump your own gas) with the exception of those in New Jersey and Oregon (where self-service is illegal). The American gallon is smaller than the UK gallon, and equals 3.785 liters.  The U.S. octane scale is different from that used in Europe; a regular gallon of U.S. gasoline is rated at 87 octane, the equivalent of about 92 in Europe.  In most states, gas stations offer a choice of three levels of octane: 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade or plus), and 91 (premium).  Unless you are renting a luxury vehicle, your vehicle will likely require only 87 regular.  If you are driving in the Rocky Mountains area, you may encounter stations that offer gas at lower octane ratings, most commonly 85 octane.  This is suitable for use by 87-octane vehicles at high elevations, but if youre heading for lower elevations, be sure to fill up with 87 octane.  Diesel is not as common, but still widely used and available at most stations, especially those catering to truckers.  Untaxed "offroad diesel", sold in rural areas for agricultural use, is dyed red and should not be used in cars, as there are heavy fines if youre caught.  Despite increasing petroleum prices worldwide and some increases in gas taxes, the American consumer-voters attachment to his automobile, combined with abundant domestic oil reserves and relatively low taxes on gasoline, has kept retail fuel prices much lower than in many parts of the world. Prices fluctuate by region and season. As of January 2013, current prices are averaging near $3.30/gallon (equivalent to $0.87/liter) for regular and $3.90/gallon for diesel ($1.03/liter).  Gas prices vary dramatically from state to state based on a number of variables, primarily state sales tax rates (which are invariably included in the advertised price). The highest prices are usually found in Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, Illinois, and New York. The lowest are generally found in the south central U.S. A good rule of thumb to find cheaper gas is to venture away from the highway and city centers. There are numerous mobile apps written that will display the cheapest fuel prices within a set range.</field>

		<field name="content">The "High Five" five-Level interchange in  Dallas  Americas love affair with the automobile is legendary, and most Americans use a car traveling within their city, and when traveling to nearby cities in their state or region.  Generally speaking, American cities were built for the automobile, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is very limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. (The exceptions are New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., where having your own car is not only unnecessary, but discouraged.) In most medium-sized American cities, everything is very spread out and public transportation thin. Taxis are often available, but if youre not at the airport, you may have to phone for one and wait a half-hour or so to be picked up, making similar arrangements to return. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, dont be surprised if many arent familiar with the local public transport options available.  Gas stations usually sell regional and national maps.  Online maps with directions are available on several websites including MapQuest and Google Maps. Drivers can obtain directions by calling 1-800-Free411, which will provide them via text message.  GPS navigation systems can be purchased for around $100, and car rental agencies often rent GPS units for a small additional fee.  Many smartphones are now bundled with GPS navigation software that offers turn-by-turn directions. Even states that ban the use of hand-held phones by drivers often allow the use of GPS features, as long as the driver enters no data when in motion (check local laws in the places you will be traveling).  Unlike the rest of the world, the United States continues to use the imperial system, meaning that road signs are in miles and miles per hour, and fuel is sold in gallons. If driving a car from Canada or Mexico, make sure you know the conversions from metric to imperial units (1 mile is about 1.6 km).</field>

		<field name="content">Intercity bus travel in the United States is widespread, and while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent (e.g. as of July 2012 there are 82 daily buses, by seven operators, on an off-peak weekday each way between Boston-New York, an average of nearly one every 10 minutes during daytime hours). Many patrons use bus travel when other modes arent readily available, as buses often connect many smaller towns with regional cities.  The disadvantaged and elderly may use these bus lines, as automobile travel proves arduous or unaffordable for some.  Its commonly considered a "lower class" way to travel, but is generally dependable, safe, affordable.   Greyhound Bus Lines  (+1 800-229-9424) and several affiliated partners have the predominant share of American bus travel. Steep discounts are available to travelers who purchase their tickets 7–14 days in advance of their travel date. Greyhound buses typically runs in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if its the middle of the night.  Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on.  There are no reservations on Greyhound buses.  All seating is on a first come, first served basis, with the exception of select cities, where you can pay a $5 fee for priority seating.  Internet-based buses are becoming very widespread.  Megabus  offers inexpensive daily bus service across the country in several disconnected regions: The East Coast (also includes destinations as far west as Cleveland and Pittsburgh as well as Toronto and Montreal in Canada) hubs in New York City and Washington D.C. Midwest hub in Chicago. South hubs in Dallas and New Orleans. California (also includes Las Vegas and Reno in Nevada) hub in Los Angeles.   BoltBus  competes with Megabus on major routes in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest. With the exception of Boston (where all long distance buses are required by law to use the main South Station bus terminal) discount buses usually depart from either outside train stations or at curbside locations to keep costs down. The lowest fares are available by purchasing online several weeks before you travel but Bolt and Megabus both offer cash fares to walk-up passengers on a space available basis.  So called Chinatown buses also provide curb-side departures for a standard walk-up cash fare often much lower than other operators fares. These lines operate through the East Coast down with some further out destinations in the Midwest and South, along as along the West Coast.  GoToBus.com  is the largest online booking agent for these buses.  Hispanic bus companies tend to have the most spacious buses in the country. Connections from Texas hubs to the Midwest including Chicago, the Southeast and Mexico are offered Mexican(-American) companies  Tornado Bus ,  El Expreso ,  El Conejo ,  Omnibus Mexicanos  and  Groupo Senda . Service in and out of Florida is offered by the Chilean  JetSet , Argentinian  RedCoach , and Cuban-American  La Cubana . In California and the Southwest operators include  FuturaNet  and  Crucero , which have tickets starting from $1.  There are numerous other local operators, many of which are also affiliated with Greyhound or Amtrak. The next largest affiliation is  Trailways .  The Federal Highway Administration certifies all bus operators, though they have a hard time keeping wraps on the large amount of services. Curbside bus operators (Chinatown and Internet based buses) are more dangerous than others, though still much safer than driving a private vehicle.</field>

		<field name="content">Recreational vehicles ndash; large, sometimes bus-sized vehicles that include sleeping and living quarters ndash; are a distinctly American way to cruise the country.  Some RVers love the convenience of being able to drive their home anywhere they like and enjoy the camaraderie that RV campgrounds offer.  Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing.  And dont even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York.  Still, if you want to drive extensively within the United States and are comfortable handling a big rig, renting an RV is an option you should consider.</field>

		<field name="content">The thrill and exhilaration of cross country travel are magnified when you go by motorcycle. Harley-Davidson is the preeminent American motorcycle brand and Harley operates a  motorcycle rental program  for those licensed and capable of handling a full weight motorcycle. In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as "lane-sharing" or "lane-splitting," is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use "high-occupancy vehicle" or "carpool" lanes during their hours of operation.  American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. Motorcycle clubs are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. Riding clubs may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding.  Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in  Sturgis , South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country.</field>

		<field name="content">Gateway Arch, St. Louis ,  Missouri  in the  Midwest  ]]  A long history of  hitchhiking  comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. Today, hitchhiking is nowhere near as common, but there are some nevertheless who still attempt short or cross-country trips.  The laws related to hitchhiking in the U.S. are most covered by the Uniform Vehicle Code (UVC), adopted with changes in wording by individual states. In general, it is legal to hitchhike throughout the majority of the country, if not standing within the boundaries of a highway (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road) and if not on an Interstate highway prohibiting pedestrians.  In many states Interstate highways do not allow foot traffic, so hitchhikers must use the entrance ramps. In a few states it is allowed or tolerated (unless on a toll road). Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon are a few states that do allow pedestrians on the highway shoulder, although not in some metropolitan areas. Oklahoma allows foot traffic on all free interstates, but not toll roads and Texas only bans it on toll roads (and on free Interstates within the city of El Paso). Oregon only bans it in the Portland metro area. Missouri only bans it within  Kansas City  and  St. Louis  city limits.  Hitchhiking has become much less popular due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media). International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable "thumbing a ride" if they had a good knowledge of the locale.   Craigslist  has a rideshare section that sometimes proves useful for arranging rides in advance. If you are open with your destination its almost always possible to find a ride on C.L. going somewhere within the U.S.</field>

		<field name="content">A Cassins Finch clings to a feeder at the Vail Nature Center in Ford Park.  If you are coming from somewhere else and skiing, you can park on site.  It will cost about $25 (2010) per day.  Best advice arrive early (before 9am) on busy days and you wont have problems.  There are two parking garages, one in Vail and one in Lionshead.  The Lionshead garage is the shortest walk to the slopes.  If the garages do fill up, you may to park on the road.  The problem being that they dont let you park on the road until BOTH garages are filled.  So say you drop your friends off at Golden Peak (so they can put their kids in child care) then go back to the Vail parking lot, its full, so you then have to go park in Lionshead and take a bus back to catch your friends.  For those doing child care there is also a ($25/day) valet parking at Golden Peak, cheaper to park at the main Vail garage and walk (5 mins).  Most Hotels in Vail, (see: upscale) will provide you with a free shuttle, just ask before you arrive.  Most major car-rental firms are located in Denver and Vail airports.  There a many free buses going throughout the Vail valley.  For current schedules see:    .</field>

		<field name="content">Similar to San Francisco, most of Vallejo uses a grid-like network of roads with about every three blocks north/south being a major road that crosses town.  Its best to also ask for a cross street when looking for directions. Most roads in this area are named by US states going east/west and California counties going north/south. On Mare Island, the grid is based on numbered and lettered streets. There are also numbered streets on the mainland, but they are in broken order and have other named roads in between them. Other roads (mostly in the east) are usually rural roads or roads that are located in the hills, and cant hold to the grid.</field>

		<field name="name">by foot</field>
		<field name="content">In some places, walking is the most convenient way to travel from one area to another. Epcot, Disneys Hollywood Studios, and the five resorts in between (Swan Dolphin, Yacht Beach Clubs, and Boardwalk) are connected by walkways, as is Downtown Disney to Disneys Saratoga Springs Resort. If you are staying at Disneys Contemporary Resort, you will find it quicker to walk to the Magic Kingdom than to take the ferry or monorail. From Shades of Green (a military-only resort) its a five-minute walk to Disneys Polynesian Resort, to take the monorail or ferry to the Magic Kingdom; and from the Polynesian Resort its another five-minute walk to the Transportation and Ticket Center, to take the monorail to Epcot.  Keep in mind, though, that youll be doing a lot of walking within the parks, especially at Epcot and Animal Kingdom, so dont tire yourself out early!  Strollers, wheelchairs, and electric convenience vehicles (ECVs) are readily available to rent at the entrance to each park.  If you have a problem standing too long, or if walking on the hot pavement makes your feet ache, renting a wheelchair or ECV can make a big difference.  Wheelchairs can be brought up to the loading area of most rides, where youll usually need to transfer to the ride vehicle.  Both wheelchairs and ECVs are accommodated in most theater and stage attractions.  Strollers will usually need to be left outside; most attractions have a designated stroller parking area.  Electric standing vehicles (ESVs) are also available for guests who have trouble walking, but also cannot sit for long periods of time.  There are very few ESVs, though, so it might be a bit of a hassle to rent one.  A Single stroller rents for $15, or $13/day for multi-day rentals.  Double strollers are $31, or $27/day.  Wheelchairs are $12, or $10/day.  ECVs and ESVs are $50, with a $20 refundable deposit.  Even if you park-hop, you only have to pay once per day; simply show a same-day receipt to avoid paying a second fee.</field>

		<field name="name">by bus</field>
		<field name="content">Disney buses   Learn to love the ubiquitous Walt Disney World bus system.  Youll be using it a lot, especially if you didnt bring a car.  The bus routes are set up to facilitate travel from a resort to a park, but not from one resort to another or from one park to another.  Most resorts have five bus routes originating from them, providing direct service to all four theme parks and Downtown Disney. Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach are served by the Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom routes respectively.  Disneys Boardwalk is actually part of a resort, so visitors from other resorts (except Swan/Dolphin or Yacht/Beach Clubs) will have to travel there via one of the parks.  The most convenient option is Disneys Hollywood Studios, which has two connections to the Boardwalk: walking or ferry. (Although Epcot is the closest park to the Boardwalk, using it as an interchange is not recommended, as it would require entering through the main entrance and exiting out the back entrance, thereby costing the admission fee.)  Note that there is no bus service to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot from the Magic Kingdom-area resorts; they are served by the monorail system.  Likewise, service to Epcot and Disneys Hollywood Studios from the Epcot-area resorts is by ferry or walking.  There is also no direct bus service between the theme parks and Downtown Disney.  To travel to Downtown Disney from a theme park, or vice versa, you must travel to any resort and change buses. The most convenient resort for this purpose is Disneys Saratoga Springs Resort, which is right next door to Downtown Disney; you can get there via a pedestrian bridge, bus, or ferry.  The buses are reliable, fairly efficient, and reasonably comfortable, but they can be slow and inconvenient if, for example, you are traveling with young children or strollers. You may wait up to twenty minutes for a bus to your destination, and another ten to thirty minutes to get theremdash;possibly longer during the busy season. Also keep in mind that guests in wheelchairs and ECVs have first priority when boarding.</field>

		<field name="name">by monorail</field>
		<field name="content">Monorail Coral   Walt Disney Worlds monorail system is one of its signature attractions, and its not even inside one of the parks.  They do a great job of getting large numbers of guests from place to place, but theyre also quite comfortable and fun to ride.  The monorail service is limited and only goes to certain areas, all originating from the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC). There are three monorail lines:  Express: This route travels from the Transportation and Ticket Center (adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot) to the Magic Kingdom gates and back, without stopping at the resorts.  This is primarily used by Magic Kingdom guests who parked in the lot or are coming from Epcot.  This route runs on the outer rail, counter-clockwise around Seven Seas Lagoon. Resort: This route runs parallel to the Express route, clockwise on the inner rail, and stops at all the resorts it passes. The stops are, in order: Transportation and Ticket Center, Polynesian, Grand Floridian, Magic Kingdom, and Contemporary.  This route is used by resort guests to get to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot, and by guests visiting one of the resorts. Epcot: This route travels between the Transportation and Ticket Center and the Epcot gates.  When entering Epcot this way, the monorail makes a nice loop in the park before arriving at the station, giving a great aerial view of Future World and the World Showcase.  If you are going to Epcot from the Polynesian Resort, you may walk to the Transportation and Ticket Center to get to the Epcot monorail; its usually faster than taking the Resort monorail completely through the loop. The same is true of traveling to the Magic Kingdom from the Contemporary Resort.  It is also possible to walk to the TTC from Disneys Wilderness Lodge, which is not connected to the monorail. The distance is about half a mile, and takes around 10 minutes.</field>

From the Magic Kingdom, large ferries transport guests to the Transportation and Ticket Center, adjacent to the parking lot. Smaller ferries travel to the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Fort Wilderness Campground, and Wilderness Lodge (and sometimes the Contemporary). From Epcot and Disneys Hollywood Studios, service is to the Swan/Dolphin, Yacht/Beach Club, and Boardwalk.  From Downtown Disney, service is to Saratoga Springs, Old Key West, and the two Port Orleans resorts.</field>

		<field name="content">There are three Hess gas stations within the resort: at the Car Care Center on World Drive, on Buena Vista Drive near the entrance to Hollywood Studios, and on Buena Vista Drive across from Downtown Disney. The Hess stations on Disney property do charge market rate for their fuel, unlike a few Orlando gas stations where the cost of fuel is still outrageous despite the recent drop in gas prices. Gas stations along State Road 535 (Apopka-Vineland Road) near the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza are notorious for pricing well above the market rate for fuel.  However, for sheer chutzpah, you gotta hand it to Suncoast Energys, located on State Road 436 (Semoran Boulevard), just outside the Orlando International Airport. Its location across the street from the Hertz and Thrifty rental-car lots makes it a tempting top-off-the-tank stop, but be sure you take note of the pump price, which is usually $1.50-$2 higher than the local average.  Visit  Orlando Gas Prices  to find the local average price and get addresses for other handy gas stations.</field>

Parking is free, though, for guests staying at any of the on-site Disney Resorts (your Key to the World card serves as your parking ticket), or who have a valid Annual Pass. The four theme park lots are huge, and are divided into subsections; this is to enable you to remember your cars location. To save you from having to walk the long distances, there are trams that will shuttle you from the parking lot to the park gates and back (except in the case of the Magic Kingdom, where the tram will take you to the Transportation and Ticket Center, from which you may take the ferry or the monorail to the park).   Parking at the two water parks or Downtown Disney is free. However, there are no parking lot trams available, so be prepared to walk.  Valet parking is available at Deluxe resorts (see the  Sleep  section) for $15/day (keep your receipt; its good all day).</field>

		<field name="content">If you are staying on-site, a car is not necessary, unless you wish to travel off-property during your stay.  Some people purchase groceries to use during their stay; while there are a couple of places on the property to buy them, better selection and prices are found off property. Other people use a car to avoid the delays that can sometimes affect the public transportation options.  If you are staying at a hotel off Disney property, on the other hand, a car is strongly recommended. Many off-resort hotels offer shuttle service to the parks, but the schedules may not be convenient.  Getting around Walt Disney World by car is not much of a problem. All you need to do is follow the purple directional signs with black Mickey Mouse ears to your destination. Your WDW resort will also provide a map of the complex.  If you run into problems, just drop by the Walt Disney World Car Care Center on World Drive, near the Magic Kingdom toll plaza.  The five golf courses (see  below ) are accessible only by car; however, complimentary taxi service is available for guests of Disney-owned hotels.</field>

The main freeways are I-5, running along the west side of Washington through many of Western Washingtons population centers. I-90, running east of   Seattle  to  Ellensburg  and  Spokane , and I-82, which starts at I-90 near  Ellensburg  and heads southeast through  Yakima  and  Kennewick . Other US highways and WA state routes access all parts of the state. Rental-car agencies can be found in the larger cities.  All of the states major east-west highways cross over the  Cascade Mountains , which are subject to closure, delays, and studded tire or chain requirements in wintertime. In severe weather, it may be better to use I-84 just across the border in Oregon. This route goes through the relatively low elevation of the Columbia River Basin. On rare occasion, I-84 may also have weather-related problems where it passes north of  Mount Hood . A 20-mile detour on Washington State Hwy 14 is available between I-84 Exit 44 Bridge of the Gods, and Exit 64 Hood River Bridge. Both have a small toll.</field>

Inland, the state also offers some free ferries across the Columbia River. There are also some county-run ferries to smaller destinations such as to Anderson Island and Guemes Island.  Many ferry destinations are not islands without a bridge, but peninsulas where going by land would involve a very long detour. The most extreme example of this is the  Port Townsend  --  Keystone  route on State Hwy 20. Only five and a half miles via the ferry, becomes a whopping 217 miles (354 km) traveling by car!</field>

		<field name="content">Public transportation is limited in the Wausau Area.  Metro Ride (formerly WATS or Wausau Area Transit System) operates eight bus routes in the City of Wausau which run at 30-minute intervals; one bus route in the Village of Weston, which runs at 30-minute intervals; and one bus route to Rothschild and Schofield, which operates at 60-minute intervals. Passengers can transfer between routes at the Metro Ride Transit Center, which is located at 555 Jefferson Street in the downtown Wausau, one block from the Wausau Center Mall. Passengers can also transfer between Route C and Route K at Shopko in Rothschild and between Route E and Route I at Aspirus Clinic in Wausau.  Buses are clean and uncrowded but the limited schedule makes them somewhat impractical to all but the most dedicated transit user.</field>

Ample, free, at-door parking is available everywhere outside of the downtown area.  Downtown, parking is easy to find and very inexpensive.  As the city and surrounding area are oriented north/south, for trips from the far north to far south side or visa versa, it is quicker and easier to use the US 51/I 39 expressway which runs along the west edge of the city.</field>

		<field name="content">The best way to see the state is definitely by driving, as West Virginia is generally lacking in reliable statewide public transportation. Many towns are basically inaccessible except by car, as is some of the best scenery. But be careful — off the main highways, the roads often loop around the mountaintops, which makes for some stunning views but also requires careful driving. Hairpin curves around mountain roads are not to be taken at high speeds, and the smaller country roads dont always have guard rails. Many such turns are also at steep inclines - make sure you engine brake and obey all speed limit signs. Do not follow too closely to coal trucks, lest your windshield be cracked by falling hunks of coal.</field>

		<field name="content">Car is by far the most efficient way to get around Wheeling.  Traffic in Wheeling is non-existent, outside of congestion related to road construction or vehicle accidents, so driving through Wheeling can be accomplished with a great deal of ease.  Interstate 70 runs east to west through the city, and provides primary access to all of the areas major roadways.  I-70 enters the city by crossing a back channel of the Ohio River at  Wheeling Island (Exit 0), providing access to U.S. Route 40, and the Wheeling Island Racetrack Casino.  I-70 then crosses the main channel of the Ohio River, entering downtown Wheeling, and then continues east through Wheeling Tunnel.  U.S. Route 40 (Old National Road) is the main commercial thoroughfare in Wheeling, traveling east to west through the city, and has several interchanges with I-70.  State road 2 is Wheelings primary north to south road, running roughly parallel to the Ohio River the entire length of the city.  Route 2 is a limited-access freeway south of downtown, and becomes a two-lane surface street north of downtown.  Interstate 470 is a spur to I-70 that begins in the Elm Grove section of the city (Exit 5A), and spurs south, crossing the Ohio River in the South Wheeling section of the city, and merging with I-70 outside of St. Clairsville, Ohio (Exit 219).</field>

Car rental is available at the airport from these companies: Avis, +1 910 763-1993 Hertz Rent-a-Car, +1 910 762-1010 National Car Rental, +1 910 762-8000 Thrifty Rent-a-Car, +1 910 343-1411  Traffic can be heavy in some parts of Wilmington (South College Rd., Market St.), but on the whole, driving around town is relatively easy. For the most part, major thoroughfares radiate out from the historic downtown, and there are numerous streets that allow you to cut across these radiating thoroughfares. The new Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway provides easy access to downtown, the airport, Interstate 40, and the beach while bypassing the most congested parts of Wilmington.</field>

		<field name="content">Wisconsin has two international airports, Mitchell International in Milwaukee (MKE), which is a hub for Midwest Airlines/Frontier Airlines, and Austin Straubel International in Green Bay (GRB).  Regional airports with scheduled service exist in Madison (MSN), Appleton (ATW), Wausau/Stevens Point (CWA), Rhinelander (RHI), La Crosse (LSE), and Eau Claire (EAU).  Service to the far western "Indianhead" region of the state can be found across the Minnesota border in Minneapolis (MSP) and Duluth (DLH).  Travel by air within Wisconsin has become rather impractical in the last 25 years.  Unless traveling to/from Milwaukee, travel between Wisconsin cities by air requires a connection in Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis or even Detroit.  It is usually faster and less expensive to travel within the state via automobile.</field>

		<field name="title">Wyoming</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">Wyoming is served by three interstate highways. Interstate 80 runs from east to west along the path of the transcontinental railroad; I-25 runs roughly north-south from the Colorado border south of Cheyenne to just north of Buffalo; and I-90 extends from the South Dakota border west to Sheridan and then north to the border with Montana. These roadways are designed to get you where youre going as quickly as possible, but they do not follow the most scenic routes in the state. Interstate 80, especially, follows a rather bleak path for much of the distance across the state. If you have more time and the weather is good, its well worth the effort to get off the Interstates and see some of the beautiful scenery along the states secondary highways.   Visiting the states national parks by car will mean driving on one or more of the federal and state highways, mostly two-lane roadways that can become clogged with traffic during peak visitor season. These roads follow more interesting terrain, but are slower than the interstates. The highways that run through the Bighorns from Sheridan or Buffalo to Cody are a much more interesting than taking I-90 to Billings or Bozeman (both near entrances to  Yellowstone ), but they require a bit of preparation and effort. These highways are more subject to weather conditions because they cross mountain passes and because they are secondary highways. If youre unsure of weather conditions, be sure to phone ahead and inquire, even in summer months. Snowstorms can occur in higher elevations through June.   Keep in mind that the distances between towns and cities can be vast and that in some parts of the state, you may travel great distances without seeing another soul. Be prepared: keep you gas tank full and carry water and some basic provisions, especially in winter. If youre unsure of weather or road conditions, consult Wyomings Department of Transportation by dialing 511 (within the state) or 1-888-996-7623 (1-888-WYO-ROAD) from anywhere in the US. Youll need a map or some knowledge of highway numbers and locations to use this service.</field>

		<field name="name">by plane</field>
		<field name="content">Air travel between points within Wyoming will likely require a change of plane in Salt Lake City or Denver. Fares are prohibitively expensive for leisure travelers - a two-week advanced purchase airfare from Casper to Jackson Hole cost more just over $1,000.00 as of May 2012, involved an eight hour trip and a change of planes in Salt Lake City. The same trip takes no more than five hours by car in good weather. In practical terms, driving is the only real way to get around the state, with air travel an alternative only when weather wont allow travel by car.</field>

Roads can become very crowded whenever people stop to view wildlife; use pullouts, and be respectful of other motorists to help avoid bear-jams.  When snow falls roads may be closed, and during winter months many park roads close permanently.</field>

The park reserves a number of campsites for cyclists, but during the busy summer season it is probably best to reserve sites in advance wherever possible.</field>

		<field name="content">Winter is perhaps the most tranquil time to visit the park when there are the fewest number of visitors.  The winter use season of snowmobile and snowcoach travel begins in mid-December and ends in mid-March. Actual opening or closing dates for oversnow travel varies by entrance and will be determined by adequate snowpack and plowing schedules.  Visitors wishing to visit the park on a snowmobile or in a snowcoach must either travel by commercial snowcoach or accompany a commercial guide on snowmobiles (private, unguided snowmobiles or snowcoaches are not allowed) which are available at most entrances. Best Available Technology snowmobiles are required, and there is a daily limit on snowmobile and snowcoach entries. Off-road use of snowmobiles and snowcoaches is prohibited.</field>

		<field name="name">by car</field>
		<field name="content">In general a car is a great way to tour the park, although during the summer Yosemite Valley can be so crowded that a shuttle bus is a vastly better option.  Be aware that the Tioga Pass Road and the road to Glacier Point are seasonal and close as soon as the first major snow falls.  Other park roads may close during storms, but in general are always open.  Note that the speed limit in all areas of the park is fairly slow, and is strictly enforced by rangers with radar guns; the speed limits are for your own safety on the twisting mountain roads, as well as for the safety of pedestrians and the many animals that use the area.  The loop road through Yosemite Valley is now one-way.  For many years this was a two-lane road, but motorists travelling slowly to admire the scenery often created a long backup of annoyed drivers, so the Park Service converted most of the roads in the valley into one-way roads to allow passing.  As a result, when driving in the valley be aware that a wrong turn can send you on a one-way five-mile detour.  The one-way routing affects those entering from Oakdale on Hwy 120 the most. You will have to cross over to Southside Drive at the Pohono Bridge. Likewise upon leaving the park, those taking the south exit on Hwy 41 to Fresno also cross the Pohono Bridge, backtrack one mile, before turning right onto Wawona Road.</field>

Shuttles operate from 7AM until 10PM in the eastern portion of Yosemite Valley year-round, stopping at or near all accommodations, shopping areas, and major sights.  Wawona-Mariposa Grove.  Between spring and fall a free shuttle operates between Wawona and the Mariposa Sequoia Grove.  Parking is often full at the grove, so the shuttle then becomes the only option for visiting.  Badger Pass Bus.  During the ski season a free bus travels twice daily between Yosemite Valley and the ski area.  Tuolumne Meadows Shuttle Bus.  During the summer season this bus provides access to points in and around Tuolumne Meadows.  Tuolumne Meadows Hikers Bus (fee charged).  This bus travels in summer between Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows, dropping hikers off along the way.  To guarantee seating tickets should be purchased one day in advance by calling (209) 372-1240.  Glacier Point Hikers Bus (fee charged).  This bus provides service between Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point, making stops along the way.  To guarantee seating tickets should be purchased one day in advance by calling (209) 372-1240.</field>

Large vehicles, (710" in width or 114" in height), (RVs, buses, trailers, 5th wheels, and some camper shells) that wish to travel the length of the park, require an escort to be stationed at both ends of the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. Large vehicles have trouble staying in their lane while traveling through the tunnel. Escort costs are $15 per vehicle, valid for two trips through the tunnel during a seven day period. Very large vehicles, including those taller than 131", may be prohibited from entering the tunnel.  During the winter Zion roads are plowed and sanded, except the Kolob Terrace road, which is closed. Be prepared for winter driving conditions, including potentially icy roads, from November through March.</field>

		<field name="name">by shuttle</field>
		<field name="content">From mid-March through the end of October, Zion uses a shuttle system to eliminate congestion in the canyon. The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is closed to all private vehicles during this time (except those with a red pass that are staying at the Zion Lodge). Shuttles are fully accessible, with extra room for bikes, backpacks, and climbing gear.  Zion operates two different shuttle routes. One goes through the town of Springdale (see the Get around section on  Springdale ), and terminates at the Park entrance, within walking distance of the visitor center.  The other route goes through Zion Canyon and has 9 stops: the Visitor Center, the Zion Human History Museum, Canyon Junction, Court of the Patriarchs, Zion Lodge, Grotto, Weeping Rock, Big Bend, and the Temple of Sinawava.  Frequency of the Zion Canyon route depends on the time of day. In Spring and Fall the shuttle runs from 6:45AM-10PM every day, with 7-15 minute frequency. In the Summer (mid-May to early September) the shuttle runs from 5:45AM-11PM every day, with 6-15 minute frequency, and 30 minute frequency in the very early morning and late evening.</field>

		<field name="content">The beautiful scenery of the park makes a hike practically a mandatory event. Some of the best hikes in the National Park System are in Zion, including Angels Landing and the Zion Narrows. The park offers trails of varying difficulty and length, suitable for twenty minute strolls or multi-day backpacking trips.</field>

		<field name="name">by bike</field>
		<field name="content">Zion is one of the most bike friendly parks in the National Park System. Bicycles are an excellent option for traveling the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. Shuttle buses are equipped with bike racks for those wishing to ride only part of the way. Bicycles are permitted only on established roads and the Pa’rus Trail which goes from the Watchman Campground to Canyon Junction. If youre riding from the south entrance into Zion Canyon, take the Parus Trail since its safer than the main road.  Cyclists must obey traffic laws. Bicycles are not allowed on hiking trails (except the Parus Trail) or off-trail. Ride defensively; automobile traffic can be heavy and drivers may be distracted by the scenery. Park shuttles will not pass bicycles, so use turnouts to allow them to pass. Riding through the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel is prohibited; bicycles must be transported through the tunnel by motor vehicle. Usually the ranger (escort) at the tunnel will ask those driving a truck if bikers can hop in the back of their trucks. If you arent bringing your own bike there are a few rental agencies in  Springdale .</field>

Some companies will provide bus travel from nearby towns while others begin in Zion National Park. Some will provide just a brief tour with small stops, while others may take you on a hike, and arrange all your meals.</field>

		<field name="name">walking</field>
		<field name="content">One of the best ways to absorb the unique culture of Union City is to simply walk around.   Bergenline Avenue is a bustling main thoroughfare, where restaurants and stores run continuously for dozens of blocks. Many of the shops and restaurants are independently owned. Because Bergenline is a one-way southbound street, it is very congested to drive through during most hours of the day. Starting on the north end of  Washington Park , the first several blocks are mostly residential. After walking from the park a few blocks, businesses begin to emerge. Buildings on Bergenline span three centuries; many still standing from the 19th Century.  The entire northern section of Bergenline, from 32nd to 47th Street, is particularly interesting to walk, as many buildings from the 19th century and early 20th century are still standing; as a result, this district is listed on the New Jersey Historic Preservation.</field>

		<field name="content">Rock Island is generally an easy city to navigate.  The city streets are basically laid out in a grid pattern with the avenues traveling east to west and streets north to south.  Very few streets are named and instead are numbered.  The numbers for the avenues begin at the Mississippi River and progress in order as one travels south.  The street numbering system begins at Moline in the east and progresses in order as one travels west.  It is important to note that the Mississippi River generally travels through the Quad Cities from east to west before heading in its normal southerly direction. Thus, Davenport, Iowa is to the north of Rock Island and not to its west.     The Quad Cities has a  wayfinding  color code system for signs that direct people to various venues and attractions in the area.  The area is divided into quadrants with their own colors and identifying headers on direction signs have the appropriate color for each quadrant so that you will know, by color, which quadrant you are in and to which color you will have to travel to reach other attractions.  Rock Island is in the southwest quadrant and its attractions are on signs that use the red color in the header.  The southeast quadrant (Moline-East Moline) is blue, the northeast quadrant (Bettendorf) is yellow, and the northwest quadrant (Davenport) is green</field>

There is also railroad tracks that separate the downtown businesses from a large surface parking lot along the Mississippi River. Even though there are not a large number of daily freight trains on the tracks, caution should be exercised.</field>

		<field name="content">The main terminal consists of one large, rectangular structure which has been divided (by signage, not physically) roughly into 1/3rds across the shorter side into two "terminals"—Terminal A Terminal B—separated by a central concourse with shops, a food court, and two atriums on the ends where security checkpoints and connections to the airside trams are located. A hotel is located in the East Atrium. Ticketing, shops, security, and airside trams are all found on Level 3 of the main terminal building. The ticketing/check-in counters along each terminal have been assigned zones to make it easier to locate the check-in for your airline. Level 2 is the Baggage Claim level. Level 1 is the Ground Transportation level, where rental car offices are located inside and public buses, airport shuttles, and taxis are accessed outside.  There are large parking garages flanking the north and south sides of the terminal building, signed as "A Garage" and "B Garage" corresponding to the neighboring terminal. These parking structures consist of: Levels R1 R2 — The lowest two levels are for rental vehicle storage, pick-up, and drop-off. Levels 1-3 — Mixed short long-term parking. Covered, except some spaces on level 3. Level 4 — Mixed short long-term parking on top of parking structures (exposed to weather). Crossover bridge atop terminal building between "A Garage" "B Garage" and access to "Terminal Top" parking. To access the main terminal from the "A Garage" or "B Garage", take the elevator to the lowest level, the Pedestrian Tunnel, walk through the tunnel (or ride the moving sidewalk), then take the long escalators to Levels 2 or 3 or use the elevators to access all levels of the main terminal building.  While most people search for parking spaces on the lower levels of the A or B Garage, continue up to Level 4 to access the Terminal Top parking garage (Levels 4-10), which permits both short long-term parking. The benefit of driving up to these levels is that the Terminal Top parking structure is located directly above the main terminal building and the elevators in this parking structure travel directly down to ticketing baggage claim areas of the main terminal building.</field>

		<field name="content">As is typical in California Central Valley cities, a car is useful and often necessary to access most parts of town. There is a modest bus system, Fresno Area Express (FAX), but a car would be advised. Traffic congestion in Fresno is not as bad as larger places in California, but Shaw and Herndon avenues can get quite crowded, especially since there is no east-west freeway through the north side. CA-99 runs along the west side of the city, becoming semi-rural before exiting Fresno County on the northwest side of Fresno. CA-41 runs down the middle of the city. Until the late 1990s and early 2000s these were the only freeways in Fresno, but a surge in growth has spurred the development of the CA-180 and CA-168 freeways.  In 2011, Fresno became the first town or city in the Central Valley to earn a Bronze Medal Designation from the League of American Bicyclists, recognizing Fresno as a bicycle friendly community.  The city is in the process of further expanding its bike lanes in an effort to improve bike access.  For a current map of Fresnos bike lanes, follow this link.</field>

Another one to know is US HWY 63 as it is how you are going to enter and leave Jonesboro.  Southwest Drive, Caraway Road, and Stadium Blvd are all accessible from 63; the other three intersect the three accessible from 63.</field>

		<field name="content">The best tip for navigating the Outer Banks is to learn their main roads and milepost system.  There are two main drags on the beaches.  State Highway 12 is known as Virginia Dare Trail, or more commonly "the Beach Road".  US 158 is known as Croatan Highway, but the locals refer to it as "the Bypass" or "the Big Road".  Most advertisements you find will refer to them that way.    The Mileposts are similar to what you find on the interstates.  Green signs on the right hand side of the road, marked every half mile.  Milepost "0" is at the Wright Memorial Bridge on the north end in Kitty Hawk.  Head south on the Bypass or Beach Road and the Mileposts get higher with Milepost (MP) 16 at Whalebone Junction being the end of the main drag.</field>

		<field name="title">Albuquerque</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Albuquerque is a heavily planned city.  In much of the city, the major roads are lined primarily with businesses with residential mazes on the insides. The city is divided into four quadrants, with street addresses taking the form "12345 Main St. (NE/NW/SE/SW)" in which the NE/NW/SE/SW suffix denotes the quadrant of the city containing the address. The railroad tracks, which run parallel to I-25, are the east–west dividing line, and Central Ave. is the north–south dividing line. Thus, the street address 3600 Menaul NE would be north of Central and east of the railroad tracks. This nomenclature, while useful in helping you with maps and directions, has the drawback that you cant tell whether a street runs north–south or east–west simply by looking at the address.  By and large its difficult to get truly lost in Albuquerque, thanks in large part to the looming presence of the Sandia Mountains to the east. If you can also remember that I-25 runs north–south, I-40 runs east–west, and the Rio Grande runs along the bottom of the valley in the western part of the city, you should be able to make your way around the city without too many problems. Here are some basic terms that will come in handy when asking for directions or looking at a map:  Central Avenue is a principal east–west artery, running roughly parallel to I-40 and through Downtown just west of I-25 and past the University of New Mexico (UNM for short) just east of I-25. The Heights are the eastern part of town closest to the Sandia Mountains. You may also hear reference to the Foothills, which are the most extreme eastern part of the city, right at the base of the mountains. Uptown is a business and shopping district located in the Heights at I-40 and Louisiana Blvd. The North Valley and Los Ranchos de Albuquerque (technically a separate community from Albuquerque) encompass the area north of I-40 between I-25 and the river. The South Valley is the area south of Central Avenue west of I-25. The Westside is all the suburban neighborhoods on the western side of the river. Rio Rancho, a separate community from Albuquerque, is the metro areas largest suburb and can be considered a northern extension of the Westside.</field>

There is some parking available throughout the city, but RIPTAs   public transport network is extensive and an alternative to driving.  Although public transit in Providence is almost entirely comprised of buses, the buses are on-time, reliable, and much of RIPTAs bus fleet is new. Kennedy Plaza, RIPTAs downtown bus station, has recently undergone a major overhaul and is well laid out with digital displays at each terminal that tell when the next bus will be coming.  Two of the downtown lines are run completely on natural gas trackless trolleys (called the Providence LINK Trolley), and cover most of historic Providence.  Base fare is $2.00, though e-riptiks or ride passes may be purchased either on-board or at local Shaws and Stop and Shop supermarkets.Seniors or disabled persons ride for half price during non-peak hours with the presentation of an id. Students from some local colleges can buy discounted bus passes or use their school id cards (policy varies depending on the school).</field>

Idaho Falls is small and the majority of the hotels are located centrally enough that a small walk will get you to most destinations. The distance to some locations would warrant a taxi service.  There is fair competition in the taxi business and service is very good for a town this size. You can generally get a ride anywhere in town and even Ammon, which borders Idaho Falls, for under $15 (Idaho Falls city limits, $10). It is more economical to rent a car if you have several destinations over the duration of a day. If you have less than 5-6 stops, taxis are excellent. SafeRide and Easy Way Taxi offer 24/7 service.  There is currently no mass transit.</field>

		<field name="content">Walking along the AC Boardwalk   The most popular way to get around Atlantic City is on the 4-mile long Boardwalk (the oldest in the United States), as eight of the eleven casinos are on the Boardwalk.  While ones feet are the most popular way of navigating the boards, there are also old-fashioned rolling chairs that can be hired. These shaded surreys are rolled up and down the length of the Boardwalk by experienced guides, who are out soliciting riders day and night. The fee is based on the distance traveled, but expect a minimum fare of $5 plus tip.  Bikes can be rented as well, with the Boardwalk being the favorite spot to ride. Note that bikes are only allowed on the Boardwalk from 6:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the summer months, so be sure to get up early. Bikes of all sorts can be rented (single, tandem). One bike rental location is B K Bike Rental at N Carolina Ave and the Boardwalk.   Taxicabs are plentiful throughout the city. The easiest way to get a cab is to call a local service, go to a taxi queue outside of any casino, or visit drop-off points at the Atlantic City Convention Center. The maximum cost for a taxi ride within city limits for up to five passengers is $13, not including tip.  One can also travel between the casinos along Pacific Avenue, which runs parallel to the Boardwalk 1 block inland, aboard the Atlantic City Jitney, tel. 609/344-8642;   , a fleet of minibuses that run 24 hours a day; the fare is $2.25 The baby-blue and upcoming green versions also run to the Marina section of the city, where the Trump Marina, Borgata, Water Club and Harrahs casinos are located.  Handicap mobility scooter and wheelchair rentals are available through Diamond Scooters, tel. 609/646-0003;   . They will deliver a scooter or wheelchair to your hotel of choice. Make a reservation several days in advance to have your equipment waiting for you when you arrive.</field>

However, during the summer months it is quite popular for residents to travel by bicycle or by foot.  In fact, in the exclusive community of Harbor Point, there are no cars allowed during the summer months.</field>

Stateline casino resorts in South Lake Tahoe have free shuttle buses to most of the ski resorts.  Most of the shuttle buses do not check if you are staying at the resort.  Hitchhiking is also common in the north shore, although usually for shorter regional distances.  The majority of rides are given by local residents.</field>

They stop at the transportation center (the Amtrak station), the visitors center, and various spots throughout the town. They mostly are meant to serve the community, but the Yellow line goes to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA.  Most people get around by car. Recently, construction projects to widen Richmond road has created constant traffic jams.   The intersection of Richmond Road, Boundary Street, Jamestown Road, and Duke of Gloucester Street (non-vehicular, but with many pedestrians) near Colonial Williamsburg and the historic district is the most notorious (and confusing) feature of Williamsburg driving.  Dubbed by locals as Confusion Corner, right-of-way confusion can result in accidents or close calls.  For tourists in this area, Traffic heading west on Jamestown Road and east on Richmond Road toward Boundary Street and have right of way; all other traffic must stop or yield.  This intersection is at the corner of the College of William and Marys campus, so be alert for pedestrians in this area.  Free parking in the restored area is difficult to find, and is generally limited to two hours.  Colonial Williamsburg offers hourly and daily parking in numerous short-term lots near the restored district.  Parking at other shopping areas is generally free, though it can get crowded at peak seasons.  The Commonwealth of Virginia and Department of Motor Vehicles has certified local bus company Oleta Coach Lines, Inc for a bus route from The Williamsburg Transportation Center to shopping malls around The Hampton Roads area.  The Williamsburg bus route    runs from Williamsburg to Hampton, to Newport News then back to Williamsburg.  It runs twice on Tuesdays.</field>

The city is laid out in a grid pattern; a handful of diagonal streets exist.  Major through streets are generally located once per mile; there are generally 14 streets to the mile.  Traffic can be heavy on major streets and in downtown during rush hour and on football Saturdays.  By Bus StarTran    service runs on weekdays and Saturdays (but only until 6:30PM).  Individual fares are $1.75 (have exact change)/seniors $0.85/trips in the downtown zone or on the Star Shuttle are $0.25.  Monthly passes are $45; various discounts are available.  Passes can be purchased at many businesses around town (primarily grocery stores and banks).  By bicycle Lincolns trail system extends throughout the city.  A cyclist can travel across the city in an hour or less.  Bike rentals at Monkeywrench Cycles, downtown (1225 P St,   ) For a map of bike trails visit   .</field>

		<field name="content">St. George, like all cities in Utah, follows a well-defined grid system that makes it easy to get around and find your destination. For an example, lets take the address 650 South 300 East. Each hundred represents one block radiating out from a center point of the town. In St. George, the center of the grid system is the intersection of Main Street (a north-south avenue) and Tabernacle Street (an east-west street). To find 650 South 300 East, starting from the intersection of Main and Tabernacle, you would drive 3 blocks to the east, then just over 6 blocks south. Keep in mind that in St. George, St. George Boulevard, a major east-west arterial, takes the place of 100 North.  While the grid system in the heart of town is well-defined, it can be become difficult to follow in the outlying areas and new subdivisions on the outskirts of the city. While in some cases the addresses will still follow the grid pattern, the blocks will become smaller and more irregularly spaced, and there will be more streets that dont follow the grid system at all.   Suntran  is St Georges public transit system, with three different routes serving the city. St. George also has a good  trail network  offering some very scenic routes for pedestrians, bicyclists, and skaters.</field>

		<field name="content">It is possible to visit New England without an automobile.  Doing so requires the visitor to study schedules very carefully, purchase tickets in advance when possible, limit visits to one or two destinations, and keep in mind that local public transportation operates infrequently, if at all, at night, on weekends, and during the middle of the day.  The visitor may also sign up for a group tour by bus or cruise ship.  Bus tours and cruise ships visit all the major tourist destinations, if only to drive by with expert commentary by tour guides. Group tours do have the advantage of eliminating all worries about destinations, lodging, and meals, although they have inflexible schedules, offer virtually no opportunity to meet local people, and perhaps too much acquaintance with ones fellow passengers.</field>

		<field name="content">Highway travel is by far the cheapest way to get around the South.  Fast-paced interstate highways cover most of the region, and connect all major cities.  Of course, there is also the option to fly from city to city; but in most cases this is considerably more expensive than driving.  Similarly, there is a limited amount of rail transit available, but this is usually quite expensive and much slower than an airplane.   Do not expect to rely too heavily on public transit in most Southern cities.  With only a few exceptions, cities in this region favor auto traffic.  As a result, traveling beyond the core of a city is often difficult without an automobile. In all cases, it is best to do your homework before arriving.</field>

Interstate 40 is the main east-west corridor that links up the main cities of the Triangle, passing through Raleigh, the Research Triangle Park, and past RDU airport and Chapel Hill. The Durham Freeway (NC 147) links the Research Triangle Park and I-40 to Durham, while US-15/501 connects Durham to Chapel Hill. There are also two loop freeways circling Raleigh and serving many of the suburbs: I-440 circles the central portion of Raleigh proper, while I-540 traverses much of the suburban fringe north of Raleigh before heading south to the Research Triangle Park. South of the RTP, I-540 becomes a state-run toll freeway for the stretch around Cary south to Apex.  Each of the main cities operates a local bus service. Regional service is provided by  Triangle Transit , which operates all-day service Monday-Saturday (no Sunday service) between Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, operating out of a hub in the Research Triangle Park. Fares cost $2 per trip, with $4 for a day pass.</field>

		<field name="content">Once in downtown Walnut Creek, walking is basically your only choice. This shouldnt pose a problem because most of the downtown area is somewhat concentrated (10-15 minute walk at most). The biggest problem is parking.  Driving. Most will use a car to get around Walnut Creek. Be careful of pedestrians; they tend to jump off corners when you least expect it.   Parking. Hidden among the storefronts are countless garages. The garages run by the City charge actual money; whereas the garages of the many malls are free but claim to be valid for only three hours. The garages closest to Broadway Plaza are the most congested. You can usually find ample parking in the Plaza Escuela garage (on either side of Locust at Botelho), only one block from downtown and Broadway Plaza.   Hint. Try parking on the street - the street meters cost the same as the garages. If you do park on the street, make sure you put enough money in the meter because Walnut Creek metermaids continually circle the town looking to increase the city coffers at your expense. The best hint for using the street meters is to arrive early, you may have to circle and you wont find a spot right in front of any place youre interested in visiting.  Public Transportation. If youre down on your luck and cant afford a car, the County Connection bus line is your ticket to reach Walnut Creek. If all you want to do is see downtown and shop, a free shuttle operates between the BART station and several downtown stops. Using a bicycle is a snap in this bike friendly town, or if youre wealthy you can recharge your Segway at the free electric recharging stalls at the BART station. For the rest, using your feet never hurt (other than your feet).  Taxis.</field>

		<field name="content">Most numbered state and US highways in and near the mountains are on good paved road, although a few on the east side are gravel.  Few passes cross the range that support highways.  Palo Flechado Pass and Bobcat Pass are near Taos, Glorieta Pass skirts the southern end of the range near Santa Fe, and an unnamed pass connects Mora and Peñasco near the middle of the range.  All of these can be closed for periods during the winter following snowstorms.  Snow tires and either chains (have them available but dont use them routinely) or 4 wheel drive are a good idea when driving in the mountains between Thanksgiving and mid-March, and on occasion can be needed earlier or later.  4 wheel drive is definitely desirable year-round on some of the minor forest roads, particularly on the west side.  There are a number of roadless areas in the mountains that are accessible to hikers, mountain bikers, etc.  In addition to the wilderness areas that are parts of the national forests, Taos Pueblo occupies considerable territory between the town of Taos and the ridge line.  In contrast to most roadless areas in the range, the Taos Pueblo lands are closed to visitors without a permit from the tribe (which can be difficult to get).  There are other private in-holdings at the northern end of the range that may also be closed; check locally.  Most areas that are suitable for hiking in the summer are also suitable for cross-country skiing in the winter, but be careful: the ridges are steep enough to pose serious avalanche hazard.</field>

With many highways available to Dunmore, it is easy to get out and get around.  Private taxicabs such as Posten and McCarthy service the area as well. They are hired by telephone through central dispatch and cannot be hailed on the street as in larger cities.   Walking is also a safe and easy way to get around Dunmore.  Being a very small town, it is also very safe so people should not feel threatened walking to get around.  County of Lackawanna Transit System (COLTS) also operates public buses throughout all parts of the city and a few Lackawanna County extremities. The system typically operates from 7AM-7PM and does not operate on Sundays or Holidays.</field>

		<field name="content">The downtown area is compact and rather easy to get around on foot.  Most of the streets are arranged in a grid, but the grid is not strictly aligned with north (more like north-northwest).  Street address numbers increase (by 100 every 2 or 3 blocks) radiating from Santa Clara Street (an east/west street) or First Street (a north/south street).  Furthermore, Santa Clara Street (and other east/west streets) carry the prefix East or West radiating from First Street; and First Street (and other north/south streets) carry the prefix North or South radiating from Santa Clara Street.  This makes it somewhat easy to locate a downtown facility given its street address.  Outside downtown, things are spread out in San José, so a car is the most convenient mode of transportation. However, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority,  VTA , does offer serviceable transit around town. The frequency and hours of buses vary depending on the route and your location, so its best to check a schedule beforehand. The Light Rail system (primarily the Mountain View-Winchester route and the Alum Rock-Santa Teresa route) provides quick service to, from and around downtown;  a single fare, $2 for 2010, is good for 2 hours.    Its a trolley, its a train... its Light Rail!   A VTA day pass lets you use buses and Light Rail lines all day and costs $6 for an adult, and $5 for a youth as of 2010.  VTA Route 10  serves as a free shuttle between the SJC airport, Caltrain Santa Clara Station, and Light Rail - Metro/Airport Station.  DASH (Downtown Area SHuttle),  VTA Route 201 , another free service connects downtown San Jose and the Light Rail with the San Jose Diridon Transit Center.  The  511.org website  is a wonderful resource for trip planning, whether by car or public transit (or a combination of both). Its Trip Planner spans all Bay Area transit systems. On the go, you can call VTA Customer Service at +1 408 321-2300 and listen to bus schedules on their automated system.  Many roads in San Jose have designated bike lanes and/or wide shoulders. A map of the citys bikeways is available on  VTAs website . This, along with typically favorable local weather, makes biking a viable means of transportation within the city. Bus lines, Light Rail and Caltrain all accommodate bikes, making mixed-mode travel a simple affair.</field>

Depending on which hotel you stay at, they may offer transportation services. If you are not staying at a hotel and need to get around, you can use a taxi service. The Island is very strict with drunk driving, so when you go out at night, make sure you have a ride back to where ever you are staying. Remember, it is better to be safe than sorry.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of Pensacola   Map of Downtown Pensacola  Driving is by far the best way to get around the Pensacola area. With the exception of downtown, parking is plentiful and free. Downtown has street parking and a few parking garages, most of which have small fees during the work day, from 9AM to 5PM, Monday through Friday. Downtown parking is free on the weekends, but may be scarce during special events.  Travel through the city may be confusing for the first time driver; some of the major streets have multiple names, the most notorious of which is FL SR 296, which also goes by Bayou Boulevard, Brent Lane, Beverly Parkway, Michigan Avenue, and Saufley Field Road!  In addition, many major thoroughfares curve, or run at odd diagonals. A map will come in handy.  I-110 is a major interstate running north-south through Pensacola, and provides a very handy guidepost for travel through the city.  There are bicycle lanes throughout town along most major roads, but theyre not easily noticed unless they are actually being used; look for small lanes on the side of the road with a bicycle symbol painted on the asphalt. Downtown Pensacola is great to see from a bike, especially the old Seville area and the historic district.</field>

If a festival is happening, especially KaboomTown, expect to sit in traffic much longer.  Be watchful for traffic cops as they are strict and tend to hide themselves well. Arapaho Road, Belt Line Road, Midway Road and Quorum Road are well patrolled.  By Bus: Most placed in Addison are accessible by DART bus   .  On Foot/Bicycle: Most streets in Addison have sidewalks, and the city is working to make the city more accessible on foot or by bike.  There are bicycle racks on the front of all DART buses serving Addison.  The Les Lacs Linear Park    is available in the southern part of Addison for a quiet and pleasant 2.7-mile paved trail.</field>

		<field name="content">The Bahai Temple in Wilmette, one of the "7 Wonders of Illinois"  Car travel is best for the majority of the state, easily accessed by interstates. Numerous highways closer to Chicago are tollways, but the rest of the highways are free.  EZ-Pass users from the eastern U.S. can use their transponders on the Illinois Tollway at all toll booths.  The price for EZ-Pass and I-Pass Users is half the cash price listed on the sign at the toll booth.  Below are the major routes:   I-94: A major east-west route servicing the Chicagoland area, I-94 enters the state concurrent with I-80 just west of  Hammond .  It separates from I-80 near South Holland and heads due north, servicing portions of southern  Cook County . It meets I-57 near Chicago State University where the former terminates and continues northward, joining I-90 in the southernmost portion of Chicago.  The combined I-94/I-90 route passes immediately to the west of the Chicago Loop.  The route continues northwest from there and splits in the Mayfair neighborhood.  I-94 then continues due north where it passes to the west of many prominent North Shore communities before moving westward and meet I-294, which terminates.  I-94 then heads into Lake County passing by more North Shore communities before entering Wisconsin.    I-90: Another major east-west route, I-90 enters the state near the East Side neighborhood.  It runs concurrent the Chicago Skyway as a tolled road before meeting I-94.  It splits from I-94 near the Mayfair neighborhood and continues on a northwest path, servicing  OHare International Airport ,  Schaumburg  and  Elgin .  It passes through a rural stretch before connecting  Belvidere  and  Rockford .  It heads north from there and enters Wisconsin.  I-88: A major east-west route, I-88 originates near the intersection of I-294 and I-290 in the immediate western suburbs of Chicago.  From there, it travels west-southwest connecting  Naperville ,  Aurora ,  DeKalb ,  Rochelle  and the  Quad Cities .  I-80: Another major east-west route, I-80 enters the state concurrent with I-94.  It continues due west after the split connecting  Joliet ,  Morris  and the Quad Cities prior to crossing into Iowa.  I-55: A major north-south route, I-55 originates at Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and moves southwest past Midway International.  It continues its southwest track and connects many southwestern suburbs such as Joliet.  After leaving  Chicagoland , it continues southwest and services  Bloomington-Normal ,  Lincoln ,  Springfield  and the communities in  Metro-East .  It joins and runs concurrent with I-70 and exits upon entering  St. Louis .  I-57: Another major north-south route, I-57 originates at its intersection with I-94 in southern Chicago.  It moves south from Chicago and connects  Champaign-Urbana , Mattoon,  Effingham ,  Mount Vernon  and  Marion .  It meets I-24 at its terminus and then proceeds south before heading into Missouri.   I-70: One of the major east-west routes in Central Illinois, I-70 enters west of  Terre Haute .  It travels southwest connecting Effingham and Metro East.  It joins I-57 briefly before exiting in  St. Louis .  I-72: An east-west route, I-72 originates in Champaign near I-74..  It moves westward connecting Champaign, Urbana,  Decatur  and Springfield before entering Missouri at  Quincy .  I-74: An east-west route, I-74 enters the state east of  Danville  and heads northwest connecting Champaign, Urbana, Bloomington, Normal and  Peoria  before terminating in the Quad Cities.  I-294: An east-west route, I-294 is one of the highways bypassing Chicago.  It originates near  Hazel Crest  and heads northwest west through the southwestern, western and northwestern suburbs and past OHare International Airport before terminating at its meeting with I-94 on the Lake and Cook County border.  I-290: Another east-west route, I-290 serves as the route connecting the Chicago loop with the western suburbs.  For much of its course, it runs concurrent with other routes and terminates at I-90 in Schaumburg.  I-355: Another Chicago bypass route, I-355 runs on a north-south course originating at its intersection at I-290 near  Bloomingdale .  It moves south servicing the western and southwestern suburbs before terminating at its intersection with I-80.  I-255: The major Metro-East bypass route, I-255 originates at its intersection with I-270 and heads south-southwest and terminates at its second meeting with I-270.    Train travel is another way to get around Illinois. Metra train lines serves Chicago and the surrounding suburbs and Amtrak serves significant portions of the rest of the state. While Metra trains usually run on time, Amtrak trains are more prone to running late. Check with Amtrak before making the trip.   Greyhound buses, Megabus discount buses and its sister bus company, Coach USA, serves many Illinois locales. Chicago and the nearby suburbs are served by the PACE bus system and many large Illinois cities have bus systems of their own.</field>

		<field name="content">The Bronx has good subway coverage but all lines are mainly north to south, with the subway lines designed more for access to Manhattan than crosstown travel in the Bronx, and many of its bus lines are slow and overcrowded at times. Many people who need flexibility in getting across the Bronx drive; however, the notorious overcrowding on the Cross-Bronx Expressway sometimes reduces such crosstown travel to a standstill. Another option is Metro-North Railroad. It only serves limited sections of the Bronx, but those tend to be the areas without subway service. (There is the Hudson Line in the West Bronx, and the Harlem Line in the central section of the Bronx). The fares are higher than the subway, and the trains dont run as frequently, but they offer less crowding. (Plus, on the weekends, a "CityTicket", which allows a trip within the city boundaries, costs only $4.00. In general, with sufficient planning and time, you can enjoy the borough through a combination of subway and bus travel and walking. A bus map can be found  here .</field>

		<field name="content">Most people get around Iowa by car. Certain, more rural parts of Iowa - like much of the Midwest - are laid out on a grid pattern. Drive on any of the states outer highways, and you will quickly come to realize that there is an intersection at every mile. This makes figuring out where you are and getting from there to where you need to be a relatively simple undertaking.  Travellers unaccustomed to ice and snow may have trouble driving in Iowa winters - plan ahead if you need to travel during the colder parts of the year.  Major Routes in the State include the following:  Interstate 80: The States major east-west interstate, it services major cities including  Davenport ,  Bettendorf ,  Iowa City ,  Des Moines  and  Council Bluffs .  Most other major cities including  Cedar Rapids  and  Ames  are within a half hour drive of I-80.  Interstate 35: The States major north-south interstate, it services  Ames  and  Des Moines  as well as regional cities such as  Mason City  and  Indianola .  Interstate 380: A branch of Interstate 80, the route connects  Iowa City  to  Waterloo  via  Cedar Rapids .  The route terminates at US 20.  Interstate 29: Connecting  Kansas City  to  Omaha  and  Sioux Falls , the route mostly traces the  Iowa / Nebraska  border and connects  Council Bluffs  to  Sioux City .  US 30: Americas first transcontinental highway, US 30 runs through the center of Iowa connecting  Clinton ,  Cedar Rapids ,  Marshalltown ,  Ames ,  Denison  and  Missouri Valley .  US 20: Another major transcontinental highway, US 20 enters Iowa at  Dubuque  and services  Waterloo ,  Fort Dodge  and  Sioux City .  US 151: Originating in the  Amana Colonies , this route heads northeast connecting  Cedar Rapids  and  Dubuque .</field>

Unless you are mainly visiting the downtown and/or the University campus (which are within walking distance of each other), you will find that getting around by car is the most convenient method.  Downtown, Main Street divides cross-streets North and South, and Limestone marks East versus West.  Addresses downtown usually specify a cardinal direction, which provides a clue to what area of the city its in.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of the county   As noted above, youll probably want a car to get around the county.  If you need to rent one, theres an Enterprise    branch in Albion, but youre probably better off renting at the airport or train station where you came in.  Orleans Transit Service, a subsidiary of the Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority   , does offer weekday bus transportation around and between the villages of Medina and Albion ($1 within a village; $2 between; halved for seniors and children 6-12; kids under 6 free with adult), but if youre going any farther afield, or interested in traveling at night or on weekends, youll need a car.  Fortunately for drivers, the county is criss-crossed by an array of well-maintained state routes.  Routes 18, 104, 31, and 31A travel eastndash;west, while routes 63, 98, and 237 are the main northndash;south routes.  104 is the primary highway, with only a few speed zones to slow you down, while 18 is a scenic lakeside route.  31 parallels the canal through Medina, Albion, and Holley, while 31A bypasses those villages to the south.  Off the state routes, roads are usually paved, but theyre often narrow and sometimes completely devoid of markingsmdash;even on what are nominally "major" connecting roads.  Nonetheless, traffic is light enough that you shouldnt have any problems.  Deer will probably pose a greater hazard to you than other motorists.  The major creeks of the county are not well-suited for boat navigation, though the stretch of Oak Orchard River immediately upstream of the dammdash;an area known locally as Lake Alicemdash;is fairly placid.  The canal, on the other hand, is eminently navigable, with only a few lift bridges and no locks to delay your voyage.</field>

Bikers be warned: there isnt much room for bicyclers who want to ride on the road, the terrain is hilly, and drivers generally arent very considerate of bicyclers on major roads such as Main Street.</field>

Road travel in Wyoming requires more planning than in more densely populated parts of the country. Inquire locally about driving conditions and travel times, which vary as much by weather and terrain as by road condition. In some parts of the state, four-wheel drive vehicles may be advisable or even required for travel. Car rental agencies are located in  Casper ,   Rock Springs ,  Cody ,  Jackson ,  Cheyenne ,  Sheridan  and  Laramie .  State information centers run by Wyoming Travel and Tourism can offer directions, restrooms and other services. Find them in Cheyenne, Sheridan, Beulah (northeast Wyoming) and Laramie.</field>

Metcalf Ave will take you just about anywhere, although at parts, it has many lanes and is a bit confusing. Before driving on this street, make sure you know where youre going and dont drive on it during rush hour (5PM-7PM), or expect to be sitting there at least an hour.  State Line is the street directly between Kansas and Missouri, thus the name.  One strange road name is College Blvd, but is mainly due to Johnson County Community College in western Overland Park. College Blvd is 111th Street, despite the confusing name. Also, 135th St turns into Santa Fe as youre heading West. If you happen to be on Santa Fe, that means youre no longer in Overland Park, you are in Olathe. Overland Park lies between I-35 (north) and 199th St (south) and State Line (east) and Quivira (west).</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around Estes Park has become easier in recent years.  The town itself is small and can be covered reasonably well by walking.  Most tourist visitors have their own car.  You can park in one of the city lots (free) and walk a couple of blocks to get downtown.  Estes Park has implemented a free shuttle bus system    that begins at the Visitor Center and has stops in  Rocky Mountain National Park  as well as a variety of stops within town.  There is some provision for bicycles.  Paved trails radiate out from Lake Estes toward the south and west.  But the part of the trail that goes downtown is restricted to walking only.  Cycling on the main roads is OK, but shoulders can be sparse.  Be careful of "tourist drivers" who will perform strange unpredictable maneuvers.  There is a local taxi-cab company   , but do not depend on this as your only transportation option to get around the town as it is inconsistent at best.    Transport within the National Park is mostly by private vehicle but shuttle bus service between the Moraine Park / Bear Lake areas has become more popular in recent years.  Shuttle bus service between the Estes Park Visitors Center and Rocky Mountain National Park started in 2006.  While the shuttle bus is free, you will need to purchase a National Parks pass prior to entering Rocky Mountain National Park.  According to the Visitors Center staff, there is an automated machine available at the Visitors Center from which you can purchase 7-day or annual passes.      Hitchhiking can sometimes be effective particularly if you look like you are making an effort and have good personal hygiene.  Speaking of hygiene, the laundromat in upper Stanley village also sells showers.</field>

However; a lot of people walk right by the transfers because people are in such a rush to get out of the station. The transfers in most stations can be found on the platform just before the exit. If you cannot find the transfer distributor or have any questions at all about metro there’s always an on duty metro expert in the booth which is also near the exit and you cannot miss it. If you plan to go to the Boulevard there won’t be much driving involved other than getting there but you will want to bring your walking shoes because it’s a big place with lots of things to do.</field>

NY Waterway tours have their own bus transportation between destinations. If you stay in local hotels or motels, your own vehicle or taxi service are something of a necessity. Broadway (aka Route 9) is the main north to south route through the village. It is divided into North Broadway and South Broadway by Main Street.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of Disneys Hollywood Studios   Upon entering the park, youll find yourself on Hollywood Boulevard, the parks equivalent of the Magic Kingdoms Main Street, U.S.A.  Shops line both sides of this street, perfect for grabbing a souvenir on your way out at the end of the day.  (Feel free to browse on the way in, though; you can always come back later, or you can have it held for you or delivered to your Disney resort.)  Here, its perpetually the 1930s, so keep an eye out for young starlets, ambitious directors, suspicious policemen, eager autograph hounds, and the likemdash;these Streetmosphere actors play out comedic vignettes throughout the day, and they may just pull you into their stories.  At the end of Hollywood Boulevard, you wont be able to miss the giant conical Sorcerers Hat, the one Mickey wore in "The Sorcerers Apprentice" segment of Fantasia.  Its gaudy and obscures the view of the beautiful Chinese Theater, but its the centerpiece of the park and the most important landmark to remember if you get lost.  As you travel down Hollywood Boulevard, youll find the famous intersection with Vine St., a smaller street that heads off to the left towards Echo Lake.  The next intersection is with Sunset Boulevard, another major thoroughfare that branches to the right.  Here youll find more shops and more Streetmosphere, and looming in the distance is the 199-foot-tall Hollywood Tower Hotel, which houses the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. (Why 199 feet? If it were one foot taller, it would require a blinking red light at the top under federal aircraft regulations.)  Past Sunset, as you approach the Sorcerers Hat and the Chinese Theater, to the right will be a large gateway, through which youll find the Animation Courtyard.  Through the gate and to the left, starting around behind the Chinese Theater, are Mickey Avenue and Pixar Place, where former soundstages have been converted into the Toy Story Mania attraction.  From there, behind the Chinese Theater, you enter the Backlot, and then the Streets of America, where Lights, Motors, Action and MuppetVision 3-D are located.  Commissary Lane connects this area to the plaza around the Sorcerers Hat.  Coming back toward the front of the park, you end up at Echo Lakemdash;just look for the giant Dinosaur Gertie.  The Lucasfilm attractions are nearby.</field>

		<field name="content">Casco Bay Ferry in the Old Port.   Portland, and Maine in general, does not have an extensive public transportation system, so renting a car is generally the best option. While 5 oclock traffic can get a little congested, driving in Portland is not a daunting task.    Metro, 114 Valley St, +1 207 774-0351,   .  Bus line has a regular schedule, and provides a high level of service for a city of its size. Metro is not the best option for late night socializing; there are numerous taxicab companies. Walking is probably the best option downtown and especially in the Old Port or by the waterfront.  The Old Port and Downtown Arts District areas are very walkable and pedestrian friendly. The pedestrian always has the right of way, with or without a cross walk.  This is a state law and is very much enforced.  The punishment for non compliance is a $500 fine and 6 month license suspension.  Maine has a tough OUI (operating under the influence) law which applies to not only cars but also boats, horses, and even lawn mowers.  The legal limit is .08; the standard punishment is 60 days in jail, license suspension for one year, and a $2500 fine for the first offense.  After a second offense, the driver license will be revoked permanently, not merely suspended, and the driver will be fed to a pack of satanic lobsters.</field>

		<field name="content">Lansing is serviced by a number of highways. Travel by car to any part of the city normally takes very little time. Traffic is generally light in the region. While there is some rush hour traffic, visitors driving in the region should not anticipate heavy congestion. The heaviest traffic is concentrated on the east and west sides of the city.   The Lansing-area is serviced by the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) bus system. Visitors should find bus service to downtown Lansing, downtown East Lansing, and Michigan State University a convenient and affordable alternative to driving.  Many companies provide taxi service throughout the area. Taxi service is heavily concentrated in the downtown East Lansing-area, especially during evenings and weekends. There is no need to call ahead for taxis in downtown East Lansing, as an available taxi can always be found on Albert Street behind downtown East Lansing. In downtown Lansing, taxi service is not as frequent. Taxi service usually arrives in under 30 minutes. Visitors should expect longer delays on the weekends and during Michigan State University football games.   The City of Lansing provides an extensive river walk trail along the Red Cedar River and Grand River. Visitors will enjoy strolling along the Red Cedar as it meanders through the beautiful Michigan State University campus, through dense forest, past the City of Lansings Potter Park Zoo, where the Red Cedar joins the Grand River (Michigans largest river) and continues through downtown Lansing, Cooley Law School Stadium (formerly Oldsmobile Park), home of the Lansing Lugnuts minor league baseball team, the downtown Farmers Market, and to the River Walk terminus near the historic Old Town on Lansings north side.   The area offers many bike lanes, especially in East Lansing near the Michigan State University. Whether on foot or by bike, the area offers plenty of sidewalks, bike lanes, and trails to connect pedestrians to all the local attractions.   For visitors arriving or leaving, Lansing is well-connected to the major regional transportation hubs of Chicago and Detroit. The Capital Region International Airport, Amtrak, CATA, Greyhound Bus Lines, Indian Trails, and Michigan Flyer provide transportation services to and from Lansing.  Freeways I-96, I-496, I-69, and US-127 provide fast and convenient connections throughout the Lansing area.</field>

		<field name="content">Automobiles are the primary method of transportation in Somerset. Many of the businesses are located along US 27, which can lead to congestion, especially during rush hour. If you need to travel from the north side of the city to the south side and wish to avoid the traffic, the KY 914 bypass provides a much faster route. The downtown business district lies a few miles off US 27. It is easily accessible from Highway 80 and Monticello Street. US 27 is only road that connects Somerset and Burnside (Burnside is located on the lake and is home to many marinas, boat docks, etc.  Somerset has a small taxi service.</field>

		<field name="content">Newport is a great town to walk, ride, and utilize other modes of transportation besides cars in. When visiting places throughout Newport, youll notice that most people are walking or bikeriding. Many people use bikes, scooters, and mopeds to get around the city. Most of the restaurants and shops are packed into the harbor area, which is perfect for walking, especially on a cool summer night. Parking your car can get pretty difficult at certain times of the year, which is another benefit of walking. If you decide to take your car downtown, there are various locations that have parking meters. The meters take only quarters (15 minutes) and dimes (5 minutes), and allow you to park for 3 hours. In addition to meters, there are many parking lots that charge around 15-30 dollars for parking.   There is also the option of using the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority R.I.P.T.A., Phone: +1 401-781-9400,   . RIPTA has authentic looking trolleys that travel around Newport and offer bus trips all around the state of Rhode Island. Newport Trolley, Phone: (401) 849-8005,   . Sponsored by RIPTA bus company, this more stylish and town like cruiser accommodates the same amount of passengers as a bus on a more breezy, clean and pleasant ride.

Reinken Avenue is the main east-west road through Belen, starting at Main Street and running east over the railyard, crossing the Rio Grande, and ending at a north-south state highway connecting to places across the Rio Grande.  Theres no public transportation in town. However, parts of Belen are quite walkable, especially the "downtown" area along Reinken Avenue between Main Street and the railyard, which is where youll find most of Belens historical structures.

Davis has the highest per capita number of bikes of any city in the U.S.  Its the preferred method of transportation for most students and locals due to the prevalence of bike paths and the relative flatness of the area. Unitrans (the local municipal bus system) also runs quite frequently. For undergraduate students riding is free, for everybody else (including graduate students) one journey costs a dollar.  Downtown Davis is also very pedestrian friendly. The UC Davis campus and the heart of the downtown area run alongside one another and its easy to stroll through both in a couple of hours.  Probably the worst way to experience Davis is by car. The huge numbers of bikers and pedestrians make driving slow and tedious at many times throughout the day.</field>

Indiana has more Interstates (14) than any other state its size, although the original name comes from all the railroad tracks that went through the state.   Amtrak  offers a daily train service from  Indianapolis  to  Chicago  and vice versa.  The fare is reasonable (about 15-25 dollars each way).  The train also passes through  Lafayette  as well as a few other towns along its way to Chicago.  The time of travel is roughly about 4.5 hours as compared to about 3-3.5 hours by car.   South Shore Line  links Northern Indiana to Chicago, stopping at  Hammond ,  East Chicago ,  Gary ,  Ogden Dunes ,  Beverly Shore ,  Michigan City ,  Hudson Lake  and  South Bend . It terminates at Chicagos Millennium Station. The overall travel time from South Bend to Chicago (and vice versa) 2.5 hours. The line utilizes a zone-based fare system, with prices rising based on the distance, and the prices drop slightly on the weekends. The prices range from $3.80 - $10.75 on weekdays and $3.00-$9.00 on weekends.</field>

Parking can be hard to find at times and traffic moves particularly slowly at rush hour.  As the city is small in area, you are probably better off parking your vehicle and exploring the city on foot.</field>

		<field name="title">Antelope Valley</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The street system of the Antelope Valley is a grid oriented to the compass points, although there are some exceptions. Major east-west streets are given English alphabet names while major north-south streets are given number names.  The alphabetic streets begin where Kern and Los Angeles counties meet north of Lancaster. Avenue A runs along the county line. One mile south is Avenue B, then Avenue C, and so on to Avenue T south of Palmdale where the grid system ends because of the San Gabriel Mountains. There are also minor streets using letter-number combinations (Avenue J-4 or Avenue P-8). These streets are spaced at 1/16th mile increments.  The north-south streets have a point of origin called Division Street. Each street divisible by 10 is one mile farther from Division Street, both to the east and west (10th Street is one mile from Division Street, 20th Street is two miles from Division Street). Between these streets are minor streets spaced 1/10th of a mile apart and named incrementally (11th Street, 12th Street, etc.). Location of the street either east or west of Division Street is part of the street name, which means there are often two streets named similarly (10th Street East and 10th Street West, for instance).  Many streets have what might be “normal” names (Milling Street, Fig Avenue) that don’t relate to the major or minor grids. This can be confusing when trying to find addresses in the Valley. (Norberry Street is not near any of the letter N streets, for instance.)  GPS devices can be a big help for anyone not familiar with the street and address layout of the Antelope Valley when searching for a location.</field>

Busing is available during the Granville Harvest Fair (Columbus Day Weekend) to get to primary areas of the Fair. The bus stops are at the Granville Village School, the Old Meeting House, and the third stop that used to be at the Granville Green is now at the old Drum Shop. Signs are used to indicate where these stops are, but if you are not sure, ask and someone will happily point you in the right direction! As the buses used are school buses and not larger common carrier buses, space is limited, so if you plan to go on one, get to the stop early. Timing between bus arrivals varies but should not take more then five to fifteen minutes. Busing ends at the end of each fair day (around five PM).</field>

Barrington is also home to a bike path that runs through some of its more scenic locations such as Brickyard Pond, the YMCA softball field, and through the center of town. This makes it easy to get around Barrington either by bike, walking, running, or driving. Travel by boat along the Barrington River by way of the Yacht Club. Barrington’s waterside location also makes the town easily accessible to Narragansett Bay boaters looking to dock up and grab a bite to eat.   Barrington has a few main roads, from which most of the town can be accessed.  County Road (Rt 114) leads through Barrington center, and turns into the Wampanoag Trail if traveling north, leading to Providence, and leads into Warren and Bristol if traveling south.  Immediately after crossing the border from Warren, Sowams and New Meadow roads are the two main roads which offer access to the northeast neighborhoods of the town, located between Hundred Acre Cove and the Warren River.  Continuing straight towards the center offers access to Rumstick Road, which provides a route to the southern neighborhoods, Barrington Beach, and Rhode Island Country Club.  After passing through the center, Lincoln Avenue features Barrington High School, and access to the western neighborhoods by way of Middle Highway or Washington Road.  No point in town is far from a main road which offers quick access to Rt 114.</field>

Roads: Nearly every city in Utah is laid out on a grid system, a vision of the original Mormon settlers. They generally feature wide roads, with a numbering system consisting of intervals of 100 originating from a central point (for example, heading north from the center, the first road will be 100 North, then 200 North, and so on). This system can be confusing for first-time visitors, but is easy to pick up and familiarize yourself with. The major exception to this is Ogden, which was settled as a non-Mormon railroad town and therefore possesses a different numbering system. Public Transportation: The  Utah Transit Authority (UTA)  maintains a bus system with several routes, generally between Ogden and Provo.  UTA also is responsible for the TRAX system, which is light rail running from the University of Utah to downtown Salt Lake to Sandy.  For both bus and train, one-way fare is $2, and a transfer can be obtained upon request, which will allow you to board another bus or train within two hours. UTA also operates Frontrunner, a commuter train, running between Pleasant View, north of Ogden, through Salt Lake City to Provo. The cost of Frontrunner is $2-$9 one way depending on how far you travel. Fares have change frequently in the past, so check UTA website    for updates.</field>

Even the trip from Buffalo to New York City is only about seven hours—too long for a day trip, certainly, but a weekend trip is doable for the dedicated.  An alternative is to take a small regional jet from one of the upstate cities into New York; more expensive, but the trip is only 45-90 minutes in the air.  Amtrak also runs trains that connect the five major cities for an in-between solution.  If youre headed someplace more out of the way, though, youll probably need to drive.</field>

		<field name="content">The many trails in the forest are generally accessible to hikers, horses, and mountain bikes.  Motorized travel is forbidden in the two wilderness areas, but there are a number of abandoned logging roads outside the wildernesses that are suitable for ORVs and dirt bikes.  (Please operate responsibly; damage in this terrain and climate takes a long time to heal.)  Trails and, to a lesser extent, logging roads in the high country tend to be soggy until June or even July due to snowmelt.  In much of the area, snowshoes are more satisfactory for winter travel than skis or snowmobiles, because of the steepness and narrowness of the trails.  Sparse snow makes all of these means of travel marginal at elevations below 8000 or so.  Although most of the mountains have relatively gentle slopes, there is some potential for avalanche hazard, particularly along the main ridge line of the Sangre de Cristos but also to some extent in the Jemez.</field>

The City of Kenosha offers mass transportation in and around the City including a bus system and limited service streetcars.    Due to the high concentration of lakes in the area, the road system lacks the grid pattern found commonly in the area.  Therefore, it is easy for visitors to become lost, especially in the western portions of the County.</field>

Except for a few wide, flat trails at the ports for NPS equipment, and a little pavement in the Snug Harbor area, there are no roads on the island.  Mountain bikes and wheeled portage devices are not permitted.  As a wilderness area, the park does not meet modern expectations of accessibility.  You need to be able to walk on rough surfaces and steep terrain to get anywhere at all beyond the immediate vicinity of the ports.  At Windigo, even the information office and store are up a short but steep hill.  Wheelchairs are permitted but not actively accommodated; if you rely on one, youll find ferry dis/embarking itself difficult, to say nothing of getting around.  Lakeshore canoeing and sightseeing by boat are the best options for those with limited mobility.  Service animals are permitted, but only with prior arrangements.</field>

There are numerous number of bus lines that come frequently enough that you can travel the city with out a car. Paterson is a major transit hub for Passaic County, and North Jersey. New Jersey Transit provide bus routes into and out of the city. Route 161, 190, and 171 provide service from Paterson to New York City.

Parking is 75cent; per hour downtown, and notably more expensive at the University. On-street parking is available at most hours, except in resident parking areas, and there are some free lots. Downtown Bellingham, though small, is something of a maze, with many odd angles and one-way streets. It may be helpful to have a detailed map handy when navigating this area. Free maps are available at the Visitor Center just off I-5 at exit 253.  Because traffic is relatively light and parking is relatively easy, most locals get around by car. Many students, some ecologically-minded souls, and other people walk, ride a bicycle, or use the local buses operated by WTA   . There is a network of bike and pedestrian paths, with a map available online   . Riding a bicycle upon a sidewalk in a business district is prohibited. Local taxi company Designated Taxi    caters to Bellinghams lifestyle by providing bike racks on all of their hybrid, smoke free, cabs. 360-201-0700  Some Whatcom County roads outside of Bellingham are referred to by locals with a preceding the. Guide Meridian is "The Guide," and so on.      Powered wheelchairs can give some visitors better mobility, but are difficult to transport on airliners. They can be rented from some stores, and a few are available for a donation from the local Lions Club charity.</field>

Major north-south streets are Belt Line Road, Story Road, MacArthur Blvd. and OConnor Rd, and east-west include Walnut Hill Ln., Northgate Drive, Rochelle Rd., Irving Blvd. and Rock Island Road. During rush hour most of these streets (as well as the freeways serving the city) can become quite congested, so plan accordingly. For those who prefer to avoid traffic altogether, Irving is also well served by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or DART   .   Irving indeed has become a victim of any typical western Metropolis urban sprawl, and a car is the best way to get around the city.  However, the city is serviced quite well by DART, the local mass transit system in the Dallas area.  Recently the Trinity Railway Express has begun operating a rail link between downtown  Dallas  and  Fort Worth .  The Trinity Railway Express makes two stops in Irving.  While the fares are surprisingly reasonable ($1.25 to Dallas) the stops are infrecuent, especially on Saturdays and there is no Sunday service.</field>

		<field name="content">Residents of Celebration have to follow a series of rules and regulations set forth by the Supreme Board of Governors in Celebration, and transportation is not left out from those laws. Visitors to Celebration are encouraged to rent out options of transportation to travel within the community. The town is made up of plenty of winding walkways and there are sidewalks for added accessibility. Residents of Celebration must use these options of travel within the community, and residents are encouraged to join in. Transportation and welcome centers in downtown Celebration let you know how to get your hands on:  Neighborhood Electric Vehicles: These vehicles can hold up to 4 people (depending on car type) for travels within the community. They are low speed vehicles and will get you around town quickly, safely, and efficiently.  Segway Human Transporters: Segways are an up and coming form of transportation. Disney uses them thoroughly throughout their parks and resorts for quick access to locations via their Cast Members (employees). A 1 hour class and helmet is required and provided by the city. They have wireless remotes that shut the Segway off if you leave a certain vicinity of town. They can travel up to 12.5 MPH on the highest setting, and provide a new outlook on city tourism. Bicycles: There are a few locations throughout Celebration where you can rent a bike for the day to take in on the scenery. Walking  All of this ties back into Walt Disneys vision of EPCOT, where residents would either rely on public transportation in the form of monorails, or use an environmentally friendly alternative, like the People Mover or traditional walking.</field>

Most businesses have parking lots, and even in the Downtown area there is often plenty of parking on a normal day. The University of Louisiana is usually the only area where visitors encounter parking troubles, but while school is in session a shuttle bus links the center of campus with the massive parking lot at Cajun Field (near the Cajundome and Convention Center), providing a quick commute with frequent service. Bike lanes are becoming a growing trend on some major roads as well. A expanding taxi industry has grown-up around Lafayette recently.</field>

The heaviest concentration of commerce and business is located along Range Line Road (along with the heaviest concentration of traffic). Other "business drags" include 7th Street, Main Street, and 32nd Street.  Main Street is currently undergoing a revitalization effort, with several of the historic buildings being renovated, a new Farmers Market, and the "Third Thursday" Art Walk.</field>

		<field name="content">During the winter, heavy ice and snow are a major concern, which can make driving difficult and slow going. Always check the weather and road conditions    before heading out. Even on a clear winters day, make sure your vehicles wiper fluid reservoir is full. The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)    spreads both sand and magnesium chloride on the roads, which makes for an impenetrable, gluey mess on your windshield.   In the summer months, its not uncommon to see the shoulders of the highways littered with broken-down vehicles that could not handle the steep grades and high altitude air of the Rocky Mountains. If you are venturing from a lower altitude, make sure your car can handle mountain driving. Thinner air means you will be burning more gasoline. Also, with so many steep grades, expect to gear down to avoid unnecessary friction to your brake pads.</field>

East-west streets start at 0 at Austin Boulevard and increment as they head west, reaching 1200 at Harlem. North-south streets include a north-south designation in their addresses. The zero line is the elevated freight/Metra/Green Line track running through the center of the town. Visitors from Chicago are sometimes confused that Madison Street, the north-south zero line in Chicago, is 500 south in Oak Park.  Two local taxi companies serve the Oak Park area: Red Cab    and Blue Cab   . Both companies congregate near the Metra/Harlem Green Line stop. Their dispatch services are professional and fast.</field>

But watch out for those occasional pop up showers, especially during the wet season.  When cycling, be sure to bring plenty of water, wear light weight, light colored clothing, and wear sunscreen. Lee trans    is the local bus service and has numerous bus lines criss-crossing the city. The tolls for the Sanibel Causeway are $6 for cars, $2 for motorcycles, and $0 for bicycles, but it is only going onto the island, and well worth it. The Midpoint and Cape Coral Pwky/Colonial Bridge is $2 going from Fort Myers to Cape Coral only. Other direction is non toll. The bridge is generally unavoidable unless you go through Downtown Fort Myers and US41 around.</field>

Oklahoma State University began operation of a small bus mass transit system in 1997 that has grown considerably and now serves all of Stillwater.  Fares are free to OSU students, faculty, and staff, and only 50¢ cents for the general public (25¢ for seniors and children).  The buses serve all of the Stillwater area, including recreational areas such as Boomer Lake.  The bus system is astoundingly well-run, and very efficient.  For more information on the bus, visit http://www.parking.okstate.edu/RoutesAndMaps.htm   Stillwater is also easily navigated by car, and the city has several car rental agencies.  Highway 51 (6th Street) provides Stillwaters main crosstown East-West route, and US-177 (Perkins Rd.) serves as the main North-South route.  Both offer quick travel from one end of the city to the other.  Stillwater is fairly pedestrian-friendly, especially nearer to the downtown district, but lacks in handicap accessibility in the residential areas, especially near the Oklahoma State campus.  The city is small enough to be completely pedestrian accessible, however increasing sprawl is making it less and less of a viable option.  If no other personal transportation is available, the easiest way to get around is a combination of the bus system and walking.</field>

		<field name="content">Epcot might be the easiest of the parks to get around, because its very open and spacious.  The spaciousness has a drawback, though; because the pavilions are spread out, it can be a long walk from one side of the park to the other.  Spaceship Earth is visible from anywhere in the park and provides a convenient orientation landmark.  Future World is the northern half of Epcot and where the main entrance is found.  From the main entrance, Spaceship Earth is directly in front of you, with Innoventions hiding behind it.  Future World Eastmdash;Universe of Energy, Mission: SPACE, and Test Trackmdash;is on the left side of Future World.  Future World West is on the right and comprises The Seas with Nemo Friends, The Land, and Imagination!  Go past Spaceship Earth and through Innoventions Plaza and youll see the World Showcase Lagoon front of you, with the eleven nations of World Showcase arrayed around the far shore.  From left to right (east to west), the pavilions are Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, The American Adventure, Japan, Morocco, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  The International Gateway, Epcots "back entrance", is between France and the United Kingdom; exit here to get to the BoardWalk and the other Epcot-area resorts, or to Disneys Hollywood Studios.  The World Showcase Lagoon has a circumference of roughly a mile. To make a long trip short, there are two more Friendship ferries (yes, just like the ones you took to get here from Hollywood Studios or the resorts) that traverse the lagoon.</field>

		<field name="content">To get to Uptown Whittier, the citys historic business district, turn left onto Hadley Street and then right onto Greenleaf Avenue. The majority of Uptowns small businesses are on Greenleaf between Hadley and Mar Vista Streets, but youll find other shops and restaurants a few blocks east and west of Greenleaf.  If locally owned small businesses arent your thing, continue to head south on Greenleaf and turn left onto Whittier Boulevard. At the corner of Whittier Boulevard and Painter Avenue, youll find The Quad, a formerly indoor mall. After years of being a ghost town, it was completely redone after the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. Its now like every other strip mall in suburbia, which means theres plenty of parking and chain restaurants.  Still havent had your fill of cookie-cutter corporate America? Continue southeast on Whittier Boulevard until you come to the Whittwood Town Center. Formerly called the Whittwood Mall, this outdoor strip mall was originally an outdoor strip mall.  Following the trend of the time, they enclosed it in the late 70s.  The roofed part of the mall ran from the eastern entrance of Sears (formerly the Broadway) to the western entrance of JC Penney. Where Target now stands used to be more parking, a gym, and a tire shop.  After years of empty storefronts, a plan was hatched to mdash; (are you sensing a trend here?) mdash; tear down the indoor part of the mall.  Bus lines 270, Montebello 10 and Montebello 50 serve uptown Whittier.  Line 270 continues south on Santa Fe Springs Road, while Lines 10 and 50 continue south on Painter Avenue.</field>

Topeka has a controlled access bypass, I-470, travelling through the southwest side of town.  This makes for easy access to shopping centers and connects the major highways going into and out of Topeka.  Topeka has a public bus line that runs through most of the main streets</field>

		<field name="content">You can drive (or, if youre into pain, cycle -- the road gains thousands of feet of elevation) from the visitor center and campground to the upper reaches of the park, where the most interesting rock formations are.  The trails through the formations are all done on foot; no motorized traffic or horses are allowed on them.  The trademark hike at Chiricahua (see under "Do") is from the trailheads at the upper end, one-way back to the visitor center/campground.  To avoid the necessity of leaving a car at each end of this trail (or of hiking back to the top, which again is an exercise in pain), take advantage of the shuttle service operated by the visitor center.  A 14-passenger van takes hikers to the trailheads on top, with departure from the visitor center at 8:30 AM.  Use of this shuttle is on a by-reservation-only basis; get your reservation at the visitor center on the day before youre riding on it, or if youre in a gambling mood, show up at the visitor center promptly at 8:00 and see if theres still space available on the shuttle.  Occasionally a kind-hearted worker at the visitor center will drive a second, later shuttle for stragglers, but you cant count on it.</field>

Youll see what I mean if youve rented a house in Corolla or Avon.  Also, the beaches are less crowded (not that OBX beaches are ever very crowded, thats one of the beauties of the place) as the density of housing is not as high as other areas on the island.  If you are staying in Southern Shores, you might want to think first before you go out in a car on Saturday or Sunday during the summer.  Route 12 (which goes north to Duck and Corolla) is packed with families leaving who have just ended their week of vacation and new families coming in.  Its not impossible but can get quite busy.</field>

Travelers may note that in the springtime, local birds, especially pigeons, are so used to the CTA line (which has been in operation for more than fifty years), that the birds will often walk on to the train at Davis Street, ride the train south to South Boulevard, and walk off the train! Apparently, these birds have learned that the train is an efficient way to get from the center of town to feeding areas in the cemetery next to South Boulevard.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving a car is by far the best way (and likely the only reasonable way) to travel in Plano. However, there is a public transit system, the DART, that connects Plano to Dallas via the red line which ends at Parker Station located at Parker and 75. From there you can take a Bus to lots of areas in Plano.  A day ticket costs US $4.00, $2.00 (Reduced for students with High School ID, Seniors 65+ and Children ages 5-14). Plano is a very large city, and a bike will not allow you to get where you want to be in a reasonable amount of time.</field>

Cherry Street is the main thoroughfare, terminating at Canadian customs and immigration. Signs designate a golf cart zone in town, but golf carts are never seen on the streets.  The presence of US Homeland Security staff and cameras right in this small town tends to reduce serious crime, leaving local police with little to do but enforce the varied but generally very low speed limits in Sumas.

		<field name="content">Little Compton is a small town, but  spread across a big portion of land. Because of this, travelers will desire a car or motorcycle. For the athletic and/or light packers, a bicycle will suffice. Little Compton is a bicycle friendly place because of the long, low sloping roads which travel throughout the area. There arent many hills in Little Compton. Also, there is very little traffic running along Little Comptons main road (Route 77) which makes cycling, walking, and running a more practical means of transportation. If exploring The Commons, walking will suffice as it is in a small area.</field>

		<field name="content">The main downtown strip is pedestrian friendly, and its a 20 minute stroll from there to the beach. Walking to the University of California Santa Cruz from downtown is a little more difficult, with bad or non-existent sidewalks and a very steep climb.   While driving is certainly an option (parking is tight, careful to not get ticketed), Santa Cruz Metro    also provides  bus service.    Santa Cruz can wonderful town for town for cycling but be careful as anywhere drivers are no better here than many places. Around town and along Highway 1 is easy, but roads in the Santa Cruz Mountains are steep, winding and challenging for many cyclists.  Be careful.  Collisions between bicycles and cars are often reported. A number of pedestrian and car collisions have also happened in the downtown area. There is much crime in the downtown area, much is drug related.</field>

		<field name="title">Anchorage</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">While not nearly comparable to the size of major world cities (the city itself is several thousand square miles, but much of it is uninhabited and mountainous), the developed part of the Municipality of Anchorage is fairly spread out and not very walkable—with the exception of the compact downtown area.  Most of Anchorage is built on a grid system originally laid out by the railroad: numbered streets run east-west, starting at First Avenue in the extreme north of the city (at the Port and train depot) and ending up in the mid-hundreds at the south edge of town. Lettered streets run north-south, starting at A Street in the middle of downtown and going up to the west; east of A Street, the street names begin with sequential letters and are named after Alaskan cities and towns ( Barrow , Cordova, Denali, etc.). This makes finding yourself on a map fairly easy, although the system gets less coherent outside of the downtown area. Note that the Seward Highway becomes Gambell and Ingra streets, while the Glenn Highway becomes 5th and 6th Avenues.  Youll often hear Anchorageites use the following terms when describing areas of town. These areas were originally separate communities that merged as the city grew.  Downtown: the historic core of the city located at the northwestern tip next to the waterfront; home to most of the tourist activities, gift stores, hotels, and the railroad depot Midtown: the largely commercial area immediately south of Downtown roughly between 15th Avenue and Tudor Road (becoming more industrial south towards Dimond Boulevard) South Anchorage: Dimond Boulevard and south. Largely suburban and residential with some major commercial development west of the Seward Highway. West Anchorage: the area along the water southwest of Downtown, encompassing the historic Bootleggers Cove and Turnagain residential areas and the famous Earthquake Park Spenard: smashed between Midtown and West Anchorage and spilling over and overlapping the boundaries a bit, it was formerly a separate city and catered to the racier aspects of Anchorage living. Its still a bit of a red-light district, especially along Spenard Road itself. Be careful at night. (The airport is at the extreme west end of the Anchorage peninsula and abuts the southwestern edge of Spenard.) East Anchorage: everything east of the Seward Highway and north of Tudor Road. Mostly residential; little of interest to the tourist except for the universities, hospitals, and (at the extreme northeastern corner) the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Hillside: part of South Anchorage, its everything east of the Seward Highway and south of Abbott Road. Completely residential, and many homes there are on the ritzier side ($350k and up to over $1.5M, where the average home is about $220k). Anchorageites think of the Hillside like Angelenos do of Beverly Hills—if you own a home there, you must be doing well, even if the trees (or your snowmachine trailer) block your view of the lesser people below. Above the Hillside homes is the immense Chugach State Park, popular for easily accessible hiking. (The most-hiked mountain in Alaska, Flattop Mountain, is fairly easily accessed via the Glen Alps parking area at the top of Upper Huffman Road.) Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek: bedroom suburbs north of the city. Residential only, but they provide access to Chugach State Park, especially Crow Creek Pass and Eklutna Lake. Bird, Indian, Girdwood: small communities south of the city along the Seward Highway. Very small, tourist-service oriented.  Anchorages Ted Stevens International Airport is serviced by all of the major national rental car chains as well as a number of independents. A few companies have off-airport locations and may even offer courtesy shuttles (though these shuttles will not pick up from the airport). Renting from these locations avoids the 11-12% airport concession recovery fee and $4.81 per day airport facility fee. If youre renting for more than a few days, it might be worth the hassle to rent your vehicle at an off-airport location, which usually involves taxi rides or shuffling between hotel and rental car courtesy shuttles. Check with each agency or search off-airport rental cars using an online travel agency to see what cost savings may be available.  If youre arriving in the summer, plan ahead, as most rental companies are pretty much sold out from mid-June through the end of August. In the summer, cars are often not available without reservations, and even if they are, be prepared to pay top-dollar for them, especially four-wheel-drive vehicles.  Renting a car in Alaska can be more expensive than pretty much anywhere else in the United States, ranging up to (and occasionally even over) $200 per day for a large vehicle sufficient to carry multiple passengers and outdoor gear during the peak season. In the dead of winter, however, you can sometimes grab a vehicle for under $10 per day.  Some of the major car rental companies serving the Anchorage area are:  Alamo (in-terminal): +1 907-243-3406    Avis (in-terminal and downtown): +1 907-243-2377    http://avis.com Budget (in-terminal and midtown): +1 907-243-0150    http://budget.com Dollar (in-terminal and midtown): +1 907-248-5338    Enterprise (in-terminal, downtown, and midtown): +1 907-248-5526, +1 907-277-1600, +1 907-563-5050    E-Z Rent-A-Car (midtown): +1 907-562-2292    Hertz (in-terminal and downtown): +1 907-243-3308, +1 907-243-4118, +1 907-562-4595    National (in-terminal): +1 907-243-3406    Thrifty (in-terminal and midtown): +1 907-276-2855    http://thrifty.com  Most airport rental agencies are open from about 5:30AM or 6AM to about 2AM (3AM at the latest) in the peak summer season. With the number of red-eye flights serving Anchorage, its especially important to be sure your flight doesnt arrive after your rental agency closes. None of the major chains is open 24 hours, so the only option for after-hours arrivals is a cab or hotel shuttle to an area hotel or to sleep on a bench until the agencies open.  Two main taxi companies serve the Anchorage area: Alaska Yellow Cab (+1 907-222-2222) and Checker Cab (+1 907-276-1234). The airport maintains a taxi stand on the arrivals level. As of late 2007, the municipality-set rate for all taxis is $2 are the flag drop and $2.50 per mile; time based rate $.50 per minute. The average fare to downtown runs about $20 one-way.  Many hotels offer also courtesy shuttle vans that stop at the airport near the taxi stand. Several courtesy phone banks are located inside the baggage claim areas.  If youre determined to save money, you can use the PeopleMover, Anchorages bus system.    As of late 2007, fares are $1.75 per trip or $4 for a day pass. Most bus routes have one bus in each direction per hour, but some routes increase it to two buses per hour during peak times. Buses are frequently late. Route 7A of the PeopleMover, Anchorages bus system, has a stop located at the far south end of the airport taxi stand area. Every hour, there is one bus going downtown and one bus going to the Dimond Center mall in south Anchorage. If youre riding the bus to the airport, note that only Route 7A, not Route 7, stops at the airport. For more information, call the PeopleMover Ride Line at +1 907-343-6543  at    .  Anchorage features an extremely well-developed bike trail system, with over 200 miles (320nbsp;km) of developed trails (120 of which are paved) winding their way throughout the citys parks and three green belts. The popular Tony Knowles Coastal Trail parallels the waterfront from Downtown to Kincaid Park near the airport. Several companies offer bike rentals and trail tours. In the winter, many of the trails are groomed and used as ski trails.  Drivers tend to be aggressive in Anchorage year round, and many of the roads are heavily damaged by severe winter conditions and the use of studded tires.  If you are visiting in winter and not used to driving in winter conditions, be very cautious, do not pass, keep excessive following distance, and allow plenty of time to stop.  If its snowing, no matter what time of the day, have your headlights on (the Seward Highway south of Anchorage requires headlights to be on at all times).  Keep in mind that a roadway covered with black ice may look completely dry but provide no traction whatsoever.</field>

Certain intersections (basically anything along Harbor Drive) can feel a little risky with the high volume of cars, but for the most part walking is quite safe, even at night. Just keep in mind that Downtown is fairly large, so if youre planning on hoofing it from Little Italy to PETCO Park, keep in mind its a long walk.  Taxis are readily available just about anywhere in downtown at night until very late, just flag one down.  A vintage trolley service, the  Silver Line  runs in a clockwise direction around the San Diego Trolley loop within Downtown every half-hour. It operates 10AM-2PM on the weekends and holidays and the fare is $2 ($1 seniors/disabled; trolley passes not valid). This is really only worthwhile if youre interested in riding the old streetcar; otherwise just use the regular San Diego Trolley service.</field>

		<field name="content">The easiest way to get around Richmond is by car.  Roadside parking spaces are relatively easy to find but be in the look-out for no parking areas - particularly the "Fan District." The city is laid out on a grid system and is easy to navigate, however, many streets in the oldest parts of the city are very narrow and one-way.  The Greater Richmond Transit Company, or GRTC   , operates a bus service across the city and partially into neighboring Henrico and Chesterfield Counties.  The average fare is $1.50 for local routes and $2.00 for the express routes, exact change or Go-Cards are the only available methods of payment, you can find Go-Cards at local groceries and convenience stores. The system is best utilized if you are already downtown, and need to go throughout the city itself. Many find it easiest to Park at an all day garage and use one of the multiple lines along Broad street to avoid paying for more parking.</field>

To reach other places, such as the Rushmore Mall, one can use the Rapid Ride System    from the Milo Barber Transit Center. There are four loop routes featuring buses going in both directions about every 70 min around each loop. Fare is $1 and includes a transfer.  If you want to travel before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m., you will have to take a taxi, there are plenty in Rapid City for your needs. Also, there are several travel services that are available for the "night life" to ensure a safe and inexpensive ride home, Scooters and Jonesys Party Bus.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Detroits street layout is truly unique, combining wheel-and-spoke, grid, and strip-farm (near the River) layouts.  Six major spoke roads radiate out from downtown; they are, in clockwise order, Fort Street, Michigan Avenue, Grand River Avenue, Woodward Avenue, Gratiot Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue. Woodward Avenue runs northwest-southeast (more or less) and divides the northern half of Detroit into east and west; West Warren Street, for instance, becomes East Warren Street when it crosses Woodward. Smaller streets generally conform to a strict grid pattern, but the orientation of the grid and the size and shape of blocks frequently varies to fit better with the spoke roads. Downtown, the layout abandons the grid design, with the spoke roads converging in a confusing but oddly logical arrangement of diagonal, mostly one-way streets.</field>

It is relatively easy to walk all of downtown, as it is not very big.  A lengthy bike path, the Bear Creek Greenway, runs along Bear Creek in a north-south direction from Ashland (about a dozen miles south of Medford) through the city and up to the end of Central Point (the northern district of Medford). This scenic route is very level, and runs near several important parts of town, such as the mall, downtown, and commercial districts near both freeway interchanges.</field>

It is incredibly hard to find parking in Hoboken.  Some places to find parking are Sinatra Drive by the Hudson River, or any street named after a president (besides Washington).  The city-run parking garages on Hudson Street and elsewhere are also a good option if youre worried about getting booted. The parking garages generally range from 3-5 dollars an hour and prices jump up if you leave the car over night. Some of the parking garages are also either for Hoboken residents or available in monthly payments only so, read the signs and ask people at the parking garages to double check.  If you must park, read the signs on the street. Make sure that you ARE allowed to park where youre leaving your car. Most streets have one side reserved for Hoboken Residents, that are marked clearly with a green background and white letters.  These are Resident Only parking sides and you must have a resident permit to park theres. Keep in mind that street cleaning restrictions are in effect as well as a time limit of 4 hours for non-residents - after that, you should move your car.  Finding a parking spot is so hard in Hoboken that they sell parking spaces for up to $40,000.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Reunion Tower and the Trinity Railway Express  The simplest and most reliable way to get around Dallas is by car. Public transportation, known as Dallas Area Rapid Transit or DART, has an extensive system of buses and an expanding light rail network. The light rail hits many tourist destinations in the downtown area, but generally works best for commuters. Buses will get you almost anywhere but will usually require multiple transfers and are a slow way to travel. You can get an excellent trip plan by visiting the DART website    or by calling their information phone number (214-979-1111). Tickets consist of either one-way tickets ($1.75 and up) or day passes ($4 at light rail stations) and are generally collected on the honor system; we recommend the day pass because it will probably take you a lot of buses to get where you need to go. Most buses and the entire light rail have service from around 5:00AM to midnight. There are no after-hours buses. Bus drivers will check tickets upon boarding; light rail trains have infrequent random checks that occur most often during rush hour.  The bus system, not unlike in many large cities, can be quite confusing, and trying to get to points downtown may involve a long walk due to one-way streets. The Texas culture and the urban sprawl of the DFW metroplex encourage the use of cars and local will generally be unable to help you use public transportation. The light rail system consists of four lines, is simple to navigate, and connects to several suburban areas. Car rentals are the most convenient for transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenient return policies and locations.  To get from DFW airport to downtown Dallas, take the SkyTrain inside your terminal or a free airport shuttle in the passenger pickup area to Terminal A (there are signs in the vicinity of the baggage claims explaining how to get to DART). Then take the DART bus to Belt Line Station on the Orange Line. The Orange Line will take you downtown, where you can transfer to the other DART rail lines. Alternatively, you can take a DART bus from Terminal A in the opposite direction to CentrePort/DFW Station on the TRE and take a commuter train to downtown Dallas. Be aware, however, that the TRE runs only once an hour during most of the day.  Dallas Taxi    Dallas Yellow Cab   , (1-800-444-6400)</field>

Nonetheless, it is worth it to rent a car to save time and if you wish to visit more remote areas, such as the High Desert and the mountains.</field>

		<field name="content">Like most mid-sized U.S. cities, an automobile is the most convenient means of getting around, with convenient free parking available most places outside of downtown.  Parking downtown can be inconvenient and somewhat costly on weekdays and during major events (e.g. arena concerts).  Walking within the immediate downtown area is pleasant enough in good weather, and generally safe.    Several taxi companies operate in the city, and cabs can be picked up at designated locations such as the airport, or by calling their dispatcher; cabs are usually not hailed on the street, except around the time bars close on weekends.  Pedicabs are also becoming popular within the downtown area, currently operating during special events and weekend evenings.  "The Rapid" bus service    has a terminal downtown, and routes throughout the city and its suburbs, running early mornings through late evenings on weekdays.  Several routes run with less frequent service on Saturdays and Sundays.  The buses are clean, safe, and generally on-time.  Street addresses identify the quadrant of the city by adding NW, NE, SW, or SE after the full street name.  This is the same system used by  Washington, D.C. , but Grand Rapids doesnt have the capitals confusing system of alphabetic and numerical street names.  There are a few numbered streets just northwest of downtown, but most of the numbered streets are from 28th Street and out on the south side; the far north side instead has Three Mile Road, Four Mile Road, etc.  Generally speaking, east-west roads are called "Street" and north-south roads are called "Avenue",  Interwoven bicycle paths and trails make getting around by bike within the city simple.  The city website   has bike route maps to make finding your way around easy.</field>

		<field name="content">Its a good idea to have a car to get around the Lake of the Ozarks.  Public transit is not available.  If you have a boat, you can see most of the best areas via water.  There are taxi companies, as well as water taxis that are available.   Renting a boat is a good idea and makes for a great day of sightseeing and visiting nice waterfront establishments, as well as seeing some very large, beautiful home properties; get a map and plot the waterfront places you would like to go.  Most marinas will charge around $400 for an all day pontoon rental. Many marinas also rent speedboats and personal watercraft, as well.  Be sure to observe No Wake Zones and observe the rules/laws that the marina advises you on- you do not want to be a pullover of the Missouri Water Patrol.</field>

		<field name="content">Although most locals rely on their cars for day-to-day transportation, walking and public transit are well suited for visitors. The major downtown neighborhoods are quite walkable, and many attractions are easily accessible from public transit.  If youll have a car anyway, driving is often the fastest means of getting around. It also opens up destinations that are difficult or impossible to access by public transit. However, having a car in Downtown is often a hindrance where parking is scarce, and the lengthy rush hour is an exercise in frustration.</field>

You can get around by foot or by bicycle if you’d like, walking may take a long time if you are planning on taking a trip to the opposite side of town (tip: if you are planing on walking or bike riding from the West side of town to the East side you are going to pass major highways as well a set of train tracks, be very careful and if possible find another form of transportation. Your next option to get around town is by car. This is probably the best way to get around town, considering the three major highways  and one set of train tracks running through Brunswick, walking or bike riding may be a dangerous choice if you are traveling across town.</field>

The walking distance is short but pleasant. It is quite easy to get to New Hope if you do not want to drive, just check the New Hope website website  , on which you can find alternative means of transportation to New Hope such as a limousine, taxi, or even train. The New Hope railroad, which has been in service since 1891, is a treat to travel on.  It is a fascinating steam engine train, on which tourists can take a ride and enjoy the classic railroad experience.</field>

		<field name="content">The road to the "visitor center" (really just a couple of huts with offices for reservations, etc.) is driveable (if rough) in ordinary cars, except during winter.  Many winter activities, and some in other seasons, will require you to leave your car at one of the parking areas on NM SR 4 and take a Preserve shuttle to the starting point for your activity.  Dont feel too skittish about doing so; this park doesnt have significant problems—yet—with vandalism of or theft from parked vehicles.  (Lock up, anyway.)  If youre doing something that involves travel on foot, hiking boots are a good idea.  If Nordic skiing, be braced for highly variable conditions.  The Jemez Mountains are notorious for snow conditions that place perfect powder, hard ice, and milk-shake-like slush all within 100 feet of each other.  Choose your equipment accordingly; this is a good place for waxless skis, as theyre relatively tolerant of changing conditions.</field>

		<field name="content">The downtown area is compact, and the museums and most restaurants are within easy walking distance of the main hotels and many of the BBs.  Public transportation by  Atomic City Transit  is free and includes both fixed routes and an on-demand service.  Many Los Alamos residents bicycle to work and around town.  Cycling is feasible for visitors as well, but be aware that the town is at an elevation of about 7320 feet (2231 meters) and quite hilly.  Puffing up the hills before youve acclimated to the altitude can be a surprisingly exhausting experience.  Road cycling is popular here, and some competitive road bicycle racers come here to train.  Popular routes include NM 502 between Los Alamos and Pojoaque, and Camp May Road up to Pajarito Mountain Ski Area.  White Rock is nearly a thousand feet lower and about 10 miles (16nbsp;km) away by road; riding to it on a bike can be a thrill, but oh, that hill coming back!  From White Rock you can take a bus back to townsite: Atomic City Transit buses are equipped with bike racks.  Los Alamos County has an extensive trails network that is open to mountain bikes.  The network is especially well developed around townsite, and connects to trails in Santa Fe National Forest and Pajarito Mountain Ski Area.  In summer and fall the ski area offers lift-served mountain biking:  ride the lift up and bike down easy sideslope trails or bomb down very challenging trails designed specifically for mountain biking.  The ski area also has a mountain biking terrain park.</field>

For a taxi you could call Miller Cabs, Turner Vans, or hail Downtown Taxi! cabs on the streets in downtown.   County Commuter buses are effective and go to all points in the city.</field>

Several originate and can provide direct access from the Steamship Authority bus stop at Vineyard Haven.  In addition, in West Tisbury, the parking lot on State Rd. which contains Cronigs Up-Island Market, the West Tisbury Post Office, and Fellas Take-Out acts as a secondary hub for busses further up-island to  Chilmark  and  Aquinnah , as well as for trips cross-island to  Edgartown  (going by the Marthas Vineyard Airport).   West Tisbury is an excellent spot for biking--many roads (including State Rd.) have bicycle paths.</field>

Arlington has an excellent public transportation system, which includes three D.C. area Metro lines, as well two bus systems. Driving an automobile can bring more troubles than it is worth, as many of Arlingtons attractions suffer from a dearth of parking spaces, and the area is notorious for expensive parking tickets.   If you want to explore the suburban areas of Arlington, the area offers many bus options, but a car is also a viable option.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The most convenient way to get around Landisville is by car. If your are not coming in by car, the best options would be to make arangements to rent a car for the duration of your visit. While there is taxi and bus services, they are not frequent in Landisville and would not be a good option for seeing everything that Landisville and the surrounding towns have to offer. If you traveled in by plane there are two car rental companies right in the terminal, Hertz and Avis. If you came in via Amtrak at the Lancaster station, you can take a taxi from the station to Enterprise Rent-A-Car at 1470 Manheim Pike. If you have the capacity to do so, riding a bike around Landisville is another great option to see the sites that the small town has to offer. While this is strongly suggested, there are a lot of hills around the town and might be a little difficult at times. This is a great option to get around Landisville itself, but if your are planning on visiting the other sites near by, it is once again strongly suggested to have a car to get around.</field>

		<field name="content">Car- Warren is fairly easy to navigate by car, Warren does not have many tricks to it, it is not a very big town but the parking is very accessible and available at reasonable prices. When in a car keep in mind that the whole town is based upon two roads, Main Street and Metacom Avenue. These two roads run parallel and there is almost nothing you cannot access via these two roads. Police enforcement is rather strict in Warren Rhode Island so always keep an eye out for your speed on both roads. Metacome is a four lane road with many restaurants and fast food places as well as gas stations. Main Street is a two lane road with mostly houses.  Bike-The scenic means of transportation is by bike, a bike ride through Warren is full of great views as well as many stops along the way, like at Del’s for a lemonade located right off the bike path on Child Street this is a delicious choice anytime. There has been recent modifications to the bike path that make it extend all the way into Touisett which is a very scenic more rural area of the town, great for a nice afternoon ride. Also if you ever get a flat tire you can always stop at Your Bike Shop located right off the bike path near Dels Lemonade and Child St. Also a very fun place to stop and have some fun is Burrs Hill park, which is also located right off the bike path. Burrs Hill park has a great scenic view right on the water of the Warren Town Beach.  Bus (RIPTA)- The RIPTA system is also available in Warren for those who do not have a car; the bus can give access to Providence, Newport and many of the towns surrounding Warren as well as to many places within Warren. The accessibility and location of this town in terms of the tourist attractions is very reasonable and easy to use. One very popular bus stop in Warren is the one located on Main Street in front of Delektas Pharmacy. Many people gather there each day and get a famous coffee cabinet from Delektas and wait for their bus. Also of of Main Street is the park and ride. Located on Vernon street the park and ride is a great place to catch the buss, offering free parking as well as free overnight parking you cant go wrong by using town transportation and helping the environment.</field>

		<field name="content">A car will provide the best option for getting around North Las Vegas, as well as the Las Vegas metro area itself. Cars also tend to be relatively inexpensive to rent in the metro area. Although you may hit the occassional traffic jam, freeways are usually not severely clogged. Because the region is laid out on a grid pattern, navigating is not too difficult in the area.  If you must get around by bus, its not totally horrific in the Las Vegas area as it could be in many western U.S. cities. Bus service in North Las Vegas, as well as Las Vegas and Henderson, is provided by the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC). Fares are $2 per bus ride. However, it may be more useful to purchase a 24-hour pass for $5 when boarding the bus. If you plan to be in the area for a while, RTC also sells a 5-day pass for $20 at many supermarkets and check cashing institutions, but this pass is not available on the bus itself.  Taxi service in North Las Vegas is handled by calling for a taxi and then waiting for it to come and pick you up. Do not expect to hail a cab off the street as though you were in New York or Chicago. Taxis are only plentiful and easily accessable at McCarran Airport, hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, or Downtown Las Vegas where they are queued up waiting for passengers. Outside of these areas, expect to call a cab and generally wait 20-40 minutes for it to come to you.</field>

One can also walk between the different sections, but most opt to use the bus in order to avoid hauling around all of their gear.  It is also possible to take a combination of lifts and ski/boarding runs to move between villages.  Summit County has a free bus system running every 30 min to an hour, depending on the time of day from Copper Mountain to various stops in Frisco.  Buses from the Frisco Exchange depart every 30 min at peak time and hour otherwise back to Copper Mountain, or to Brekenridge, Silverthorne and Dillon nearby.  There is also an early morning and evening bus from Leadville to Copper and back, mainly used by employees who have an early shift.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Getting around Oklahoma City is easy by car. If youre coming to OKC, you will likely want to either rent a car or plan on staying around downtown, because public transportation is rather limited. There is a pretty good bus system around downtown with service to the airport and the cluster of museums and attractions in the northeastern part of the city, but if you want to really explore without renting a car, youll either have to use the not too stellar bus system or call a cab.   If you happen to have or rent a car, then getting around OKC is very simple. The streets are laid out in a grid, with named streets running north and south and numbered streets running east and west. The main thing to remember when driving the city is that when youre on the north side, the numbered streets increase from south to north, while on the south side they increase from north to south. (NW 23rd street is a very different place from SW 23rd street, and you dont want to get them confused.) Aside from that minor issue, navigation is a breeze- there are very few one way street mazes or "Texas Turnarounds" to worry about, and the interstates in town are usually not congested, except during rush hour and construction.  The city is reasonably bicycle-friendly in the Midtown areas of Oklahoma City due to the numerous through residential low-traffic streets. In other areas of the city, bicycle travel is more difficult due to the lack of low-traffic through streets.</field>

The town is quite small and scenic, so unless you have a disability, you will more than likely be compelled to get around without the car.  You will, however, need a vehicle to get to the nearest towns (Frankfort, Bear Lake, Onekama, et cetera) for groceries and supplies not available in Arcadia.</field>

The fairly small (about 5 blocks square) downtown is on the western side of town, near the base of Mars Hill, the location of Lowell Observatory. Both I-40 and the BNSF railroad tracks run roughly parallel to Route 66.  Northern Arizona University is located south of downtown and the tracks, but north of I-40. Here the north-south oriented Milton Road, which becomes I-17, is the main thoroughfare, with Route 66 heading west north of the railroad underpass.  The city is fairly bike-friendly, with many roads having bike lanes. In 2006 the Flagstaff was designated a "Bicycle-Friendly Community" by the  League of American Bicyclists . The  Flagstaff Urban Trails System  (FUTS) includes more than 50 miles of paved and unpaved trails that wind throughout the town and are used extensively for recreation and transportation. One well-traveled FUTS path runs along the south side of Route 66 from downtown to the east side of town.  The Northern Arizona Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority operates  The Mountain Line , fixed-route bus service that extends throughout Flagstaff and carries more than one million passengers per year.</field>

		<field name="content">The east side of Fort Lauderdale, between down town and the beach, is criss crossed with canals. It doesnt matter if you are in a car, on bicycles, or on foot, you have to cross the canals where the bridges are.  This is one town where a good map can save you a lot of backtracking.  Surprisingly the best road map of the East side of town is the Dolphus Waterway Map".  The US 1 does NOT intersect with Las Olas Boulevard. Your map is wrong if it says otherwise.  The US 1 passes under the river in a tunnel and goes under Las Olas too, re-emerging only at Broward Blvd. to the north.  This confuses many people who are trying to navigate around Fort Lauderdale.</field>

		<field name="content">President Johnsons political career (1946-1969) mirrors the golden age of the American automobile.  Thus, nearly everything at LBJ NHP is accessible with an average, well-maintained sedan.  Texas became known for having good roads during the mid-20th century.  In fact, the thousands of miles of asphalt and concrete linking Texas became necessary for commerce and travel across the second largest state in the union in terms of land area.  One of those roads, U.S Highway 290, links the park sections and the park area with the rest of the state.  Visitors to the LBJ boyhood home in Johnson City can park along the street in front or along the sides of the house, or in the parking lot of the Parks Headquarters roughly two blocks away.  Ranch visitors must take a bus tour, which leaves from the State Park Visitor Center, accessible by a paved Texas state park road just a few hundred yards from U.S. Highway 290.  The bus tours leave from the Visitor Centers back steps and pull within steps of sites of interest on the ranch.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">By car, snowmobile, boat, bike, ATV, floatplane, or on foot.   There are two main paved roads in town (201 15), many snowmobile trails, and dozens of dirt roads primarily built used by the forest industry.   Today, most travel is of course motor driven.  Historically, the Native Americans and European Colonists travelled by water, however, given the impassibility of the woods.  The Kennebec/Chaudière watersheds define the region. Jackman is set at the headwaters of the Kennebec River, which is the watershed that drains the center of the state.  The two mains lakes in the towns boundaries, Attean Lake and Big Wood Lake are both a part of the Moose River, a tributary of the Kennebec.  The Moose flows east from Jackman into Moosehead Lake (the largest in Maine, near  Greenville ) and then into the Kennebec which flows out of Moosehead to the southeast back past a small town called The Forks (year round population about 30, base for the rafting industry in the area, located about a half hour south of Jackman on Route 201, where the Dead River Kennebec converge.)  The Kennebec River then continues south to Skowhegan and  Waterville , past the state capital  Augusta , to the sea.  Immediately to the north is the Chaudière watershed, which flows into the St. Lawrence. There is a coalition of the Maine and Quebec Tourism offices which may be of interest, the Kennebec-Chaudière International Corridor   .  The Native Americans would winter on the coast, and travel by canoe inland in the spring to the headwaters of the Kennebec to hunt and gather other resources.  Mount Kineo on Mooosehead (near Rockwood, 30 minutes to the east of Jackman) was a primary source for flint, for example.  Most of the Rivers (not to mention many other place names in Maine) are derived from Native American names that describe the place, as a sort of trip tik or description of the locale. The name "Kennebec" signifies "where alewives are cured" - in reference to a place on the river (probably near or on the coast) where  the Native Americans dried fish.  The many other names of Native American derivation in Maine have similar meanings.  The Post Colonial era just as fascinating.  In 1775, Benedict Arnold led an expedition of 750 men by boat up the Kennebec by Jackman, then onto the Chaudiere in a failed attack on Quebec City.    In 1853, Henery David Thoreau took a train to Greenville, and then canoed from Greenville, by way of two mile long portages, to Bangor.  His guide was a Penobscot Indian named Joe Attean, his name being the same as that of Attean Lake, in Jackman (the derivation of the name is probably from the French name Etienne, or Steven, which shows how the three cultures, Native, French and English, melded). Note that Jackman is at the head of that same watershed, and that if you are willing to portage two separate one mile portages, you can canoe from Jackman (or Greenville, say) all the way to either Bangor (down the Penobscot watershed) or St. John, New Brunswick ("up" the Allagash onto the St. John watershed) to the sea.    The above is only mentioned by way of describing what has been done by ancients and heroes. It is in no way an endorsement or suggestion. It would take roughly two weeks a bit of logistical support to canoe from Jackman to Bangor (say) - a radical trip.  Just know it can be done.</field>

However, visitors arriving by plane would be well advised to rent a vehicle or arrange for other private transportation as, except in parts of Charlotte and the Triangle, public transportation is limited.  Additionally, visitors should note that mountain roads in the states western areas can sometimes be unpaved and, in winter months, extra caution is advised.  Parts of the Outer Banks are inaccessible by car and can only be accessed either by the North Carolina ferry system or by private boat.</field>

There are two car rental firms in Homer: Hertz, Adventure Alaska. Hertz and Adventure Alaska also have rentals in Anchorage so if you want to rent a car in Anchorage and drive to Homer you can drop your car off and fly back to Anchorage. Anchorage is the main city in Alaska where most flights from outside the state end up. From there you fly or rent a car and drive to the next town. Homer is a 40 minute flight from Anchorage or a 4-5hr drive. There are two 24 hour taxi companies in Homer. Short in-town rides are about $5 per car-load, expect to pay about $15 to go between the town and the Spit.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of the Magic Kingdom   Upon entering the park, youll find yourself on Main Street U.S.A., and though there are plenty of shops here, your eye will no doubt be drawn right to the magnificent Cinderella Castle.  The centerpiece of the Magic Kingdom sits at the end of Main Street, and the circular area in front of it serves as the hub of the park, from which you can get to all of the other lands.  From the hub, Adventureland can be reached via the leftmost path, followed by Liberty Square moving clockwise.  Fantasyland is straight through the castle, and Tomorrowland is off to the right.  You can get to Frontierland via either Adventureland or Liberty Square.  The lands, with the exception of Main Street, are also all connected around the perimeter of the park, away from the hub.  If you dont want to walk, you have a couple of options.  At times, but less often these days, youll find a horse-drawn trolley running up and down Main Street, which you can hop to get to and from the hub.  More reliably, youll find train stations at Main Street, Frontierland (near Splash Mountain), and Fantasyland (in Storybook Circus), where you can board a train for a scenic narrated journey around the perimeter of the park.</field>

It is a popular option to use the bridge on the northern end of the island and one of the ferry terminals as entrance and exit points when exploring the area.  By boat it is a nice stopping point when traveling between Seattle and the San Juan Islands.  The section of Puget Sound east of Whidbey is known as the Whidbey Basin and usually provides calmer water than traveling on the open sound.</field>

During rush hour on weekdays and many times on weekends traffic can be heavy on SR 443 between its eastern end at US 209 and the area of the Carbon Plaza Mall a few miles west.  Traffic on US 209 on the Thomas McCall Bridge is often heavy also, especially Friday and Saturday nights, consider using Bridge Street through Weissport as an alternative.</field>

		<field name="content">Being largely suburban, a personal vehicle remains the most common method of getting around Santa Rosa and the surrounding area.  There is, however, the  Santa Rosa CityBus , but frequency, operating hours, and coverage leave much to be desired.   Sonoma County Transit  and  Golden Gate Transit  also provide service in Santa Rosa, but focus mainly on inter-city travel.  Bicycling in Santa Rosa is a reasonable option.  Most destinations are reachable via not-too-busy roads, and notable car-free pathways exist from downtown to and beyond the western city limit.  The primary off-street bicycle and pedestrian path system is the Prince Memorial Greenway, extending along the banks of Santa Rosa Creek from City Hall in the heart of downtown, out beyond the city to the west.  On the western edge of downtown, near the Marriott Hotel in Railroad Square, this connects to the Joe Rodota Trail, a paved off-street path going to Sebastapol paralleling CA highway 12.  Much of the city is relatively flat.  The downtown core is easily walkable, and if one were staying downtown they could conceivably while away a day on foot.</field>

		<field name="content">Walking is not only the best method, but also the only method for exploring the downtown area. The Baltimore Street commercial district is closed to traffic and is a pedestrian-only mall. Within a few blocks of this area, one can easily walk to the Canal Place Heritage Area, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, the Washington Street Historic District, as well as a variety of other shops and restaurants. It is important to note that while it is possible to walk from the train station to the only downtown hotel, the Holiday Inn, one has to cross a high-traffic section of railroad tracks to access the hotel as well as the rest of the downtown area.  In order to explore the rest of the city and region, however, having a car is advised. Be aware that in the downtown area, parking can sometimes be difficult to find. One public parking garage is available: the Center City Garage on the corner of Pershing and George Streets.  There is also a small parking lot accessible from Liberty Street, but the parking garage at this location is now by permit only. There is visitor parking at the Western Maryland Station on Mechanic street, and metered parking under the Crosstown Bridge (I-68), and along many side streets.</field>

Walking is the best way to explore the town.  Bicycles are another good option, especially for those wishing to visit the wineries and other attractions a little farther from the center of town.  Bicycles can be rented at The Calistoga Bike Shop   , which also dispenses tips and route advice.  The Bike Shop can also arrange "Calistoga Cool Wine" tours, with arrangements for the shop to pick up and deliver any purchased wine, so the bicyclist is not weighted down.  A relatively new bike path connects the eastern end of Washington Street to Dunaweal Lane, providing easy, car-free access from the center of town to several wineries, including Sterling, Twomey, Clos Pegase, Paoletti and Cuvaison.</field>

Aside from route 111 which comes every 15 to 25 minutes, other bus routes are much less frequent.  Taxis are regulated by Sunline Transit Agency  . Taxi fares have a maximum base rate of $2.50 plus $2.96 per mile. Any taxis stopping at the airport in Palm Springs have a $2.50 surcharge. There are a number of private taxi companies serving Indio. Distances in the Coachella Valley are far apart, so be prepared for a hefty price if you are taking a taxi from Indio to Palm Springs or Palm Desert.  The  City of Indio  has an extensive bicycle route plan which connects to other desert cities. As the city is mostly flat, bicycling is a relatively easy way to get around.  There are a few Car Rental agencies in Indio. Hertz has a local branch at 81246 Highway 111 in Indio. Enterprise also has a local rental office at 82360 Highway 111.</field>

Within the city proper, the main arterial streets are Main Street (LA 10), New Roads Street (LA 10), Parent Street-Morganza Hwy (LA 1).  New Roads offers ample parking space along Main Street and Morrison Parkway.  There is also a lot behind the courthouse on Main Street (accessible via Alamo and Court Streets) and large lot behind the post office (accessible via Main Street) Be advised, rush hour traffic on Main Street can be highly annoying, so try to travel during the middle of the day during the week and early or late on weekends.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving around Key West is difficult and parking is expensive. (Although there is free parking in front of the USS Mohawk Museum, at the intersection of Southard St and Fort St.) Many visitors choose to rent motor scooters, bicycles, golf carts or explore on foot.    When renting a golf cart keep in mind that you have to find parking for this vehicle as well. Scooters and bikes can normally be parked on the sidewalk right outside your destination.  However, really consider insuring anything you rent.  The main street in Key West is Duval street.   There is a fairly comprehensive bus system with color-coded lines   . Unlimited travel tickets are available for periods between 7 days and a month and are good value.   Fares: (Discounts are available for senior citizens, students etc.)  :Single Trip: $2 :7-Day $8/Unlimited Use  :31-Day $25  If you plan to rent a car be aware that both Enterprise and Alamo desks are not located at the airport.  You have to call the shuttle bus and wait for 12 minutes to catch a ride to the Truman Ave location. Budget is the only car rental agency in Key West that does not charge additional fees (usually $10/day from anyone else) for a second driver -- so if you are traveling with a partner who drives, be advised.  One Key West Taxi Service is reached at 1-305-295-5555.</field>

		<field name="content">As the historic base of the U.S. auto industry, Michigans intrastate travel system is almost entirely dependent on the internal combustion engine.  The most extensive public transit system is the  Greyhound bus network , which reaches most population centers in much of the state. Amtraks three daily rail routes from Chicago connect certain cities in southern Michigan (see "Get in").  Most intrastate air service is out of Detroit Metro; there is no regular service between the states small regional airports.  Several of the larger cities have local bus services (Detroit also has light rail), but the personal automobile remains the best way to get around within Michigan.  Interstate, US, and state highways permeate southeast Michigan, crisscross the rest of southern Michigan, stretch up into northern Michigan, and trickle across the Upper Peninsula.</field>

Bus, subway, rail commuter, taxis and freight services are all accessible to and from Des Plaines.  The Metra Train Service    provides Des Plaines commuter train service to downtown Chicago. The Union Pacific Northwest Line is the Primary route that goes through Des Plaines.  Bus service is provided by Pace Northwest Division Bus Service   .  The Subsidized Taxi Program is designed to provide low-cost transportation to corporate Des Plaines residents who are 65 years of age or older and disabled residents.  Your card is your identification and is to be shown to the taxi driver when you use the cab.  To be eligible for the reduced fare you must travel within corporate city limits of Des Plaines only, with the exception of Advocate/Lutheran General Hospital campus. The City will pay half of the metered fare as long as the cab meter does not exceed $5.00. If it does exceed $5.00, the City’s contribution is limited to $2.50.</field>

There is also parking by the National Parks boat launch, as well as the Life of the Forest and Life of the Dunes trails. Parking by the campsites is strictly restricted to campers with permits.  The park service allows Over Sand Vehicles (OSVs) to drive on the beach with a seasonal permit (predominantly used by locals), which unfortunately will spoil any thoughts you had of a pristine walk on an unspoiled beach, or for that matter, peaceful, isolated beach camping. Edward Abbey would be appalled.  Bicycle lanes are present leading across the Verrazzano Bridge to the island, and then run south all the way to South Ocean Beach in the National Park.  Otherwise, youre strolling along the gorgeous beach!</field>

		<field name="content">By Car The easiest way to get around Fond du Lac is by car. The city is generally easy to navigate, and traffic rarely gets heavy. However, the city is crossed by numerous railroad tracks. Be prepared to wait for passing freight trains.   By Bus Fond du Lac has a small public bus service running Monday-Friday, until 6pm. Bus fare is $1.25. Service is very limited.   By Taxi A couple of taxi services do exist in the city. Taxis must be called for ahead of time.   By Bicycle Fond du Lac is at the bed of what used to be Glacial Lake Oshkosh. As such, it is almost entirely flat; making bicycling a very good option. While the city streets have no designated lanes for bikes, most traffic is used to cyclists. Note that bikes are not allowed to be ridden on sidewalks in the citys downtown.   On Foot Visitors looking to travel mostly on foot should expect to do a lot of walking. The city is relatively large. Also note that many sections of the city lack sidewalks or proper pedestrian crossings.</field>

It is a nice, paved trail, that runs along an old train track path and will connect San Bernardino to Claremont. The path, for the most part, is fairly well lit and travelled by bicyclists, skaters, and pedestrians. Walking Much of Fontana is still spread out over several miles. Walking may not be the best way to get from A to B, but downtown Fontana can still give you the chance to wear a hole in your shoes while experiencing some of the local flavor.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown is probably the only part of L.A. that one can reasonably cover on foot.    Metro Bus  is the most extensive bus system in the region. All major streets have at least one (and in some cases, several) bus lines running daily. Base fare is $1.50 and an unlimited-use day pass costs $5. Both can be purchased on board any Metro bus.    Metro Rail  is the subway and light rail system for Los Angeles County. Downtown LA can be traversed using the six downtown rail stations that are served by four of the five lines in the Metro Rail system. At the northern end of Downtown LA, the Gold Line stops at Chinatown on its way northeast to Pasadena. The Red and Purple Line subways meet with the Gold Line light rail in Union Station, where connections can be made to buses, Metrolink commuter trains, and Amtrak. From Union Station, the Red and Purple Line subways run along Hill Street, making stops at the Civic Center and Pershing Square, before turning west under the Financial District. There they connect to the Blue Line light rail at 7th/Metro Center. From there the Red and Purple Lines run northwest and west, respectively, and the Blue Line runs south through Downtown LAs redeveloping South Park district, with a stop at Pico, towards the city of Long Beach.    DASH  is a shuttle service run by L.A. Department of Transportation. When your feet get tired or to better expand your travel area use the DASH. It has several convenient routes that whisk you to almost all of the worthwhile spots Downtown. A ride currently costs 50 cents (25 cents for seniors) and pamphlets are available from most MTA stations (Union, 7th/Olive) and convenience stores Downtown (spotty weekend and after-hour service though).</field>

		<field name="content">By car  By far the best way to see the park is with your own vehicle.  Roads wind extensively throughout the battlefields, and include many places to pull off and allow visitors to walk around.  Use caution when using these roads, as there may be many people walking or bicycling on these roads.  The speed limit throughout the park is 15 MPH. When in your car, you may navigate by map or purchase a CD at several locations throughout Gettysburg that will orientate you to the battlefield.  By bus  Guided tours on buses are available for fees of $22-25 for adults, and $12-15 for children aged 4-11.  More information can be found at the tour bus website.    There are several different types of bus tours — ones with Licensed Battlefield Guides and ones with headphone narration.  By bike If you have the time and have an average level of fitness, bikes can be rented reasonably in Gettysburg and can provide an enhanced experience in the park. Cycling the major sites of the July 1-3 campaign can be completed in one day and allow the visitor to experience battle lines and topography in a much more realistic fashion than car or bus.  By horseback The battlefield features a couple horse trails where you can either bring your own horse or rent one from places around town, including Artillery Ridge Campground and Hickory Hollow Horse Farm.  By Segway There are two places in town — SegTours, LLC and Segs in the City that lease Segway personal transporters for battlefield and town tours. Some feature a licensed battlefield guide.  By foot One of the best ways to tour the battlefield is by foot — either running, walking or hiking. There are 26 miles of roadway and several hiking trails, both flat and rugged.</field>

		<field name="content">Local and state roads connect most parts of the mainland portion of the park, so cars or bicycles are the most practical way of getting from one to another.  One potentially confusing road is M-22, which goes up the west side of the Leelanau Peninsula then comes down the east side; make sure you know which leg youre on and which leg your destination is on.  The islands are accessible by private motorboat or by commercial ferry:  Manitou Island Transit, P.O. Box 1157, Leland, MI 49654 (several miles north of the mainland part of the park, on the west leg of M-22) +1 231-256-9061.    From mid-June thru Labor Day, they offer daily transportation to South Manitou (with a 4.5-hour layover at the island, also suitable for day-trippers) and Su/M/W/F/Sa to North Manitou (no layover, so its for campers only), as well as sunset cruises and scuba expeditions.  In early summer they operate on a less frequent schedule, and in the fall they run a single ship to both islands on Su/W/F.  Closed from the end of deer-hunting season thru April.  Reservations recommended.  $29 round-trip to either island.</field>

Buses do run to the Ocean County Mall and the downtown area which is a pretty place to walk around. New Jersey Transit Bus service is located near down town Toms River. Express buses leave for the New York City every hour, and take about an hour and twenty minutes to get to NYC depending on traffic. You can also take the bus to Atlantic City.  If you plan on visiting the beach area over the bridge, there are places to rent single and multi-person bikes to get around for the day.  There are a number of taxi services around and within Toms River. Fares vary depending on the service:   Alpha Taxi - Toms River, NJ, +1 732 506-9500   Ace Cab - Toms River, NJ, +1 732 736-1600   Checker Cab Co. - Toms River, NJ, +1 732 736-6799   Yellow Cab - Toms River, NJ, +1 732 349-1211   East Star Express - Toms River, NJ, +1 732 552-1044      Boating on the Barnaget Bay</field>

The logging roads throughout much of the forest are still usable and are moderately used year round by hunters and outdoors enthusiasts.</field>

The island is perfect for biking and walking, not to mention the fact that the entire island is accessible by golf cart.  Be sure to use caution while driving on Isle of Palms.  The local police force is snide and unfriendly, often acting militaristic in their enforcement of public safety and road regulations. A parked vehicle left hanging half an inch past the line will likely net you a parking violation ticket.</field>

		<field name="content">Hull is a narrow peninsula and therefore has one major road in and out, Nantasket Ave. Hull is surrounded by two waterfronts, the "beach side" and "bay side". Most neighborhood streets run in a grid-like fashion leading to either the bay or beach side, and cross over Nantasket Ave which runs down the middle of the peninsula. One can travel Nantasket Ave. all the way to the tip of Hull, known as Hull Gut, which is where the local high school, ferry and windmill are located. A good view of Boston proper can be seen across the channel.</field>

Bicycles and Mopeds are also available to rent and are so convenient that you may rent one as soon as you walk off the ferry.

Hole in the Rock Road offers access to the heart of Escalante and numerous trailheads, however it comes to a dead end at the north rim of the Colorado River.  The dirt roads in the area can become impassable when wet due to the clay.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving is by far the best way to get around the Pensacola area. With the exception of downtown or a few historic areas of interest, parking is plentiful and cheap. Downtown has street parking and a few parking garages. Most streets run north-south/east-west. A few of the major streets change names as they run through the city, one of the most notable ones being (from east to west) Bayou Blvd, Brent Lane, Beverly Pkwy, Michigan Ave, and Saufley Field Road. A map might come in handy in some of the areas near the Navy Base. A good rule of thumb is that you will eventually run into some sort of water whether you go east, south or west in town.  There are bicycle lanes throughout town, but most people will not notice them unless they are actually using them for their intended purpose. Downtown Pensacola is great to see from a bike, especially the old Seville area. Pensacola Beach has designated walking/biking paths that are usually much safer.  ECAT is Pensacola and Escambia Countys transit service.    It provides bus service to a county-wide area, stopping at local shopping centers and hospitals.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of Downtown Denver   Numbered streets run east-west in the north half of the metro area, including suburbs. Ellsworth Avenue is the "equatorial" street. Numbered streets increase as you travel north and are generally called avenues. Avenues south of Ellsworth are named. Named streets run north-south. Broadway is the "meridian" street. Ordered alphabetically going up as you travel east or west away from city center. Addresses on named streets correspond to intersecting numbered streets, so "1701 Broadway" is at 17th and Broadway. North-south streets are generally called streets, not avenues.  Downtown streets: The diagonal layout of the downtown area can be tricky, especially for first-time visitors. North of Colfax and west of Broadway, the streets are canted 45 degrees from all other streets in the city. The transition between the two systems is confusing even for locals. Southeast-northwest streets are numbered, while southwest-northeast streets are named. As this was the original grid system of Denver, some vestiges of it exist outside of downtown, creating diagonal cuts in certain parts of the city. Some of those streets include Park Avenue, Speer Boulevard and Morrison Road.</field>

It is no more than a 10-minute walk between any two adjacent terminals (with the obvious exception of 1 and 8). If you are transferring between directly adjacent terminals, walking is nearly always quicker than the shuttle.  Note that security-side transfers between terminals are extremely limited at LAX. Only Terminals 5, 6, 7, and 8 are linked on the secure side into a single complex so that passengers in any one of the four can go to the other without having to pass through security again.</field>

A few blocks east is Railtown 1897, a state historic park (and a branch of the California Railroad Museum in Sacrmamento). An area just west of downtown on Highway 108 has more restaurants (and best reached by car), and there is also an interesting historical site about a mile west of downtown, Woods Crossing, that definitely requires a car to get to.</field>

The two main roads in South Hero are Route 2 and County Road 314 otherwise known as Ferry Road. Route 2 will take you across the Sandbar Bridge into the mainland of Vermont while 314 will take you to  Grand Isle ,  North Hero  and  Alburg . Most people use cars to travel around while others will take the occasional walk or bike ride along the shoreline. Since youre on a lake, boat travel is very popular. With the right amount of gas, you can get from the southernmost point of South Hero to  Burlington ,  Plattsburgh  or  Mallets Bay  in a little over a hour.</field>

		<field name="content">A car is necessary for traveling the canyon, though most of the community can be easily reached on foot or bicycle. Be aware that many people tire more easily at higher elevations and plan accordingly. Bicycling in the canyon can be very difficult, due to the steep grades and sharp curves and the relative lack of shoulder between the road and river. Buses routinely transport rafters during high water season, but no public transport exists. Most passerby are very friendly toward hitch-hikers, however, and, in season, a shuttle exists to ferry concert-goers from public parking near the mouth of the canyon to the Mishawaka Amphitheatre.</field>

		<field name="content">On the northwest side, Quincy begins at Gansner Park at Spanish Creek on Highway 70. Then there is the Gansner Field Airport. But before this there is a turnoff West to Feather River College on Golden Eagle Ave. Highway 70 is now called Crescent Street from here to downtown. As you get closer to downtown you will notice a giant white building up ahead which is the Plumas County Courthouse. Right before you get there the street splits up to 2, 1-way roads and turns left. The east-bound road is Main Street and the west-bound road is Lawrence Street. Right after it splits up, there is another intersection which Main Street turns into Bucks Lake Road which goes out of town toward the hospital, Meadow Valley, and Bucks Lake which goes West. Going East on Main Street is downtown Quincy where you will see many small shops, restaurants, etc. If you are heading toward Plumas County Museum, you will want to go behind the Plumas County Courthouse to Jackson Street. Across the street from the museum on Jackson Street is the Plumas County Library. Going East on Main Street you eventually get to the Post Office on the left side. The Post Office is in the middle of Main Street and Lawrence Street (which is the west-bound road). A little farther down Main Street you will get to where Lawrence Street and Main Street come together again and form the 2-way Main Street again. A short distance from there is the shopping center on the right side and the stop lights. On the left side is the High School. Going past that you will start climbing up a short hill and over and back down and now you are in East Quincy. East Quincy has the Plumas County Fairgrounds which is the turnoff on the left-side. East Quincy also has a shopping center on the left and more shops, restaurants, etc. Past East Quincy and you will be on Highway 70 going East toward Portola, CA and it ends at Highway 395 which goes to Reno.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Phoenix is a very car-centered city.  If you plan to stay or visit any of the cities on the periphery of the metro area, a rental car will likely be required.  However, if you plan to stick to the Tempe-Downtown Phoenix area, the Light Rail is a viable option, with an all-day adult pass running roughly $3.50.  Taxis are typically fairly easy to find in proximity to major Light-Rail stops and in popular areas, and will run you from $10-15 for a fairly local trip to well over $100 for a ride to a distant suburb.  Surface roads are usually easy to navigate. The areas roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them.  Nearly all streets run with the compass directions, and theres a major thoroughfare every mile in each direction.  This also applies to the extended metro area, though addresses in places like Tempe and Mesa are not based on downtown Phoenix.  There is an extensive network of freeways, most built since 1987. Note: Heavy construction on some segments and interchanges continues. Check construction schedules and closures in the local media.  Drinking and driving is very heavily enforced in Phoenix, especially in Scottsdale and Tempe. Harsh DUI laws police traps ensure you will most likely be pulled over during peak bar hours 11PM-2:30AM.  Mandatory jail time and extremely heavy fines make drinking and driving a very unwise decision in Maricopa County.    Valley Metro . Extensive metropolitan bus system, and light rail line. The light rail line runs from north-central Phoenix, along the Central Ave. corridor, through downtown, past the airport, and to Tempe and Mesa. One-ride or all day passes may be purchased at varying prices depending on service and location; but generally range from $0.85 to $7.25, with the highest being an all-day pass purchased on an Express Bus.   Car rental is the most convenient form of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times.   Car Hire Unlike most cities, in Phoenix you can get a sedan, SUV or even a limo to pick you up for about the same price as a cab.</field>

		<field name="content">By far the most reasonable way to get around Minnesota is to, unfortunately, rent a car. In the unlikely event youve traveled this far away from MSP International without renting a car, all three of the major national car rental firms have locations in nearby Vadnais Heights.  Taxi  As of 2012, it has become increasingly reliable and fast to order a taxi in White Bear Lake at most hours.  Suburban Taxi 651-222-2222 regularly maintains drivers in proximity to the area.  Pauly the Cabbie 651-248-7545 is based in White Bear Lake.  However, in the old days, it was normal for Suburban to claim they would "Have someone there in 15 minutes!" no matter how many times one called them back over the course of HOURS to check on the status of the cab they ordered.  Similarly, Pauly the Cabbie stops taking fares at around 1AM...ideally. However, many times he is too busy to take your fare if even if you call well before then, and he does not make scheduled pickups.  There are many other Twin Cities taxi companies that reportedly serve White Bear Lake, yet there are few reports of their reliability.</field>

		<field name="content">Starting in the west, the major north-south arteries are Penn Avenue, Lyndale Avenue, Nicollet Avenue, Portland Avenue, and 12th Avenue. There are two major east-west arteries in Richfield. 66th Street cuts across the north side of Richfield, linking with Southdale Mall in Edina to the west and Highway 77 to the east (adjacent to Cedar Point Commons, a major strip mall development anchored by a Super Target and a Home Depot). Cutting across the south side of town is 76th/77th Street, which runs close to Interstate 494 and acts as an alternative to it. Specifically, traffic runs along 76th Street from Centennial Lakes in Edina until just east of Interstate 35W, where traffic jogs one block south to 77th Street, which eventually dead-ends at Cedar Avenue (a street that effectively acts as a service road for Highway 77).  Sidewalks are found on major streets; thoroughfares with less traffic like 12th Avenue, Bloomington Avenue, and 70th Street only have them on one side of the street. Non-major residential streets dont have sidewalks at all.</field>

Cars are not required to get around Moscow, the town is fairly small and if youre willing to bike or walk, you can get almost anything done here.  If you do need a car,  there are car rental services available at the Airport,  Budget (509)332-3511 and Hertz (509)332-4485, and in town (Ambassador Auto, 1-800-422-0297). Enterprise Car Rental (208-746-2878) is available if you fly into Lewiston.  There is a bike trail between Moscow and  Pullman .  Bicycles are a common mode of travel in summer, but not in winter, due to the colder, wet weather. In the summer, it is very common for residents to bike-commute back and forth to work between Moscow and Pullman.   There is also a bike trail between Moscow and Troy, to the East.  There are, at any given time, two to three taxi services in Moscow.  There is significant turnover as they go out of business.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown map   Overview map   Santa Fe has a small but vibrant downtown that is not only walkable, but walked, often, by many people late into the nights, particularly in summertime when the tourists flood in.  Parking can be a problem during the summer, but look for parking lots (fee) near St. Francis Cathedral, the new Convention Center, and between Water and San Francisco Streets west of the Plaza.  If in town for the Santa Fe Indian Market, plan on parking away from downtown and taking a shuttle, e.g. from De Vargas Mall.  Limited, but improving, public transportation is available at other times via  Santa Fe Trails , the citys bus service.   The North Central Regional Transit District  "Blue Buses" provides free bus service Monday through Friday with routes that connect the counties and communities of Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Rio Arriba.  The main roads through town are St. Francis Drive (US 84/285) from north to south, Cerrillos Road (NM SR 14) from the downtown area southwest to I-25 and beyond, Old Santa Fe Trail and its offshoot Old Pecos Trail from downtown southeast to I-25, and St. Michaels Drive and Rodeo Road and its offshoots, both connecting Old Pecos Trail and Cerrillos east to west.  Most outlying attractions are accessible via one of these roads.  The downtown area is a remarkable warren of small roads that you really dont want to drive on; park your car and walk.  Streets there tend to wander (Paseo de Peralta, one of the main roads in the downtown area, almost completes a loop) and, even when apparently rectilinear, are not necessarily aligned to true north/south/east/west. Take extra care for pedestrians and cyclists, many streets have sharp turns.  If youre bound for the Santa Fe Opera from Albuquerque or points south, consider taking the Santa Fe Relief Route (NM SR 599), which leaves I-25 south of the Cerrillos Road exit, bypasses most of Santa Fe, and meets US 84/285 just south of the Opera.  This can be a good way of getting to lodging and restaurants on the north side of town (e.g. Gabriels, cited below) as well; although its a few miles out of the way, the much less chaotic driving, particularly around rush hour, provides considerable compensation.  Once you get to Santa Fe, consider taking a tour of downtown.  Several companies offer open-air tram tours, like  Loretto Line Tours  (available in the parking lot of the Loretto Chapel).  These tours last about 1.5 hours and give you a sense of the architecture, culture and history of the downtown area.</field>

Note that parking on any city street is illegal from 2am to 5am every day of the week.  You can usually call the Appleton Police Department and ask to get approval to be parked overnight, but during the fall and winter months it is not uncommon to be denied due to leaf collection or snow removal, so dont depend on this option.

		<field name="content">Luckily for travelers, Springfield is one of the Northeasts most walkable cities. Most of its historic sites, points of interest, and entertainment venues are clustered in the Metro Center neighborhood (aka downtown, where the skyscrapers are.) Thanks to Springfields recent economic and cultural resurgence, tourist sites are well marked, as are many architecturally significant buildings. The Basketball Hall of Fame and Forest Park - both of which are well worth visiting - are Springfields only major tourist sites outside of Metro Center; however, the Basketball Hall of Fame is within walking distance (its less than a mile south of Metro Center, along the Connecticut River.)  If youd like to explore Springfield beyond Metro Center - perhaps experience Frederick Law Olmsteds Forest Park, his largest work next to NYCs Central Park - or further explore the artsy Pioneer Valley (maybe check out bohemian Northampton or Amherst, one of Americas best-known university towns,) the clean, green, and reliable Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA)    offers service to every Springfield neighborhood, and throughout the Pioneer Valleys cities and towns north to Amherst. For a mere $1.35 ($3.00 for an all day pass) on the PVTA, you can ride the 15 miles from Springfield to the counter-culture mecca of Northampton, or the 18 miles to student-centric Amherst, and vice versa. The PVTA is a cheap and an easy way to experience this compact and diverse region. Many of the routes that do not serve major points do not run after 7pm-8pm. Meanwhile service on weekends is limited, especially on Sundays, when intervals between buses can be up to 2 hours. You should be aware of the schedule of whatever bus route your using.   Many use the PVTA or taxis to get to Springfields attractions directly across the Connecticut River, like Six Flags New England and New Englands State Fair, The Big E, Stanley Park, Holyoke Mall.  NOTE: Several years ago, walking through Springfield was considerably more hazardous than today. In the 1990s and early 2000s, crime was high in Springfield - however, the citys crime rate has fallen dramatically, to 51st last year from a high of 18th in 2003. Crime has fallen 50% in less than 8 years. However one should be aware of where they are at all times, avoid walking around certain neighborhoods (Bay-McKnight, Mason Square, certain parts of the North and South End) late at night if possible.</field>

		<field name="content">Emerald Isle does not offer public transportation options; however, taxi companies do operate on the island.    The main road through Bogue Banks is NC-58; the majority of businesses and accomodations are located on or accesible via NC-58.  This road runs the entire length of the island, from Emerald Isle to Atlantic Beach.  Although only 26 miles long, the speed limit on the road varies between 35 mph and 45 mph, so it can take up to 45 minutes to travel the length of the island.    New bike paths were installed throughout 2006 and into 2007. Covers along Emerald Drive and down Coast Guard Road. Great for walking or biking! Bikes can be rented through any of several local agencies! Also great for walking or biking is along Ocean Drive. This is the first road back from the beach, running parallel to the beach. Very small road, 25 MPH. Very little traffic! For the most part, only walkers or bikers can travel this road continuously, as there are dead-ends occasionally with bike trails across. Walk the beach to and from your daily excursions!</field>

		<field name="content">The town and nearby beach can be seen on foot, but a car is needed to explore the coastline. Street parking is generally free for a couple of hours at a time. There is also a garage at Carmel Plaza (Ocean and Junipero). Many hotels offer parking spots to guests, but be prepared for a tight squeeze. Scenic Drive sometimes yields surprisingly convenient (and free) parking spaces.  Bicycling is an option but should be undertaken with care, as many of Carmels streets can be hilly or windy, or leave little room to pass.  There are a few  local buses , but routes run primarily between Carmel and Monterey, rather than around Carmel.</field>

		<field name="content">UTA operates a bus system throughout parts of Provo and Orem, but service in the rest of Utah County is sparse when compared to Salt Lake County. New cycling paths are being built throughout the city. Cars are the main method of transportation. Parking is generally easy to find except on the Brigham Young University campus (although permit parking generally opens up to the public in the evenings).   Car rentals are available at the Salt Lake City airport and in various places in Provo. Several car rental agencies are listed here.   Enterprise Rent-a-Car , 485 S University Ave, +1 801 377-7100. M-F 7:30AM-6PM, Sa 9AM-noon.   Avis Rent-a-Car , 1200 Towne Centre Blvd (inside Sears Auto Center in the Provo Towne Centre), +1 801 494-1529. M-F 8AM-6PM, Sa 8AM-2PM, Su 12PM-4PM.   Hertz Car Rental , 101 West 100 North (Provo Marriott), +1 801 404-0931. M-F 8AM-4PM.  The majority of Provos streets follow a grid layout. Beware that the city limits between Provo and Orem are often unmarked and unclear. When following directions and finding addresses, take care that you are in the correct city. Many newer road signs indicate the city next to the street address. Also, be advised that there are two major streets named "University": University Avenue, which runs through Provo from north to south, and University Parkway (often called simply "Parkway" or the "Diagonal") which runs through both Provo and Orem.</field>

Kilgores historic (and recently revitalized) downtown area is easily accessed from Kilgore Street, one of the citys major east-west streets. The side streets can tend to be on the rough side, typical for a small East Texas town, but all are passable in essentially any automobile.</field>

Take the time to plan a route off of the main highways and see the country. Otherwise, if you require public transportation, Kansas may not a place for you.  Even the larger cities, like Wichita, Topeka, and Kansas City, offer very limited public transportation.  Intercity bus transportation in western Kansas is provided by Bee Line Express (which is part of Prestige Bus Lines).  Keep in mind that these buses do not have frquent departures.</field>

		<field name="content">The geography of city of Fremont and its street system is defined by the bay to the west and the hills to the east.  Mission Blvd runs along the hills and most streets more or less perpendicular to it have address numbers increasing as you move away from Mission Blvd. Most streets running more or less parallel to the hills have address numbers in the five digits in Fremont, increasing as you move further south (e.g., 40000 is near Stevenson Blvd and represents roughly the 400th block from Lake Merritt, Oakland).  Locals call streets running parallel to the hills north-south streets, although they are more like northwest-southeast.  Fremont Blvd is the main street running more of less parallel to the hills, cutting straight through the middle of the city of Fremont, making a turn at Irvington.  In the middle part of city of Fremont, the major streets are on a grid, with Fremont Blvd and Blacow Rd one mile apart.  Perpendicular to them, Central Ave, Mowry Ave, and Stevenson Blvd are also one mile apart, on the bay side of Fremont Blvd.</field>

Seawall Blvd. is one of the busiest parts of Galveston, especially during the summer.  Since Galveston streets are in a grid it is easy to find a less-busy parallel street to travel on, but watch out for unexpected one-way streets.  Metered street parking is available throughout the city, so bring change. The city operates a replica streetcar service, which operates in the historic district and parts of Seawall Blvd.  Pedal cars are also available to rent from various vendors for use along the Seawall and the Strand. Island Transit offers limited bus service for the city.  Get taxi information or order a cab online    or call Yellow Cab company of Galveston 409-763-3333</field>

		<field name="content">St. Cloud is laid out with its primary traffic artery (Division Street) running roughly E-W.  Crossing arteries (roughly N-S) are called "Avenues," and are numbered as either "South" or "North" of Division Street.  For example, a location "nmm 6th Ave S" would be expected to be located in the nth block south of Division street, on a N-S crossing street roughly six streets from the (Mississippi) river.  Arteries roughly parallel to Division are called "Streets," and designated either "North" or "South."  For example, a location "nmm 10th Street S" would be expected to be located on the n-hundred block west of the river, on an E-W street roughly 10 block-lengths south of Division.  The word "roughly" is definitely applicable in the above.  A similar scheme applies east of the river, but the directional system is more complex.</field>

North/south streets are divided by College St (ex: Pleasant St. is divided into North/South Pleasant by College St. There are many scenic biking trails on Oberlins periphery that converge on Tappan Square in downtown Oberlin.  Downtown Oberlin is located at the corner of Main and College. The central square, Tappan Square, is located across College St. from downtown and is a square block with corners at Main/College Sts., Main/Lorain Sts., N Professor/Lorain Sts., and Professor/College Sts. The Oberlin College campus is located just west of Tappan Square (the Student Union building, Wilder Hall, is located at 127 W. Lorain St).</field>

Some residential areas allow parking for only a limited time for non-residents, so the wise traveler is best-advised to use public transit of some kind.  The distinctive lime green B shuttle</field>

Taxi  Neils Cab (906-482-5515) operates a few taxis in the area and the City of Houghton operates a shuttle service   .  Another taxi service is Copper Country Limo, featuring airport and local transportation. This is a smoke free service. They do local and long distance with a strectch limo also available. Serving the University and Airport. (906-370-4761 or www.coppercountrylimo.com)     Car  For exploring the area, a personal car would be best.  Car rentals area available at the airport.    The road names can be confusing as the same road can have different names in different areas.  Coming into Houghton, US-41 is called College Ave after Michigan Tech, and then changes to one-way Shelden Ave in downtown Houghton, crosses the bridge, and splits into two different directions of M-26 and US-41. The Yooper Loop is a rather challenging piece of road on the south side of the lift bridge, where Memorial (US-41), Montezuma, and Shelden meet.  Go slow, but dont stop and remember to check your blind spot if you need to go onto M-26.</field>

One of the better ways to get around Coronado is by bicycle; bike paths and quiet streets (along with beautiful weather) make biking easy. A number of bicycle/pedestrian trails straddle the coastline.  The MTS runs a small circulator bus line,  Route 904 , from the ferry landing down past Hotel del Coronado. If youre not up to walking its an option, but it does not run very often.</field>

If coming from Cleveland, the 26 bus runs relatively frequently down Detroit Avenue and takes about 45 minutes between downtown Lakewood and downtown Cleveland.  Driving in and around Lakewood is fairly easy as well.  Please note that the speed limits are 20 in school zones and 25 on most other streets, and are vigorously enforced.  Parking is limited in and near the downtown area, though paid garages and metered parking are available almost everywhere.</field>

		<field name="content">Travel around Virginia is primarily(like the rest of the US) by car but public transportation is also relatively abundant in the Northern Virginia suburbs neighbouring Washington DC.  Amtrak trains run from Norfolk/Newport News to Richmond and out to the western panhandle.  Trains also run north and south between Richmond and the Northern Virginia/DC area.  A third major line runs from the western panhandle, north through Charlottesville, and up to Northern Virginia.  Virginia Railway Express (VRE), a commuter rail line, serves Washington, DC from points as far a way as Fredericksburg and Manassas.  The Washington Metro has several rail stations in Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax County.  Hitchhiking is slow-going in Virginia. Rides are hard to come by and the Virginia State Police are notorious for hassling travelers (hitchers and motorists alike). Your best bet is either to stick to the state roads in the mountains, or to stick to rest stops on the major highways.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Canandaigua is a remarkably simple city to get around.  The street grid is angled off north-south a bit, with the main drag, Route 332, heading NNW from the lake shore toward  Farmington .  The citys historic downtown retail strip is along the very wide 332, with secondary roads branching off.  Theres plenty of parking right on Main Street.  Routes 5 and 20 intersect 332 a short distance north of the lake, leading to a more modern commercial strip to the east; thats where the major big-box retailers and strip malls are.  Running right along the lake shore (and where you end up if you take Main Street past 5 and 20) is, appropriately enough, Lake Shore Drive; its a scenic boulevard that provides access to lakefront attractions.  Almost everything you need, as a traveler, will be within a short distance of these three roads.  If you need to rent a car, Enterprise (on Route 332) and Hertz (at the Airport) have locations just outside the city.</field>

Marquette has several bike paths   , one of which runs alongside the lake from Presque Isle Park    to the intersection of M-28 and US-41. Biking on M-28 or the backroads around town is rather pleasant and the traffic isnt too harsh.

A bike can work, but getting out of town there are lots of hills and the weather can change really quickly.  You will need AC in the summer.  In the winter, there is usually snow on the ground and probably ice as well.  Having snow tires is the best, but chains are always a good thing to have in the mountains, and a lot of the time you need them to cross Snoqualmie Pass.</field>

		<field name="content">Kentucky maintains 9 parkways to supplement the Interstate and U.S. Highways. These roads were all built as toll roads but have since become freeways, although the portions of these roads that will become part of the new I-66 and I-69 may become tolled again in the future. Nine roads make up the parkway system:  The Audubon Parkway, the shortest road in the system, connects  Henderson  and  Owensboro .  The Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway runs from I-65 on the north side of  Elizabethtown  to Versailles, just west of Lexington.  The Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway runs along the southern tier of the state from I-65 east of Bowling Green to Somerset, near the Lake Cumberland resort region. It has been designated as part of the future I-66.  The Hal Rogers Parkway (often called "the Rogers"; formerly the Daniel Boone Parkway), mainly a two-lane road with frequent passing lanes for heavy trucks, connects London with Hazard in the eastern third of the state. The future I-66 will parallel this road, although on a mostly new route.  The Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway connects I-64 in Winchester to eastern Kentucky near Prestonsburg. Note that the eastern half of this road, past Campton, is two lanes.  The William H. Natcher Parkway (often called "the Natcher"; formerly the Green River Parkway) connects  Owensboro  with  Bowling Green . The southern half of the highway (Bowling Green to the Western Kentucky Parkway) has also been designated as part of the future I-66.  The Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway runs from Henderson to Hopkinsville. The section from Henderson to the Western Kentucky Parkway has been designated as part of the future I-69.  The Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway runs diagonally through the Jackson Purchase (the region west of the Tennessee River), starting at the Tennessee state line in Fulton and ending at I-24 at Calvert City near Kentucky Lake. It will also be part of the future I-69.  The Wendell Ford Western Kentucky Parkway (also known as "the WK", from its former signs), is unofficially the longest road in the system, though no longer officially so. Until late October 2011, the WK ran from I-65 on the south side of Elizabethtown to I-24 near Eddyville and Lake Barkley. At that time, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, after receiving federal permission to do so, re-signed the portion from Eddyville to the Pennyrile Parkway as I-69. This segment, plus the segment from the Pennyrile to the Natcher, will be part of I-66.  Kentucky also has more than 9000 numbered state routes; most are just a dozen miles long or so. Notable ones for traversing the state include:  KY 80 crosses the southern part of the state, linking Mayfield, Hopkinsville, Bowling Green, Somerset, London, Hazard and Pikeville.  KY 70 runs west to east across the central part of the state.  Begins in Smithland, on the Ohio River, and ends at US 150 near Mt. Vernon.  The section between Morgantown and Cave City is very scenic and passes through Mammoth Cave National Park.</field>

Automobile traffic is the most common, as sidewalks and bike lanes are not as common as in the average town. Also, several people use golf carts, 4-wheelers, and off-road motorbikes, as the nearby desert is an off-road motor sports haven.</field>

Fall 2011 the city of Asbury Park numbered most of the downtown parking spots, so you need to pay up.  This link is helpful. http://cityofasburypark.com/pdfs/parking_map.pdf.    During the summer months there are three lots near the beach that have an attendant - pay them the rate $5 or $10 to avoid feeding the meter.   Off season these lots are usual free, so avoid the spaces.   If you are visiting Asbury Park for First Saturday   or a special event, trolley service is often provided at no cost. The trolley schedule and stops may vary depending on the event.   Taxi service is also available at the train station and by calling ahead.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Basic road map of Portland; click to enlarge   Downtown Portland map  Portland is an easy city to bike, walk or use public transport. However there are topographical features that affect how streets and roads flow, so planning and maps are important for any journey of more than a few blocks. The verdant West Hills slope up from downtown and divide it from the suburbs of Beaverton, Hillsboro and others.   Much of Portland is a grid, and fairly easy to navigate. Portland is divided into five sectors, sometimes referred to oxymoronically as the "five quadrants". These quadrants are roughly divided by Burnside Street between north/south and the Willamette River between east/west, with a fifth sector (North) between the Willamette River and Williams Avenue. If you hear Portlanders talking about Southwest or Northeast, theyre probably talking about a sector of the town rather than Arizona or Massachusetts.   SW - South of Burnside and west of the Willamette River, this sector includes the downtown core.  SE - South of Burnside and east of the Willamette River.  NE - North of Burnside and east of Williams Avenue.  N - North of Burnside, east of the Willamette River and west of Williams Avenue.  NW - North of Burnside and west of the Willamette River, this sector is immediately north of downtown and includes the Pearl District, Old Town, and the Northwest district.  All Portland addresses contain their designating sector inserted between house number and street name (i.e. 3719 SE Hawthorne Blvd.) The house address numbers increase 100 per block starting from Burnside Street or the Willamette River. This should make it easier to figure out where things are. In general, East/West streets are named while North/South avenues are numbered. An exception is North Portland where North/South avenues are also named. On the West side, some streets and arterial roads follow a North/South grid, others follow the topography and curve a great deal. There are major arterials that cross town in NE/SW or NW/SE orientation including Sandy Boulevard, and Foster Road on the East side, and Barbur Blvd on the SW. The streets of inner Northwest Portland are arranged alphabetically starting with Ankeny, Burnside, followed by Couch, then Davis, etc. through NW Vaughn Street making directions easy to follow here.  Driving around downtown is not recommended: inconvenient, expensive and hard-to-find parking combined with active parking meter enforcement (8AM-7PM) and non-intuitive street closures, transit malls and restrictions make it frustrating--even for locals. Most people can walk from one end of downtown to the other in 15 minutes—-faster than driving at times (or bike even faster). In fact, many of the traffic lights, both downtown and inner-Portland, seem to be timed, expecting bicycle-like speeds.  Be aware that most of the the city (and everything near downtown) is along the northerly flowing Willamette River, and not the much larger Columbia which flows west. However, the airport and Portlands northern neighbor,  Vancouver, Washington  is next to the Columbia. If you confuse the two rivers, you can easily mix up your bearings. As the Willamette River can be hard to spot on a map of Oregon, many newcomers mistakenly think Portland is along the nearby Columbia.</field>

		<field name="content">Most of Champaign-Urbana is laid out on a grid, aligned with due north, making navigation not too difficult. The exception is the oldest part of downtown Champaign, which is rotated East from the main grid. (This is because Champaign first developed parallel to the railroad).  However, be aware that street addresses can be ambiguous, if not given with the city name. For example, there are four Green Streets: East and West in Champaign, and East and West in Urbana. Therefore, if you drive eastward from Champaign to Urbana along Green, you will start out on West Green, go through East Green, and then youll be back on West Green again-- but in Urbana. Other examples are the two Washington Streets, which have nothing whatever to do with each other, and the two Elm Streets, one of which goes east-west, and the other, north-south.</field>

Average fare for either service is typically $1.75 ($2.25 for the peak times of 6:00-9:00 am and 3:00-6:30 pm.) The fare buys the rider a pass that can be used to ride on or transfer to any Metro Transit bus or train for 150 minutes.  The Duluth Transit authority offers bus and trolley service to the Twin Ports area.  The relatively new light rail service offers a visitor-friendly line that connects the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP), the Mall of America, the Warehouse District, and downtown Minneapolis among other places.  If your vehicle can run on E85, you can save money by using E85 instead of gas.  There are over 350 stations that sell E85.</field>

Another great way of getting around Emmaus is renting a car.  Easy access to Emmaus is available via PA 309/Interstate 78 exits 55, 57 and 58.  Exit 55 is PA 29 (Cedar Crest Boulevard). Southbound will take you to just west of downtown.  Exit 57 is Lehigh Street. Southbound will take you onto Chestnut Street and into downtown. It also provides access to downtown  Allentown  to the north. Exit 58 is Emaus Avenue. You are forced to go southbound anyway. This is just an easier parallel of Lehigh Street, but is only available to westbound 78 travelers.</field>

If you are biking, make sure your tires resist punctures, as all manner of plants with thorns and spines grow in the park.  The short trails to the sites along the loop road can be visited in street shoes, but hiking boots are a good idea if youre planning on visiting any of the more remote areas described under "Do."  Some but not all of the sites are wheelchair-accessible, as is one of the campsites at the park campground.</field>

Driving a car is fast, but you miss most of the scenery.  Walking is slow as molasses, but you get a whole lot of scenery.  Horseback riding, assuming you have a horse, is a great compromise.  If you dont have one, there is bicycling, also a good compromise.</field>

		<field name="content">Kihei is a sprawly place, strung out along the coast for several miles but never more than a mile wide.  The main road north-south along the ocean is South Kihei Road and it contains almost all the hotels, condos, restaurants, shops and beaches. If you are staying in the area and dont mind a bit of walking, you can probably get to most things you need without needing a car. If you do drive, the strip malls have their usual adequate free parking although individual restaurants and beaches may not.  The Piilani Highway (Highway 31), about half a mile inland, runs parallel to South Kihei Road and connects with the Mokulele Highway coming down from  Kahului . There are quite a few streets that connect the highway with South Kihei Road, so if youre looking to go anywhere other than Kihei, this is the road to take.  Note, when asking for directions, no locals will know what "Highway 31" is, they will know it as Piilani Highway.  The numbers of highways are seldom posted, and are not known by anyone on island.  Both South Kihei Road and the Piilani Highway have bike lanes, so cyclists should have a bit of space on the roads.</field>

		<field name="content">Skyline of Memphis as seen from the Hernando de Soto Bridge   Driving - Travel by car is really the only way to get around Memphis if you want to do anything other than see Downtown. Public Transit - Bus service provided by the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA)   is available across the city. Some routes are very poorly served in the evenings. At nights and weekends some buses take a different route than during the day which can be a trap for visitors. A trolley operates downtown and into Midtown, mostly for the benefit of tourists. The Bettie Bus - Airport Shuttle and local tours.     Memphis is laid out in a more or less east/west fashion. Roads primarily go east/west and north/south. The expressway cuts directly through the city.   Downtown is on the west; it sits atop the bluffs, overlooking the mighty Mississippi River. (It is referred to as Downtown, not as West Memphis, which is a town just across the river in Arkansas.) Moving east youll come to Midtown, a charming part of the city thought by some as the best part of Memphis.  Beyond that, you will find East Memphis, and then the suburbs of  Germantown ,  Collierville ,  Cordova , and  Bartlett . The area between downtown and Midtown, referred to by locals as "Crosstown," is coming to life slowly but surely. There is a movement to turn it into an artist community. Members of this movement call the area "the Edge". However, most of the "art district" is on South Main.</field>

Air travel in this region provides spectacular views of remote terrain.   The Dalton Highway runs through the Brooks Range, North Slope, and Coastal Plain to Deadhorse. This road is a great way to view these remote areas without a plane. Additionally, several roads extend outward from Barrow into surrounding areas.   Sled dogs may be used in wintery months, but the extreme cold of this region in the middle of the winter can be very treacherous.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The larger cities (Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe) have some degree of public transportation, but this is still a state where youll have to drive most of the time.  The  New Mexico Rail Runner Express  commuter train connects Albuquerque and Santa Fe, along with residential communities in the area.  Roads in New Mexico are generally well maintained and driving itself can be a pleasurable experience.  Although only a few roads are designated scenic drives, most rural highways in the western two thirds of the state provide splendid vistas.  However, if you are behind the wheel, please remain attentive to the road and the local driving habits.  New Mexico has road conditions and situations that may be different than your own; use caution and drive defensively at all times.  Speed limits on interstates are normally 75 miles per hour, except in urban and mountainous areas areas where the speed limit typically drops to 65.  Multilane US and state highways have rural speed limits ranging from 45 to 75 miles per hour. Two-lane rural highways have speed limits in the range of 45-65 miles per hour.  In urban areas and other communities speed limits can be as low as 15 and as fast as 55 miles per hour, and enforcement is more highly visible and heavy-handed than in rural areas.  A number of state highways and most county roads, remarkably enough, are still unpaved and should be driven at reduced speeds.  Between this, a number of radar traps, and the fact that many of the roads through the mountains are more sinuous than is apparent on a map, you should expect intercity travel to take a bit longer than the distance would imply, except on the Interstates.  There are exceptions in the eastern parts of the state, where youre in serious danger of being run over if you drive as slowly as the speed limits.  Weather-related driving hazards are generally confined to the winter months, when the northern half of the state, as well as the mountainous parts of the southwestern region, can experience snowstorms that close highways or render them hazardous.  Have chains or 4-wheel drive available in these areas from December through February, particularly in the mountains.  Spring winds can be disconcerting to drivers in tall vehicles and occasionally create reduced visibility from blowing dust, but dust storms are less of a problem than in some neighboring states.  Most of New Mexico is at higher elevation, hence slightly cooler, than other states of the Southwest; problems with boiling radiators, etc., are therefore not as common, although its still a good idea to take water with you when driving in the summer, particularly along the low, hot southern tier (I-10 and vicinity).  New Mexico has a severe problem with drunk driving, although aggressive enforcement and public-education campaigns have reduced DUI levels somewhat, compared to 10 years ago.  No road in the state is immune to this problem; there is no time of day when it cannot occur.  Defensive driving is the obvious antidote.  Large animals on the roadway create hazards as well. Cattle and sheep are often seen in the open range areas of the state; elk are seen in the north central mountains.  In the south, the Oryx, an elk-sized antelope imported from Africa, or the Javelina (aka the Collared Peccary), a distant relative of the pig family, are often seen on roads, especially rural routes. Again, just drive defensively.</field>

		<field name="content">The best way to navigate within Jersey City, as a tourist, is likely by PATH or light rail. Most of the major sections of town are serviced by these forms of transport. The bus system is arcane, and even locals have difficulty understanding where buses go or how often they run.  Unlike in Manhattan, taxis can be difficult to come by in Jersey City. You often have to call ahead to have one pick you up, although taxis are stationed at the Exchange Place, Grove Street and Journal Square PATH stations. Taxis in Jersey City can run either metered or unmetered (flat rate); the price is generally the same either way. If you are going unmetered, ask the price before getting into the taxi (or ask the dispatcher when you call ahead). Taxis are not cheap; a cab from Grove Street to Journal Square is about $10.  Zipcar is available in Jersey City.  Most locations are downtown, although there is also one location each for Liberty State Park and Journal Square.  Cars are within walking distance of all PATH stations in Jersey City as well as light rail stops between Newport and Liberty State Park.  Zipcar locations can also be found in neighboring Hoboken.  Generally, cars are readily available on weekdays.  Availability is not as certain on weekends, although some cars should be available if one is flexible and only needs the car for a few hours.</field>

Most businesses and tourist attractions are located either along the shores of Leech Lake or in the downtown area, only two blocks south of the shoreline.  Parking spaces are plentiful, but are often either occupied or difficult to get out of.  The main traffic artery in Walker is "Main Street", officially "Minnesota Avenue".  This is merely the portion of Highway 371 that passes through the city.  The businesses on the street form most of the downtown area.</field>

Several bus lines of CARTS (Chautauqua Area Regional Transit System) do run through Fredonia. They are not city lines, however, and are more useful for reaching some of the more rural areas of the county rather than travelling point to point in Fredonia.</field>

		<field name="content">If youre staying close to Main Street, walking is the easiest way to get around.  Because there is no taxi service, walking or riding a bicycle will provide a picturesque way of navigating around town.  But bike riders should be wary: the roads are narrow and blind curves make for a very potentially dangerous situation.  Only ride bikes in town, and avoid taking them on the highway.  Drive your own car when going outside of the city.</field>

		<field name="content">As there is no public transportation based in Crawford County and few taxis, one must rely on their own mode of transportation, usually an automobile. However, the rural nature of the county roads, lend themselves well to bicycles and motorcycles as well as walking. Hitchhiking would be frowned on by the local police and likely result in interrogation if not worse. If on a bicycle or motorcycle, keep an eye out for animals, especially dogs. Best defense = air horn/fog horn, or better yet, a good squirt from a drinking bottle.  When visiting Ohio Counties, you will find that the best road maps are usually free from County Engineers offices: Crawford County Engineer, 815 Whetstone Street,  Bucyrus , PH:419-562-7731.</field>

		<field name="content">The easiest way to access the charm of Narragansett is by foot or bike. To get the complete seasonal experience that Narragansett has to offer, you are invited to explore the picturesque beauty by walking along our wonderful beaches, or riding along our scenic waterfront roads. To help get around one might consider renting a moped/scooter or car to be able to get around from the Narragansett Pier area to Scarborough and Point Judith. You are also very welcome to visit our interesting historic sites. Whether you prefer historic lighthouses, beautiful marinas, or our striking works of art, the choice is up to you. If staying for a long visit in Narragansett, you may want to consider a beach pass for access to alternate parking because the beautiful beaches attract many people which leaves parking hard to find and expensive. Having a beach pass would guarantee parking in reserved parking lots.</field>

Should there be parking, strictly adhere to the time limits posted. Tickets are given. There are parking garages downtown and ample parking in them. Many places are accessible by foot downtown, but unless you are adventureous, plan to drive from downtown to the outlet shopping area. For those averse to walking or driving, Petaluma Transit provides intercity transport during limited hours. Cycling is another very pleasant option around town.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Once entering the island, US 278 becomes known as the William Hilton Parkway. After traveling about a mile on the island, the road splits in two.  William Hilton Parkway continues as US 278 Business, a surface road around the eastern end of the island. US 278 Business is a four-lane divided highway, but most businesses on the island are along the road, making for a slow, 25-to-30-minute drive to the southern end of the island.  US 278 itself branches off onto the Cross Island Parkway, a grade-separated expressway. The Cross Island Parkway is a toll road, costing $1.25 for most passenger cars. The parkway reduces the journey from the split to the south end of the island to five minutes. Both US 278 and US 278 Business terminate at the Sea Pines Circle at the south end of the island. From this circle, cars can continue south on Greenwood Drive to enter the gated Sea Pines plantation, or east on Pope Avenue to head towards Coligny Beach, the major public beach on the island.  Hilton Head is quite  cycling -friendly. All main roads and most major roads in the resort plantations have a companion bicycle path, and there are a few miles of paths that cut their own trail away from the roads. Although not lit for night riding, they are the perfect way to traverse the island during the day time hours. Bicycle rental stores are plentiful, although they may be expensive.   Along with the convenience of bicycle travel, however, come a few rules to be followed. The most important rule, as with most bicycle path systems, is that cars always have the right of way when crossing the street. All bicycles are expected to stop and yield to cars at all street crossings. Most crossings have bicycle-sized stop signs and painted stop lines to remind riders of this fact. Bicycles may cross only when the street is clear or a car stops and yields the right of way. Riders are also expected to ride on the right side of the paths. Some golf courses may open up their cart paths to bicycles during non-playing hours (in the morning and at night), but other than this it is generally not a good idea to stray off the paths.</field>

		<field name="content">City Bus .  As the only form of public transit serving the city, bus service may cover the areas near some sights youd want to see, but not nearly all. Routes are long and the wait for the next bus can stretch to an hour. In general, this is not a good way to get around.  Taxi Hailable only at the airport, they dont even queue at downtown hotels.  Points of interest are far enough apart that a rental car quickly becomes cost-effective.  Unlike other cities of its size, you cant even find any at the bus station.  Rental Car If you didnt drive to Wichita, youll likely want to rent a car when you arrive.   Navigating Wichita Wichita is almost exclusively a driving town.  Even so, traffic is generally lighter than most larger cities, and parking is almost always free and plentiful, even downtown. Wichitas streets are laid out in a fairly easy to navigate grid system.  No trip to Wichita is complete without an excursion through the nearby  Flint Hills , and thats only possible in a car (preferably a convertible).</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The historic center of Alexandria is known as "Old Town". This is where you find the most notable restaurant, shopping, architectural, and tourist destinations.  A good plan of action (if you are not staying in Old Town) would be to take the Metro    to King Street, then take the Free King Street Trolley    to the waterfront, then walk from there. These black and red rubber tire trolleys are free and will stop at any one of the signs for the trolley stops seen along King street.  The local "DASH"    system also operates many buses that will take you from the King Street Metro station to the historic center.   Two hour parking is often available a few blocks away from King Street (though it can be harder to find on weekend evenings), but read the parking signs carefully. Some parking is free, some is metered, and some is for locals only.  Tires are frequently marked (chalked) by parking enforcement staff; if you exceed 2 hours you WILL get a ticket. If you plan on leaving your car for more than a couple hours it would be wise to pay to park in one of the many parking garages in the city.  A water taxi runs from the waterfront at the end of King Street to both Georgetown in Washington D.C. and to National Harbor in Maryland.  You can also rent bikes in Old Town at Big Wheel Bikes located near the waterfront just south of King Street. The Mount Vernon Trail runs through Alexandria (although the Old Town section is streets) and goes all of the way to Mount Vernon, as well as connecting with the greater D.C. area.   Getting around Alexandria beyond Old Town and the Duke Street business district is a little more difficult, and will require bus transit or a car.  Taxis are available anywhere for door to door service, just call to be picked up and you can expect one within 15 minutes anywhere. Expect to pay on average about a dollar a minute for travel by taxi.</field>

Open only during the summer from late June to mid-October, there are many overlooks with interpretive signs. The only access to the lake itself is by steep trail to Cleetwood Cove, where boat tours of the lake are offered. Numerous picnic areas are along the Rim Drive, as is hiking access from Rim Village to Garfield Peak. Rim Drive also accesses Lightning Springs (west side), Cleetwood Cove (north side), Mount Scott (east side), Sun Notch Viewpoint and Crater Peak (south side). Both Kerr Notch and Sun Notch Viewpoints are particularly spectacular viewpoints, with views down to Phantom Rock and across the lake to Wizard Island.  There are many trails open to horses. But, if youre not a cowboy then hiking the trails is also a great experience. While on the trails keep an eye open for the many deer grazing in the hills.</field>

Formerly part of Main Street was closed to traffic as the pedestrian Main Mall, but this has been converted back to a driveable street.  Within the City of Poughkeepsie, Route 9 is an expressway, but outside the city it becomes South Road and North Road, commercial thoroughfares lined with strip malls and the like.  The City of Poughkeepsie has a municipal bus system operating within the city, centering on the intersection of Main and Market streets where several routes meet.

To go to or between the concourses, you take an escalator down to a long underground hallway (the Transportation Mall), and take the fast Plane Train, an automated people mover that stops at every concourse/terminal roughly every 2 minutes. You can also choose to walk (its about 1000 feet between each concourse). With either method, you dont leave and then re-enter secure zones, so tight connections are usually quite feasible.  Concourses E and F are the international terminals, with F now most often used. Its where you will go through customs and immigration when arriving from abroad. You can go to or be picked up directly at terminal F, by car, taxi or shuttle.  If you flight arrives at "F" and you want to use other ground transportation (rental car, public transit, other shuttle), take the free airport shuttle connector to the domestic terminal or car rental center.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Most people chose cars, but if headed to a central area, such as Main Street, it is best to drive there, and park in a municipal parking lot, and walk around from there. Since so much of the town’s retail area is clustered in 3 or 4 block radius, it would be beneficial to walk around, but might also be dangerous given the high traffic intersections. If walking use caution, and if parking, make sure to feed the meter with plenty of pocket change; the meter maids take their job very seriously. Since fort lee is situated in such a convenient area for those commuting to and from the city, there is often high traffic and congestion on the roads. If you are planning on being somewhere at a certain time, one might suggest leaving a good 10 to 15 minutes to escape local traffic before hitting any major roadways.  For local transportation or air-port/train station services, there are several local taxi companies that are reliable.    Babes  185 Bridge Plaza North, Fort Lee, New Jersey, tel: (201) 944-6800.

		<field name="content">If you want to travel the state, then you will need to rent a vehicle. Prices are the same as across the United States.  The state is roughly quarted by two major Interstates, the north-south running I-25 and the east-west running I-70. (I-76 also enters the state in the Northeast from  Nebraska ). Surrounding the greater Denver area is a beltway consisting of the Northwest Parkway (tollway), C-470, E-470 (tollway)]. The  Northwest Parkway  is a 75-mile per hour toll road that seamlessly connects I-25 at E-470 in the north metro Denver area, with U.S. 36 and State highway 128 in Broomfield. Outside of the Front Range, the rest of the state is traversed by small highways and county roads.  The major cities of the greater Denver area (Denver, Aurora, Boulder, Lakewood, Littleton, Longmont, Broomfield) are linked by bus and train transportation using RTD. Service south to Castle Rock and Colorado Springs is provided by FREX. The cost is very reasonable and the busses run regular schedules.  Taxis and shuttle services are also available throughout the state.</field>

For example, they give you a car with empty gas, and upon return they charge you full gas.  Also, their cars are pre-scratched under the front headlights, so if you decline insurance, they are ready to charge you for alleged "damage" to their cars.</field>

Except for some of the newer areas on the west side of town, most streets are numbered (for streets going east and west) and lettered (north-south). The use of compass directions in addresses can be initially confusing:    There are no east-west designations in addresses: streets start at the edge of the mountain to the east of town, with addresses increasing to the west.   Center Street runs east and west. Streets parallel to it have North or South as part of the street name. For instance, 700 S 9th St. would be a block west of 600 S 9th St., on a street that is 9 blocks south of Center   On lettered streets, North and South are part of the street number: For instance, 123 S G St. would be in the second block south of Center Street.</field>

Although largely true, especially taking into account the suburbs, the adventurous can manage to see a lot of attractions on foot or bicycle, and the patient can take advantage of the municipal bus system to traverse the entire county.  Of course, in winter all bets are off.  Driving becomes potentially hazardous, biking becomes impossible, and walking is very much hit-or-miss.  Rush hours in Rochester are approximately 7AMndash;8:30AM and 4:30PMndash;6PM on weekdays.</field>

This area is dense enough that you can easily walk, bike, or roller skate around the neighborhood. Plus, parking can get a little difficult to find, so once you get a spot you might not want to risk losing it.  For the areas of La Jolla outside the "village", such as around UCSD or Torrey Pines, a car will be the easiest way to get around due to the distances and hilly terrain of the surrounding area.</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around the town is a little tricky.  The roads are mostly narrow with no shoulder except for Route 209 running through most of the town.  Biking is an option but its important to watch out for cars on the back roads because often they are moving fast around 40 mph.  During the tourist season (summer) there can be high traffic on the way to the beach.   There is no real form of public transportation unless you want to bumb a ride on the bus with your six year old to Phippsburg Elementary School at 7 am.  Most people would either rent a car from an airport or use a friends car to get around if you dont live near the state.   Boating may be a good way to get around.  Most of the town is surrounded by water so most places are easily accessible by boat.</field>

		<field name="content">You need your own vehicle (car, SUV, camper, bicycle, motorcyle), unless you are sailing.    If you intend to drive on the backwoods AAA roads and abundant dirt roads, 4-wheel drive off-road vehicles are recommended, especially in spring.    In winter, be prepared to drive on snow and ice. Snow tires and four-wheel drive would be helpful, as snowfall and drifting can get quite deep. Lake-effect snowfall is frequent along the shores of Lake Superior, and at times the flurries can be quite heavy. Watch the weather forecasts, and plan your trip accordingly. Driving at night during a snow storm can be dangerous, especially because of the distance between towns with gas stations that stay open late. Be prepared to pull over and wait out storms; keeping a warm blanket in the back seat for this purpose is a very good idea. On the bright side, motels are cheap, and some of them are busier than you would expect, thanks to the snowmobile crowd.  The pre-eminent scenic east-west route in the Upper Peninsula is USnbsp;2 along the northern shore of Lake Michigan. It follows the coastline very closely for miles and there are several areas in which you can pull off and park to access the beach directly, especially close to  St. Ignace . M-28 also runs along the Lake Superior shore for long stretches, especially as you get close to  Marquette , but contains the famous "Seney Stretch", a segment of two-lane highway west of Seney, without a curve, bump in the road, or turn-off for 25nbsp;miles.  Watch for deer and the occasional moose in this area.</field>

		<field name="content">Purdue Campus   Trolley   Original Standard Oil station   The area is divided by the Wabash river. To the east of the river is Lafayette and to the west is West Lafayette. Lafayette is broken down into several neighborhoods. Starting at the river and heading East is Downtown. Here you will find numerous shops and restaurants as well as most of the museums and theaters. North of downtown is the Historical Centennial Neighborhood. South of downtown is the Ninth Street Hill Neighborhood. Most of the shopping and hotels are either Downtown or along one of the main arteries. State Rd 26 runs East and West bisecting both cities. State Rd 52 curves around the East side of town and crosses the river into the Northern side of West Lafayette. On State Rd 52 near the Southeast side of town you will find the Tippecanoe Mall. Interstate 65 marks the Eastern edge of Lafayette. From South to North there are 4 exits for Lafayette, St Rd 38, St Rd 26, St Rd 25, and St Rd 43 (for West Lafayette).  The John T. Myers Pedestrian Bridge connects downtown Lafayette with West Lafayette. Starting at the river and heading west into West Lafayette is the Levee area and Wabash Landing. This area is fairly new with several shops, a multiplex theater, park, and outdoor ice skating rink. Continue west up the hill on State Rd. 26 to the Chauncey Hill and Village area. There you will find most of the college bars and several restaurants. Continue west on Hwy. 26 to pass through the main campus of Purdue University. To the North and East of Purdue is the main residential area of West Lafayette.   Bus   , There are 15 bus routes around the cities. Tickets are $1, 10 tokens for $7.50 (you can ask for one free transfer ticket), $28 for a calendar month pass, free for students and staff at Purdue. There is a free trolley bus going from downtown Lafayette to West Lafayette/Purdue and back every 15 minutes.  Some bus lines do not run on weekends, in the summer, or anytime when classes are not in session; check schedules for details.  Lafayette and the surroundings areas are suburban and relatively spread out; a private automobile is recommended.</field>

		<field name="content">The  PATH train system  runs from Manhattan to Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark.   NJ Transit  is a commuter network of trains, light rail and buses connecting communities throughout the entire state. It can be used for travel to Newark Liberty International Airport as well as Pennsylvania Station in New York City. Its website provides a user friendly method of planning your itinerary.   SEPTA  Regional Rail Lines connect Trenton and West Trenton with Philadelphia.   PATCO  Operates a high speed train that connects several key points in downtown Philadelphia to many immediate southern New Jersey suburban towns.  There are also numerous taxi and limousine services that one can call for a pick-up, and a variety of county bus services that can take people to lesser-known spots in the state (usually suburbs, parking lots, train stations, strip malls, apartment buildings, and/or small towns, depending on the county and the route).   Private bus companies, such as Suburban Transit, Martz Trailways and DeCamp, also work New Jersey and have routes in the state.  Some traffic oddities are peculiar to New Jersey. Left turns are not permitted from many of the major divided highways in urban areas. Instead, exit ramps for left turns and U-Turns may follow intersections, providing opportunities to return to the desired intersection and make a (permitted) right turn.  Also, many signals have a delayed green light following a red, so keeping an eye on the traffic signal instead of observing oncoming traffic is essential. Traffic circles (roundabouts) are quite common as well along major highways, and exits are not always clearly marked.  Some toll bridges along the shore charge vehicles heading in one particular direction only, like toward  New York State  to the east and toward  Delaware  and  Pennsylvania  to the west.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">With careful logistical planning, it is possible to get a car onto the island, but be sure you have at least three days to waste each way.  There are 4 automobile reservations for three of the six boats and you must get them one month in advance in person at the ferry terminal when they open or by calling the ferry terminal from which you are departing no earlier than 9:30 AM.  In the summer months, the reservations are gone before the earliest time you can call for them.  Best advice: dont bother with it.  If you MUST have a car on the island, ask a terminal employee where you should put your car to get in line.  You can usually get on within 2-3 ferries of when you put your car in line.  If there arent 2-3 ferries left in the day, just sleep in you car (or you can run across the street to the  Navigator Inn  if you must), but KEEP YOUR CAR IN THE LINE.  If you leave, you lose your place in queue.  Youll get onto the first boat 90% of the time because many VH residents put their cars in line, ride the last boat home, ride the first boat back the following morning, and catch the second in their car.  This means that the first of the day is the least competitive.   Returning from the island is even more convoluted.  You must get to the ferry terminal the day before to get a line number, which is a guaranteed spot on a ferry.  The numbers are issued at 5:30 AM the day before departure and in the summer months, people will line up at 3 AM or earlier to get themselves on the boat they want.  It is more difficult to get a spot on the morning boats because the locals who are running errands use the early boats in order to return that day.  There are people who will get a line number for you for about $30 - $40 if you value a nights sleep in bed more than a nights sleep in your car at the ferry terminal.  If all this is too much, forget it all.  The island itself is only 5 miles long by 7 miles wide (in a crescent shape), with 49 miles of paved road.  This means that for any given journey, youll never need to go more than 5 miles (or thereabouts).  Despite the way the locals seem to drive, walking on the roads is a safe means of transportation.  You can also rent some pretty disreputable bikes from the Tidewater (free if youre staying there, $10/day otherwise).  But by and large, youll have no trouble hoofing it wherever you need.  Additionally, most of the tourist-catering business folk are perfectly happy to pick you up wherever you are and bring you to their services (and the nice ones will take you back or drop you off wherever you need).</field>

		<field name="content">Cupertino has 2 major streets: De Anza Blvd., which runs North-South, and Stevens Creek Blvd., which runs East-West. The intersection of these two streets is in the center of Cupertino, and most of the businesses and shopping centers in the city are located in the area.  Highways 85 and 280 cross through Cupertino. These provide excellent access to the western cities in the  South Bay , and to downtown San Jose (respectively).  Public transportation in Cupertino, as is the case for much of Silicon Valley, is very poor due to the low population density and demographics of the region.  Traffic is not much of an issue and major streets come with bike lanes, so biking is relatively safe.</field>

		<field name="content">In recent years, Killeen has become increasingly easy to get around without a car, thanks to the municipal bus service provided by "The HOP."  HOP stops are located throughout the city, some of which are only a few blocks apart.  To find out the HOP schedule from a particular stop, call (254) 616-6800.  The buses usually stop running before it gets dark.  With a car, Killeen can be difficult to navigate, due to the irregular street pattern that exists outside of downtown.  A map of the city (which can be purchased at Wal-Mart or at local convenience stores) can be very helpful.</field>

		<field name="content">There are four main areas of the park: Morefield Campground, Far View, Chapin Mesa, and Wetherill Mesa. Morefield Campground is just inside the park, 4 miles from the entrance. Another 11 miles in is Far View, where you can drive another 6 miles to Chapin Mesa or turn right and drive 12 miles to get to Wetherill Mesa.  For the most part you will need private transportation in order to move throughout the park. The only public transit available is on Wetherill Mesa, where a tram services the area that is otherwise inaccessible to automobiles. The roads are steep, narrow, and winding, so make sure your car is in good shape and has plenty of gas. You can get gasoline at the Morefield Campground store. Watch out for rocks that may have fallen on to the road.  Trailers and towed vehicles are not permitted beyond Morefield Campground. If youre not camping, you can park these vehicles in the parking lot located near the entrance station. The road to Wetherill Mesa (open Memorial Day to Labor Day) has sharp curves and steep grades, so vehicles on this road are restricted to less than 8,000 pounds and 25-feet in length.</field>

		<field name="content">US Highway 101 is a freeway virtually its entire length. It connects San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Oxnard with Los Angeles. The Monterey Peninsula is a few miles to the west. Outside of the Monterey Peninsula there are few towns of any size off 101; Lompoc in Santa Barbara County is one.  The rail route essentially follows 101, which was built along the rail corridor. There is only one train a day – the often unreliable Coast Starlight – that covers the whole corridor. The Pacific Surfliners to Los Angeles and San Diego go as far north as Paso Robles in northern San Luis Obispo County, there is more service from Santa Barbara south. Amtrak Thruway buses cover gaps in train service.   Greyhound serves Santa Cruz, Salinas, King City, Paso Robles, Atascadero, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and Oxnard (but not Ventura), connecting to San Francisco and Los Angeles.  There are commercial airports near Monterey, San Luis Obispo, and (the largest) Santa Barbara, there are no flights within the Central Coast, only flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles.</field>

The main east-west streets of central Hollywood are Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Blvd, intersected by the main north-south streets of La Brea Ave, Highland Ave, Cahuenga Blvd, Vine St, and Gower St. Any location within a few blocks of these intersections is likely to be a satisfying choice. Night-time pedestrian activity in this area is focused on Hollywood Blvd.  Hollywood Boulevard is served frequently by Metro Bus Lines 180, 181, 217 and Metro Rapid 780.  Three Metro Red Line Stations are on Hollywood Blvd, at Western, Vine and Highland.  Sunset Boulevard is served frequently by Metro Bus Lines 2 and 302.  Vine Street is served frequently by Metro Bus Line 210, and La Brea Avenue is served frequently by Metro Bus Lines 212 and 312.  The main areas of Hollywood are walkable, and you could walk all the way from Hollywood Blvd to Melrose, but most people would probably drive.</field>

It is a peak-bagging trail, so consider yourself warned, it will occasionally be a strenuous hike.  There are lots of good trails throughout the mountains that can be found using a good hiking guide or by getting information from the ranger stations, or by visiting the  Green Mountain Club .  The  Appalachian Trail  coincides with the Long Trail through the southern half of the forest and splits off in Gifford State Park, at the southern end of the northern half of the forest.  There are lots of drivable park roads (though they are usually dirt or gravel roads) throughout the park.  They are identified by small brown signs with the road number on them.</field>

The road is open 6AM-8:30PM in the summer (May - Sep) and 8AM-4:30PM in the winter (Oct - Apr).    The loop is not paved and can be quite rough and dusty, but most vehicles should be able to manage.  You are not permitted to deviate from the loop drive without a native guide present.  The loop drive can be done in as little as 30-40 minutes, but most visitors will take several hours to enjoy the scenery.  There is no shortage of native guides eager to take you (for a fee, of course!) to the restricted areas.</field>

		<field name="content">The best way to get around downtown is on foot or by bicycle, but please do not bike on the sidewalk.  Where available, such as on Delaware Avenue, use dedicated bike lanes.    Motorists will find ample spaces to park on-street or in lots operated by the Newark Parking Authority.  Just be sure to feed the meter when parking your car on the street, because the meters run all night. The downtown lots have free parking on Sunday mornings, and throughout the week you can get parking validation from most local businesses.  A free bus, called the Unicity, is operated jointly by the city and the University of Delaware to shuttle people around town Monday through Friday.  Take the James F. Hall Bike Trail to cut through town the scenic way. Starting in College Square Shopping Center, and ending just off of Elkton Road, the trail roughly follows the Amtrak tracks that run parallel to Main Street.  In the evenings, Bike Line offers a bicycle pedi-cab service that runs all over Newark. All rides are free, but please tip your driver.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The city streets have a grid system thats helpful if you learn it.  Minneapolis is divided into quadrants: North, South, Northeast and Southeast.  Hennepin Avenue forms the divider between streets labeled N and S near downtown.  This division continues through the smaller portion of Minneapolis east of the Mississippi, dividing it into Northeast (NE) and Southeast (SE).  Further west of downtown, this division lies along Linden Avenue, just north of the I-394 freeway. In North, Northeast and Southeast Minneapolis, all roads carry N, NE, or SE prefixes on street signs.  In South Minneapolis, the north-south avenues are marked S.  The east-west streets are marked with W or E, depending if you are west or east of Nicollet Avenue.  Even though street signs show these directions before the names, most locals read the addresses with them at the end.  Thus "York Avenue South" appears on signs as "S York Ave" and "N 33rd Ave" is pronounced "33rd Avenue North".  Minneapolis is one of few cities to use multi-colored street signs.  The colors indicate the priority of plowing during winter storms. Although plowing has since changed, they still indicate what sort of street. Blue signs indicate major roads which are "Snow Emergency Routes". These are still the first to be plowed. Rust-colored signs indicate roads that run primarily east-west. Light green signs indicate roads primarily north-south. Dark green signs indicate scenic parkways that ring the city and the lakes.</field>

		<field name="content">Many of Worcesters points of interest are far spaced from one another. The only practical way to get around is by car (or bike). Public transit in Worcester is focused mainly on commuters. Cabs are no longer inexpensive, and are often more expensive per mile than cabs in other cities. If youre there for more than just a visit, bicycles are available from many used stores and are the best way to get around and explore. Buses in the city usually run every 30 to 60 minutes, with some running only every two hours depending on the route. Fare is $1.50 or $3.50 for an all-day pass. Buses on certain routes are often a half hour or more late, but be at your stop early as they often fly by a few minutes early in order to catch up for previous late stops.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Driving in Middletown is easy for locals, but can be a bit confusing for out-of-towners.  The city only has one freeway ramp, exit 32, which is state route 122.  State route 122 is known as Roosevelt Blvd, which is part of the Martin Luther King beltway.  Major east-west roads are Oxford State in the south end, which connects Middletown with Trenton as state route 73, 14th street, part of the Martin Luther King beltway, Central Avenue, which is the main downtown corridor (and curiously changes to coles road at the Warren County line), Manchester Avenue (One of 3 Manchesters in Middletown), and Verity Parkway, part of state route 73.  North-South routes are Cincinnati-Dayton Road (another with multiple names, Dixie Highway and Old 25), Breiel Boulevard, which is a very heavily traveled route, University Boulevard (part of Martin Luther King beltway), Verity Parkway, and Main Street. The street system, while it may seem odd, has its advantages.  Most streets, even residential are far wider than necessary, and one can get anywhere in the city in fifteen minutes.  Rush hour traffic usually means waiting an extra light cycle for the arrow.  Red light cameras are EVERYWHERE, so........dont run red lights!</field>

		<field name="content">US 62 parallels the Western Kentucky Pkwy through Ohio County (as well as the rest of Kentucky) from east to west. It connects the Hartford-Beaver Dam area with the town of Rosine and further east to Horse Branch and beyond to Grayson County. To the west, US 62 passes McHenry and Rockport before crossing the Green River into Muhlenberg County.  US 231 parallels the Natcher Pkwy in Ohio County (and the entire length of the parkway) from north to south. From the south, it enters from Butler County and passes Cromwell before entering Beaver Dam (where it provides access to the Western Kentucky Pkwy at Exit 75). US 231 connects Beaver Dam with Hartford as a four-lane thoroughfare with shops and restaurants, along with Ohio County High School. To the north US 231 passes near Beda and Pleasant Ridge before entering Daviess County.  KY 69 Links Hartford with the northeastern community of Fordsville before heading toward the Ohio River at Hawesville. From Fordsville KY 54 West connects with Whitesville and Owensboro, while KY 54 East connects with Leitchfield. There is an interchange at the Natcher Pkwy with KY 69, providing Hartford with easy access to Owensboro and Bowling Green. KY 69 continues west to Centertown.  KY 505 links Rosine with US 231 near Cromwell to the south and KY 878 in Olaton to the north. There is no interchange with the Western Kentucky Pkwy south of Rosine.</field>

		<field name="content">Most people in Suffolk County get around by car. For short trips, there are generally taxis that wait for arriving trains at LIRR stations but may otherwise need to be called; dont expect to hail taxis on the streets. There is a network of  Suffolk County buses , but they are often slow and in many cases run infrequently, so depending on the route and time of arrival and departure, it may be impractical to depend on them as part of a day trip. In order to access some islands off the shore of Long Island, such as  Fire Island , a ferry may be convenient or even required.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Unless you want to spend a lot of time waiting for buses, a car is a must to fully experience Jacksonville; due to Jacksonvilles size and low density, most destinations are not within walking distance of each other.  Mass transit is limited to the city bus system, and an elevated rail system in the downtown district that links both banks of the river with a crossing on the Acosta Bridge.  The bus system is minimally adequate; no bus runs past midnight, and many bus routes stop running at around 8 or 9PM.  All buses are linked via GPS to a central control system and stops are well-marked throughout the entire city.    Jacksonville Transportation Authority, Phone: (904) 630-3100,   . The bus system is fairly extensive in scope, but you must plan ahead as the frequency of stops is between 30 minutes to an hour.  Buses are air-conditioned and reasonably comfortable, but JTA buses struggle with on-time performance.  Taxi services are available, but expensive due to the sprawl of the city.  Car rentals are the most convenient for of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times.  Car Rental Companies include: Alamo Rent A Car, Toll free: 1-800-462-5266,   . Avis Rent A Car, Toll free: 1-800-331-1212,   . Budget Rent A Car, Toll free: 1-800-527-0700,   .

Hertz Car Rental, Toll free: 1-800-654-3131,   . Thrifty, Toll free: 1-800-847-4389,   . It is also possible to bike around the historic neighborhoods of Riverside, Avondale, Murray Hill, and San Marco. Starting in Riverside, you can walk or bike down the Riverwalk to the Main St. Bridge, located in downtown. Ride or walk over the bridge to access San Marco and its many shops and restaurants. Biking is a great way to enjoy the urban cores varied and beautiful architecture which is so easy to miss by car.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">Interior of the Minneapolis Skyway  Although most of the citys grid is along a strict north-south/east-west layout, the area near downtown on both sides of the river lies at an angle to the rest of the citys grid to better align with the river.  Here streets run parallel to the river, and avenues run perpendicular (except for Washington Avenue, which parallels the river).  Downtown contains mostly numbered streets and avenues, although a few important ones are named.  Most of Downtown is within South Minneapolis, although the Warehouse District extends into North Minneapolis.  Keep in mind that this is the only part of town, other than the West Bank, where you will encounter streets as well avenues designated "South".  The intersection of S 2nd Ave and S 5th St is many blocks from the intersection of S 2nd St and S 5th Ave!  Much of downtown uses a series of  Skyways  to connect downtown shops and businesses. Navigating the skyway system can be confusing since one often has to take a curcuitous route to reach their destination. However, its often a welcome alternative to walking outside in Minneapolis harsh winter cold.  For example, one could walk from the Convention Center in Minneapolis to Washington Avenue (a block before the Mississippi) without going outside, and without stopping at a pedestrian traffic light. Interstate 394 feeds into heated parking garages, so that a Wayzatan suburbanite could enter her vehicle, drive the length of 394 to the heated lot, go to work, shop at Target or Neiman-Marcus, see a movie, have dinner, and return home - all without having to wear a coat or change clothes, even in 20-below weather.   If you get tired of walking, Metro Transit buses are only $0.50 per ride within the Downtown Zone; keep in mind that no transfers are issued when paying the downtown fare. You can also ride a light-rail train between Target Field and Downtown East/Metrodome stations for this same fare. In addition, certain buses on the Nicollet Mall are marked "Free Ride"; specifically, they are the northbound Route 18 and southbound Route 10 buses. You can board these buses without paying a fare.</field>

It also receives service from five cargo operators: Everts Air Cargo, Northern Air Cargo, Alaska Central Express, Arctic Transportation Services, and Lynden Air Cargo, and numerous small air taxi services including Renfros Alaskan Adventures. The airport ranks third in the state for total number of flights. It offers a 6,400 foot asphalt runway and 1,850 foot gravel crosswind runway, and is currently undergoing a $7 million renovation and expansion. Three float plane bases are nearby: Hangar Lake, H Marker Lake, and the Kuskokwim River. See the Go next section for more details.  By Taxi  Bethel has more cabs per capita than any other city in the United States.  Due to the dependance of many residents and visitors on cabs, and the high cost of transportation, cab fee maximums are mandated by the City of Bethel, corresponding roughly to the distance of the trip.  Rides within the central area of town are $5, to or from the Tundra Ridge subdivision are $7, to or from the Airport is $7, and trips to the Kasayuli Subdivision are $10.  Something important for visitors to Bethel to know is that cab rides in Bethel are often a "communal" experience.  While riding in a cab from the airport into the main part of town, for example, the cab driver may get a call to pick up another fare in Blueberry Subdivision.  While potentially uncomfortable for the shy traveler (or if the cab gets too crowded), this is actually a great way to meet people in Bethel.  These are numbers for the taxi services in Bethel                 By Public Transit  A more recent addition to Bethels transportation options is the city bus.  At $2 a ride for adults, many Bethel residents are finding the bus to be a more economical transportation option than cabs when time is not an issue.  Routes have been expanded recently to include most of the town, and a slightly out-of-date route map and schedule can be found here.    By Car  Those visiting for an extended period of time or moving to Bethel may be considering renting or buying a car.  As is true with most everything in Bethel, prices are substantially higher than one would expect, both to purchase (or ship in), own, and maintain a car in the rural setting, but many people feel it is worth it for convenience and independence.  Gas prices are high, but do not fluctuate daily as in other places.  Cost is set by the retailers when new supplies are barged in through the brief summer months, meaning the price of gas will only change a couple times a year.  Currently, gas stations and their respective prices are:</field>

A car is worth having for visits to the North Shore or if you are staying outside of Honolulu/Waikiki.  The Oahu bus system, officially called  TheBus , runs between almost all towns and to most tourist destinations. Fare for TheBus is $2.50; exact change is compulsory and it will get you anywhere on the island TheBus goes.    400px   There is a 4 day TheBus Tourist pass available from most ABC Stores (like a 7/11) for $25. Make sure you scratch it correctly before getting on the first TheBus.  Also available from ABC Stores and other Waikiki-area shops is a very handy guide to TheBus for $2.95.  The tram-style "Free Shopping Shuttles" which pick up around Waikiki beach will take you to the Ala Moana Center. Be aware that this shuttle will first take you to Hilo Hatties flagship tourist shop west of the center. Its free, but not a direct route so if youre not interested in stopping off at Hilo Hatties you may prefer to look elsewhere for transport as this option will add at least 30 minutes to your commute.</field>

It was recently named No. 1 for tourist congestion, beating out the popular Cape Cod.  Greyhound no longer serves the coast, but many towns are serviced by local bus lines such as Porter Stage Coach.</field>

		<field name="content">Transit in Los Gatos is largely automobile-based, along with a significant amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic. However, if you do not wish to drive, walk, or ride a bicycle, then there is really only one alternative, and that is VTA (Valley Transportation Authority). This organization runs all public transit for the Santa Clara valley area, hence the name. The VTA operates many bus lines along with three light rail train lines, but, if your intent is only to get around Los Gatos, then the buses are all you need to think about. There are two lines that serve Los Gatos, line 48 and line 49. Both serve the same general loop around the town, in opposite directions, and both convene at the Winchester Transit Center/Light Rail station in nearby Campbell. Fares vary based on age, and there are several pass options available. Details are available at the VTA website, which can be found here:   . Also, for additional information on bus lines 48 and 49, go to these sections of the VTA website:    (line 48) and    (line 49).</field>

		<field name="content">Sometimes La Mirada resembles Mayberry USA (of Andy Griffith Show fame) but it is undeniably Southern California in at least one way: you need a car. Access to a car is required to thrive in and around La Mirada.   But if youre on vacation or your life is pretty centralized around LM, then by all means ditch the gas-guzzler and try life in the bike lane. LM has extensive bike lanes and sidewalk space, making it relatively safe for cyclists and pedestrians.   La Mirada Transit, sometimes referred to as "Dial-a-Ride," also offers convenient door-to-door shuttle service Monday-Saturday at varying times for $1 one-way. Its a bus-taxi hybrid that is quite reliable and especially helpful on rainy days or for those without drivers licenses. Their  website  lists the phone number to arrange pick-up and their hours of operation.</field>

A few of the hotels have shuttles but unless youre already driving youll want to have a rental car.  Traffic is generally pretty light but can be significantly busier in the summer.  When downtown, you can walk to just about everywhere.  Having transportation will give you the ability to visit other places near by like Harbor Springs, Charlevoix, etc. all of which are within about 20 miles of Petoskey.</field>

Bicycles are another option.  For those who want to get around without the effort, golf carts are available for rent.  Some (mostly older residents) use personal scooters as well.  Only foot traffic is allowed in Lakesides parks and walking paths.  Lakeside offers a shuttle service -- an extended golf cart operating on a fixed route every 15 minutes or so on a set route.   Cars are not a useful way to get around lakeside.  Park your car on arrival and keep it parked.  Parking is available by the south entrance (for a fee), at the Danbury High School (just outside Lakesides south gate, for free).  Some cottages have their own garages and parking, and parking lots are available at the hotels.</field>

Howard Transit operates a number of bus routes which circulate through the villages and connect to some adjacent communities.  Most bus routes are hourly, with limited service on weekends.

		<field name="content">Oak Ridge was designed by the government, so the layout of the town is fairly simple, almost utilitarian - in some neighbourhoods, the streets are even in alphabetical order. Having a car is almost necessary, as the city is quite sparsely laid-out. There is virtually no public transportation.</field>

There is no public transportation to speak of in this region, and traffic volume is so low over most of it that hitchhiking is likely to be unrewarding.</field>

		<field name="content">In the city center, the two main hubs are Market Street (running east and west) and Main Street (running north and south). The two streets meet at the center of town, in a small area known as Town Square. It is here that most downtown businesses are, and where weekly "Rally in the Square" events take place during the summer. The yearly "Square Fair" also takes place here in early August.  In the main business district outside of downtown (known as Westgate), main hubs are Elida road (running northwest to southeast) and Cable Road (running North and South). The majority of activities can be found in this area of town, about 5 miles northwest of downtown. Most restaurants, shopping, activities and the Lima Mall are in this area.  If you take Market Street east out of town it will become Bellefontaine (pronounced Bell-fountain) Street, and you will find another business district (known as Eastgate) similar to that near Elida/Cable Roads. This is where I-75 exit 125 meets the city, and the Allen County Fairgrounds are about a mile east of this stretch of businesses on Bellefontaine.</field>

		<field name="content">Currently, the public transportation is called the O-U-T. It has several lines that run through all of the major points around town.  The best way to get around is by foot, as Oxford is a beautiful town to walk and parking is scarce downtown and on campus.  The second best way is by car.  Once you find a place to park on campus, stay there and walk everywhere you want to go.  The same applies to downtown.  Once you figure out how to navigate the square (it will take awhile) and the surrounding one-way streets, you can find a place to park by cruising the back alleys.  If you park illegally, you will get an expensive ticket.  Do not drink and drive as the cops keep a watchful eye on the byways, not to mention you are risking your life and the lives of others.  You can avoid this by walking home, hitching a ride (its easy to find a ride from a friendly stranger on the Square), or calling a cab. Currently, Angel Taxi offers its services for $10 anywhere in Oxford and the immediate area. Another up and coming taxi is Oxford Taxi, started in 2010.</field>

The streets are pedestrian and bicycle friendly - with sidewalks and bike lanes on most major roads, and low traffic on others.   Best Biking Around: Great biking through surrounding vineyards and wheatfields.  To Waitsburg and Dayton, to Milton Freewater and Touchet, numerous 15-60+ mile routes.  But mind those hills! Stop into the following bike shops for info on routes and rides:      The Valley Transit    local bus service runs in the daytime around town, costs only 75 cents  a trip with free transfers, and also provides bike racks on most buses. Its main transfer station is located downtown, and it also runs to the airport.  With many peaceful parks and quiet streets lined with large old, shade trees to wander along and admire the charming neighborhoods, leaving the car behind is more than plausible.  With wheels: Bring your own car to drive around town or out on the country roads with, or rent one from one of four available companies easily found online. Even if you plan to explore mostly on foot, having a car can be a boon for a trip up Mill Creek or getting to some of the wineries located around the airport and out in the country.</field>

		<field name="content">Chapel Hill is an area which largely requires transportation by car outside of the immediate Franklin Street downtown area. While the UNC campus and the downtown area are very pleasantly walkable, anything outside this immediate area can be frustrating on foot, with long distances, fast-moving car traffic, and roads that simply lack sidewalks. Grocery stores are not within walking distance of downtown Chapel Hill, although downtown Carrboro is served by the Weaver Street Market and a Harris Teeter. Limited public transit service around town is provided by the fare-free Chapel Hill Transit bus system.  Curb parking in the downtown area is available but often full, especially while school is in session, making it hard to find a spot. Paid lots and garages are available along Rosemary Street, just north of Franklin Street. Outside of the downtown area, parking is very easy to find.</field>

Much of North Conway’s shops and less interactive attractions are on the town’s main road, Route 16.

		<field name="content">Map of Downtown Disney   Downtown Disney is very linear; you can just walk straight from one end to the other and see pretty much everything.  The northeastern-most end is the Downtown Disney Marketplace, with the bus stops located at the very tip.  The Marketplace curves down and around to the southwest, where it meets up with Pleasure Island.  To the west is, of course, the Downtown Disney West Side, with the La Nouba arena at the far end near the ferry terminal.  The entire strip is sandwiched between parking lots on the south side and Village Lake on the north.  From Village Lake, boats can travel the Sassagoula River, which provides access to the Saratoga Springs, Old Key West and Port Orleans resorts.  The Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza, a set of inexpensive non-Disney resorts on Disney property, lies just to the northeast of the Marketplace.  If youre tired of walking and need to get from one end of Downtown Disney to the other, a free shuttle boat runs between the Marketplace and West Side docks every 15 minutes or somdash;make sure you get on the Green Flag boat.</field>

From Mount Baldy Village it is possible to take Glendora Ridge Road. This road can take you out in Glendora, or continue on all the way to the top of highway 39. Make sure you have enough gas, there are no stops along the way. And check beforehand on road conditions as this route is frequently closed during the winter due to snow and during the summer due to fire hazards. By bicycle If youre of the more athletic sort, the climb up Mount Baldy Road has been used by many. There is normally plenty of space for bicyclists with only a coupld tunnels to worry about sharing some tight space with passing cars. Staying on the lower roads from Euclid to Padua can also provide a nice little loop with some good elevtaion changes. By foot Much of the forest can be enjoyed on foot. Many paths are well-marked and make for some pleasant hiking. The ski lift at Mount Baldy runs throughout much of skiings off-season in order to help some with the climb to the hiking trails found a little higher up.</field>

As of 2008 it only costs $2.00 for the 33 mile bus ride from Santa Maria to San Luis Obispo. The Guadalupe Flyer takes you west of Santa Maria through scenic Highway 166 to Guadalupe. There is also the Breeze Bus which has stops in near Vandenburg Air Force Base, and nearby Lompoc. Public transportation in the valley will take you anywhere you want but a car would be best.</field>

If you are renting a house in one of the many beach suburbs, then beach access is almost always easier by foot. Bicycle travel is also the method of transport favored by many locals, and offers a great experience to view the flora and fauna. There are no real means of obtaining (renting, buying, etc) a bicycle in town, so it is recommended that any visitors bring their own for the best method of transport to a beach. Water Travel is also very popular.  Renting a canoe, or other form of boat is a good way to see the true beauty of Rhode Island.  These are easily rentable at many bait and tackle places listed below.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">The easiest method of getting around Mississippi is by automobile (and, in most cases, it’s the only method of getting around the state).  You can travel around Mississippi by using the  Greyhound Bus lines , but it is a very inconvenient method of traveling around the state.  If you do decide to travel by bus, be prepared for long waits, uncomfortable rides to remote locations (typically the bus stops are at a gas station on the outskirts of the city) and unannounced bus route cancellations.  The hassle of visiting the state by bus is not worth the you money save compared to renting a car; sometimes, you may have to rent a car anyway due to the limited bus routes.    Visitors to Mississippi should seriously consider renting a car (usually, most auto rental locations are at airports: just be sure to make reservations far in advance), as there is not a well-established public transportation system in this state.  Be prepared to seek alternate transportation if you do not have the following: a valid drivers license accepted by the United States, be at least 25 years in age (some rental companies may allow 21 year old adults to rent their vehicles), and a major credit card issued by such companies as: Visa, Diners Club, American Express, Discover Card, or MasterCard.  The lack of such items or being 25 or less will make renting a car very difficult, if not impossible.  You could also consider riding a horse in certain parts of Mississippi, as the low traffic and high amounts of dirt roads make it an ideal place for riding.  Note - It may be very difficult, but it is not impossible to rent a car with a debit card (with the Visa or MasterCard logo) if you lack a credit card.  Rental companies such as Enterprise, Alamo (Enterprise amd Alamos rental restrictions to non-credit card payers typically makes it much more of a hassle to rent from than from other rental agencies), Thrifty, Rent-a-wreck (typically RAW is the easiest company to rent from without a credit card), and Budget car rental will usually rent to customers without a major credit card; however, expect far more restrictions (and hassles) with their rental terms.  Do your research first before exploring this option, and expect to have to speak with a manager rather than the front-line customer service representative you encounter to make any progress.</field>

		<field name="content">The Delaware Valley is extensively served by both the national rail company Amtrak and the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). The main rail station in Philadelphia is 30th Street Station. SEPTA commuter rail extends to Marcus Hook, DE and Trenton, NJ. Southern New Jersey is also served by the Delaware River Port Authoritys PATCO Hi-Speedline which is a hybrid subway and above-ground system.  Taxis can be hailed in the major cities in the Delaware Valley including Philadelphia and Wilmington. For those adventurous enough to drive in these two large, car-congested cities, parking is scarce and roads can be hectic. Defensive driving is ones best bet in Philadelphia and Wilmington, as drivers are known to be both vocal and ruthless.  In Philadelphia, two subway lines and a subway-surface line cover the city. The Broad Street Line runs north-south and the Market-Frankford Line runs east-west. The subway-surface line parallels the MFL and makes stops at smaller stations than the subway of the same direction.</field>

The center of this system is the intersection of Central Avenue and 1st Street on the east side of the small downtown area. With respect to this intersection, the citys streets are named Northeast ("NE"), Northwest ("NW"), Southeast ("SE"), Southwest ("SW"). The direction is very important for addresses! There can be 4 different locations with the address "100 Ave. A". With higher numbered streets/addresses, the distance between these locations can be several miles. The system is simple, but can be very confusing.</field>

		<field name="content">Map of Disneys Animal Kingdom   Animal Kingdom is a very large park, and most of the attractions are outdoors.  You will be walking, and walking a lot, so prepare accordingly.  After going through the entrance gates, youll be in the Oasis area.  While there are no rides or shows here, there are two well-shaded paths that pass by a number of animal enclosures.  The main purpose of the Oasis is to lead you into the park toward Discovery Island, which is the hub from which youll explore the rest of Animal Kingdom.  You cant miss Discovery Island, thanks to the humongous Tree of Life in the center.  Its here youll find most of the shops and a couple restaurants, along with the 3-D movie Its Tough to Be a Bug.  Animal Kingdom has four themed "lands" that surround Discovery Island.  The first one, moving clockwise from the Oasis, is Camp Minnie-Mickey, where kids can meet and greet the Disney characters all day in a summer-camp setting.  Next is Africa, where the Kilimanjaro Safaris take you into the parks savanna.  Asia has the Kali River Rapids and, at its far end, Expedition Everest.  Finally, DinoLand U.S.A. is where youll find Chester Hesters Dino-Rama and the Dino Institute.  Rafikis Planet Watch, a "backstage" area with information on the parks research projects and animal maintenance, is accessed via a short train trip from Africa.  You can walk from Africa to Asia to DinoLand U.S.A. without returning to Discovery Island, but Camp Minnie-Mickey has no such connections.</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around in Milwaukee is easy. Block numbers are consistent across the city, including most of the suburbs, starting roughly where the Milwaukee and Menominee rivers meet. All numbered streets run north-south, increasing in number as you head west from 1st Street. Most named streets go east-west, with the notable exception of streets east of 1st St. Standard blocks are 1/8th of a mile long north to south, and 1/12th of a mile east to west.</field>

		<field name="content">The public transportation in Oroville is not amazing, but strides have been made in recent years to have a more reliable system.  The B-Line    covers not only the core of the town, but also has hourly connections to neighboring towns.  Bicycling can be a wonderful way to see the area, especially in the Fall or Spring when the temperatures are more moderate and the natural scenery pleasing.  Taxis are scarce and not to be seen running around.  You actually have to call a taxi to come to your specific location if you want one and they are not cheap.  While the immediate downtown area is a pleasant walk, to go anywhere else will require your own car.  If you dont have one upon arrival, there are several rental offices in town such as Enterprise and Hertz.</field>

		<field name="content">Metra system map   By Vehicle: Despite its excellent public transportation, personal vehicles remain the best form of transportation in the area.  The interstates are the primary method of vehicle travel, though, mostly to avoid tolls and congestion, many local routes are used.  Below are some commonly traveled routes which tourists may find useful for avoiding traffic:  North-South Routes: : US 41: US 41 (known as "Lake Shore Drive" in Chicago) is a primary north-south route.  It connects the Far North Suburbs, North Shore, City and South Suburbs. : US 45: US 45 is a primary north-shore and connects the Far North Suburbs, Northwestern Suburbs, Immediate Suburbs and Southern Suburbs. : IL 53: IL 53 is a unique route that primarily serves as a connection point between various points of the Northwestern Suburbs.  However, it is a important thoroughfare for connection to local interstates.  There are current plans to extend it into the Chain OLakes/Far North Suburbs. : IL 59: IL 59 connects the Chain OLakes to the Northwestern Suburbs and Western Suburbs before terminating in Naperville. : IL 31: IL 31 is the major north-south route connecting the Chain OLakes and Fox River Valley.   East-West Routes: : IL 120: IL 120 is the primary connection between the Far North Suburbs and the Chain OLakes.  It terminates near Woodstock in McHenry County. Through much of the Far North Suburbs, this route is open freeway. : US 12: US 12 runs on a northwest-southeast route through the entire region and connects the South Suburbs directly to the City and then runs northwest connecting the Northwestern Suburbs to the Chain OLakes. : Lake-Cook Road: A major east-west route, this road is technically the border between Lake and Cook Counties but also connects the North Shore to the Northwestern Suburbs and Fox River Valley. :US 14: Like US 12, US 14 runs a northwest-south route through the entire region.  It originates in the City and then connects it to the Northwestern Suburbs, Fox River Valley and McHenry County before exiting the region.  Through much of its course, it runs alongside the Union Pacific Northwest Metra Line. :US 20: A major east-west arterial, this route connects the City to the Immediate and Western Suburbs and the Fox River Valley.  Through Elgin, the route is open freeway. :North Avenue: A major east-west route, North Avenure originates in the City and runs through the Immediate and Western Suburbs into the Fox River Valley. :Ogden Avenue: Another route originating in the City, Odgen connects the City to many of the Immediate Suburbs, the Western Suburbs and Aurora. :US 30: A major-east west through, US 30 primarily serves the South Suburbs.  By Train: Chicagolands Metra commuter train system is one of the most connected and advanced in the United States containing 241 Stations on 11 routes.  Below is a brief outline of each the train routes (a full list of stops and schedules is available on  Metras website :  BNSF Railway: Provides daily service between Chicagos Union Station and Aurora through much of the Western Suburbs.  Heritage Corridor: Daily service between Union Station and Joliet (this is one of two routes originating in Joliet).  Milwaukee District North Line: Connects Chicagos Union Station and  Fox Lake , the anchor of the Chain OLakes.  It provides service through the Northwestern and Far North Suburbs as well.  Milwaukee District West Line: Connects Union Station and Elgin passing through many of the Northwestern Suburbs inbetween.  North Central Service: Provides service between Union Station and  Antioch  in the Chain O Lakes.  It connects many of the Northwestern and Far North Suburbs in between.  Rock Island District: Connects LaSalle Street Station to Joliet and passes through many southern suburbs.  Southwest Service: Connects Union Station to  Manhattan  through the South Suburbs.  Union Pacific North Line: One of Metras most heavily traveled lines, the North Line connects Ogilvie Station with Waukegan and  Kenosha .  Union Pacific Northwest Line: Another of the regions most heavily traveled lines, the Northwest Line connects Ogilvie to  Crystal Lake  and  Harvard .  It provides service to most of the Northwestern Suburbs, a portion of the Fox River Valley and McHenry County.  Union Pacific West Line: The West Line connects Ogilvie and extends to  Elburn , connecting many Immediate and West Suburbs as well as portions of the Fox River Valley.  Elburn is actually considered part of the greater  Northern Illinois  region.  By Bus: Two major bus systems service the region: the Chicago Transportation Authority (CTA) and Pace.  CTA services Chicago while PACE covers the rest of the region.  Visit their websites for more information:  Chicago Transportation Authority  and  Pace .  By Subway/L: The CTA also manages the Chicago subway and elevated rail (L) system.  Since the majority of the system serves the actual city, most information can be found there.  However, certain CTA stops are in the greater region including  Wilmette ,  Evanston ,  Skokie ,  Rosemont ,  Cicero ,  Forest Park , and  Oak Park , which makes those respective lines sometimes an easier alternative to vehicle or Metra for access to the city.</field>

Fare is $1.25 ($0.60 for children/seniors), with monthly passes available for $35.  Lincoln Way is the main east-west thoroughfare of the city, running from just south of downtown west to Campustown and along the southern edge of the central campus of ISU.  Similarly, 13th St runs across the northern edges of the downtown area and the university campus.  Main north-south roads include Duff Ave and Grand Ave (which together carry U.S. Hwy 69 through Ames), University Boulevard and North and South Dakota Avenues.  Ames is very bicycle friendly, with a moderately extensive paved  trail system  for walking and biking.  Apart from ISU itself, there are generally three main pedestrian-friendly concentrations of shops and restaurants:  Downtown on Main Street between Clark and Duff Avenues, Campustown south of Lincoln Way along either side of Welch Ave, and the much newer Somerset neighborhood (to the east of Stange Ave north of 24th St). Not quite so pedestrian friendly but with new sidewalks is the two miles of big box stores and strip malls along Duff Avenue between US 30 on the south and Lincoln Way on the north.</field>

The traffic is usually not a problem once you pass the edges of Seattles suburban sprawl outside  Issaquah , except during major holiday weekends.  Weather conditions can be a different story, particularly during the winter months when heavy fog, rain, and snow are all commonplace.  During ski season, traffic is often delayed or temporarily stopped near the summit for avalanche control work.  Weather conditions on either side of the pass can differ sharply; check the  pass conditions  before setting out.  During particularly heavy snowstorms, the pass may close entirely for a day or two.  Summer driving is usually pleasant, with good conditions and sweeping forest views on the west side of the pass.  The east side is undergoing road construction and widening through 2016, with routine hour-long closures in both directions on summer weekday evenings for rock blasting.</field>

		<field name="content">By car is really the only way in or out. US-101 makes a loop of the Olympic Peninsula, but only some spur roads actually lead into the park. The interior is roadless and is only accesible to backpackers. Most people visit either the parks beach section, which is accessible only on US-101 between  Forks  and Aberdeen, or Hurricane Ridge, which is accessed from a road out of  Port Angeles .  Access points from the more remote east side are Staircase (turn west off 101 in Hoodsport) or Quilcene (closer to the Hood Canal Bridge).  The best way to see the park is to drive from Aberdeen on northbound US-101 and "do the loop", ending in Olympia, taking three or four days to visit the coastal section (Kalaloch Campground or Lodge are great places to stay), the rainforest (Hoh), Ozette (an easy three mile hike in, or do the easy nine mile loop, tides permitting), Lake Cresent, Hurricane Ridge, and Staircase.  Campground reservations are recommended in the summer.</field>

		<field name="content">Visitors to Missoula often remark that the city is hard to get around in by car, a fact Missoulians famously owe to conflicting city engineers at the turn of the century. The confusing roadways make the city bus system a great way to get around -- but with a little orienting, the city can be much more easily navigated.  Higgins Avenue runs from downtown in the northern end of town through the outskirts of the tree-lined streets of the university district until it takes a sharp curve to the west in the south end of town, leading mainly to residential areas.  Broadway Street runs east to west, mostly along the Clark Fork river, from Van Buren, entrance to the  Rattlesnake Recreation Area  and the hippest place to live in town, through downtown before bisecting with Highway 93 and continuing on to the airport and I-90.  Orange Street runs through downtown and another treed residential area before intersecting with Brooks Street.  Brooks Street begins as Highway 93 from  Lolo  to the south of Missoula before turning into Brooks Street, a major shopping area populated with strip malls, fast food restaurants and the like, before dead ending into Higgins in a particularly confusing no-right-turn intersection.  Russell Street runs north - south from Broadway to 39th, through residential, industrial and business districts, but is a main roadway for motorists.  Reserve Street runs from I-90 to 39th from the north - south, crossing Broadway, 3rd Street, South Avenue and Brooks Street before dead ending. Major box stores, such as Target and Wal-Mart, as well as movie theaters, restaurants and other businesses line the thoroughfare.</field>

Most off-the-beaten-path attractions (which most are) must be accessed by the many scenic roads running through the high plains and mountains of the area.  Private vehicle is practically the only way to travel in the area, but cycling could be enjoyable (and physically demanding) on many of the smaller highways.  U.S. Route 26 is located in the northern part of Eastern Oregon and runs from the coast to the  Idaho  border.  U.S. Route 20 travels east-west through the center and south part of the state, providing access to  Burns  and its attractions until it crosses into  Idaho .  U.S. Route 395 makes its way roughly NNE through Oregon and passes from the OR- CA  state line to  Idaho , passing through  Lakeview ,  Riley , and  John Day  on its way.</field>

The signage throughout the park is excellent and the paved roads are well-maintained.   There are two main roads in the park: TX-118, which travels from the parks west entrance near Maverick Junction eastbound 23nbsp;mi (37nbsp;km) until it meets the other main road, US-385 at Panther Junction, where there is a gas station and park headquarters. From here TX-118 continues southeast, ending after 20nbsp;mi (32nbsp;km) at Rio Grande Village, where gas can also be purchased. Back at the junction, US-385 begins here and heads northwards for 26nbsp;mi (42nbsp;km) to the north entrance, near Persimmon Gap. These two roads form the shortest route through the park.</field>

		<field name="content">There are several ways to get around Bethlehem, depending on where you are and where youre intending to go.  If youre sticking to the downtown areas, you can easily cover it on foot.  Its important to realize that there are two downtown areas.  "Downtown" usually refers to the historic district on the northern side of the River, centered along Main Street.  However, it can also refer to the area on the south side along 3rd/4th St. on the other side of the Lehigh River, usually referred to as "South Side".  Both can be covered on foot, but to go between them probably requires a car/bus.  You can walk it, but it is a little more than a mile walk, most of it over the Hill-to-Hill bridge.  Your best bet for parking downtown is the North Street garage, a short walk from the historic district (downtown).  If your travel involves going to other residential neighborhoods or neighboring towns, its probably best to go by car, bus, or taxi.</field>

		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">A car is highly recommended although during the more temperate seasons such as the fall and spring a nice bike ride may be in order. But beware that climatic conditions in the park can be extreme so always check the weather forecast prior to entering and plan your activities accordingly.  Note that most weather forecasts for the park refer to locations within the low altitude portion of the park and weather conditions at higher elevations can be dramatically different.  The paved roads within the park are well-maintained and accessible to vehicles of all kind, but dirt roads (with the exception of the west side around around the Badwater Salt Flats) are rough.  Many use a vehicle with moderately high clearance such as a four-wheel drive, but a 4 wheel drive is not essential to visit any of the main sights listed below (except Echo Canyon). Expect excessive washboarding, erosion, large rocks, and uneven surfaces when traveling on the parks dirt roads.  While well maintained paved roads traverse the park from east to west and to the south, most park features other than the visitor center will require some degree of off road travel.  In most cases, this will consist of graded dirt/gravel roads.  This should not be a problem for a sensibly driven SUV but all drivers should exercise caution: dont leave Furnace Creek without a full tank of gas, make sure your space tire is serviceable, carry enough water for all passengers to last at least 24 hours (1 qt. per person minimum), dont rely on a cell phone in an emergency, carry a detailed park map and know how to read it.  There is likely no other place in the lower 48 states were a traveler could so easily fall off the beaten path than in Death Valley.  This advice is not meant to scare you but to remind you that overland travel in the park is serious business.  The best way to travel in the park and to see the most is a with a high clearance 4x4.  This designation is used throughout the park maps to describe what vehicles should or could attempt certain routes.  Only short sections of some routes might be classified as hard core but what makes the park so challenging is the length of some of the roads.  Most tours into remote ares require at least an eight hour commitment if starting from Furnace Creek, plan accordingly.  Before planning any driving off of the paved roads check with the visitor center or the park website for the latest road condition updates.</field>

		<field name="content">When it comes to getting around in Newport, it all depends on the weather. The temperature varies a bit from season to season, but it pretty much stays between 50 and 70 degrees throughout the whole year. When the rain holds off, walking and biking are huge modes of transportation, and they sure do save you some money too. HWY 101 would have to be the easiest way of getting just about anywhere in Newport that you wanted to go. If you take it to the South side of town, it will take you across the bridge to our famous Aquarium and Rogue Brewery. However, if you choose to see the light house or the bayfront, right before you cross the Newport Bridge, HWY 101 will also give you the opportunity to hook to the right and follow the signs that will lead you to the two destinations. All of the grocery stores and convenience stores are mainly located on HWY 101 as well, along with a few pretty good restaurants. A few other streets to look for while youre in Newport are:   Ocean Dr.: This street will take you along the northern part of Newports Coast. While on it you will located a number of very nice hotels to choose from, along with one of Newports most famous restaurants, "Georgies Bar and Grill", towards the northern end of it.   Eads St.: This street you will find yourself passing if you are coming into town from HWY 20. It is a rather short street, but will give you a nice idea of what our neighborhoods are like, along with presenting to you Newports high school.   Bayfront Dr.: The name of the street says it all, but in case you have never heard of Newports Bayfront, this road will take you right along it, showing off all of Newports unique and enjoyable antique and entertainment shops. You will find certain attractions such as "Ripleys Believe It or Not" and "Wax Works" on this street as well.</field>

Leaving the area to the north generally means passing through one of two major mountain passes--the Dreamy Draw via State Route 51 or around Camelback Mountain and through the Town of Paradise Valley via 44th St. to MacDonald Dr. and then north along Tatum Blvd.  Either route offers some stunning views of urban desert mountain settings.</field>

		<field name="content">Most of the restaurants, hotels, shops and sights are located on Main Street, within easy reach of each other on foot (save for snowstorms). Free parking is available in the lot on Sherman Street which is a few blocks from main street, but there is metered parking scattered throughout most of the town as well. There is also a parking garage near main street. A trolley service runs Sunday-Thursday 7AM to 1:30AM and Friday Saturday 7AM to 3AM for most of the year, but Sunday-Thursday hours are reduced to 8AM to 12:00 midnight during the winter. The cost is very cheap at $1 per ride.  The Visitors Bureau (767 Main Street, 1-800-999-1876) has maps and the usual array of tour brochures. Theyre also available at the History and Information Center on Sherman Street.  Driving in Deadwood is fairly easy, as the streets are lightly trafficked and all of the sights are either on Main Street or clearly marked. Deadwood winters can be very severe, however, so if you want to rent a car in the winter months (Late September-Late April, with snow still being possible as late as May and even June) be sure it can get around.  Recently, a company called Rushmore Segway has been offering guided, 90-minute Segway tours of the town. The tour office is located at the Days of 76 Rodeo grounds.</field>

		<field name="content">Once in Wildwood, it is incredibly easy to navigate your way around.  If needed, the entire island is walkable.  However, many people choose to drive for time and convenience purposes. Be careful though, parking can be expensive!   Many residents and tourists choose to ride their own bikes, or rent them from one of the several rental facilities in the town. You can rent singles, doubles, or even family sized bikes. It is also very common to see people on skates and skateboards.  To get from place to place on the boardwalk, which spans numerous miles, many choose to hop aboard the tram car, which is a small, trolley-like vehicle that drives solely from one end of the boardwalk to the other, and is relatively inexpensive, one way only costing approximately $3.00.    Taxi cabs and NJ Transit buses also operate through Wildwood, both which are cost effective, and are available constantly.  There are three different taxi services located in the Wildwoods, Caribbean, Checkers, and Pink.  They can pick you up anywhere in Wildwood within about 5 minutes.  This is the safest way to get around at night, especially if you are drinking, for the cops in Wildwood are diligent.</field>

		<field name="content">Several viewpoints and trailheads in the park have limited or no parking and must be reached using the park shuttle system.  The National Park Service runs an extensive shuttle service on the South Rim     with three interlocking routes. The service is free, and generally runs from before sunrise until after sunset, depending on the route.  Service is more frequent from May through September and includes additional routes.  In addition, during the summer the park service operates a shuttle from  Tusayan  into the park.  Horse and mule riders are required to follow a number of rules and restrictions while in the park, and must get a permit from the park service to keep animals in the park overnight.  From Mar-Nov the West Rim Drive is not accessible to most private vehicles (handicap vehicles may request a variance at the entry gate).  The park service runs a shuttle during this time.  The shuttles are frequent but long lines form during the busy summer months.  There is no easy connection between the North and South rims.  By car, the shortest route is a five-hour drive crossing the river by a bridge near Lees Ferry; by foot, it is a two-day hike across the canyon.</field>

		<field name="title">Cedar Rapids</field>
		<field name="main">get around</field>
		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">All addresses in the city are based upon a quadrant system.  The system divides the city into four directional quadrants with addresses that may look something like this:    500 33rd Ave SW  The quadrant systems base is the insection of the Cedar River and 1st Avenue.  Although seemingly simple to an observer, this system is nearly useless to visitors since the intersecting lines essentially form an "X" on  a map rather than a "+".  Also, visitors should note that along I-380 (North/South interstate corridor) and the surrounding downtown area, traffic cameras are utilized to enforce speed and red-light laws. The Cedar Rapids Police Department (CRPD) has suggested that no additional cameras will be placed, although this hasnt been confirmed by any other agency. The photo-enforcement begins at various speeds over the posted limit, but you generally will not be cited for speeds between 1 and 8 over the limit on the interstate. Lower tolerance is used on city streets, and fairly strict enforcement applies to red-light violations.   Driving in Cedar Rapids can be a hassle compared to cities of similar size. First, major thoroughfares (1st Avenue, Collins Rd., Blairs Ferry Rd., and Edgewood Road) have traffic lighting patterns that are inefficient. You will likely feel as if youre "catching every light." Although this is true in many cities, Cedar Rapidians agree that it is decidedly worse here. Additionally, the roads are insufficient for the volume of traffic during peak travel hours. This means that the city becomes a rolling traffic snarl for an hour around high-traffic areas (Lindale Mall), and the traffic backup rivals that of larger cities.  If you happen to travel in the adjacent city of Marion, be aware of the posted speed limit. Rumors of excessive enforcement are exaggerated -- but only slightly! The speed limit inconspicuously drops to 20 mph on major roads, and the Marion Police Department is all too happy to cite unfamiliar vehicles.</field>

		<field name="content">Navigating the streets of Boston is difficult if you are not familiar with the area.  While other American cities have their streets laid out in a grid ( New York ,  Chicago ,  Indianapolis ,  Philadelphia ,  Phoenix ), or along a river, lake, or other geographical feature ( New Orleans ,  Cleveland ), the modern streets of Boston are a twisty and seemingly incomprehensible maze.  Boston in the 1600s was a narrow peninsula surrounded by farmland and distant settlements.  Landfill, urban expansion, waves of radical economic change, and new technologies have seen sensible street patterns added on to and collide in less sensible ways.  Due to dense development, the older street patterns have largely remained in place without being adapted to their modern surroundings.  In this way, Boston is more similar to old European cities than most typical large American cities that were geometrically planned, expanded into unsettled land, or were mainly settled in the late 20th century. Streets in Boston not only turn of their own volition, but often vanish for no particular reason or change names. If you intend to drive in Boston, a GPS or smartphone with GPS capabilities are essential, because Boston streets and avenues have no rhyme or reason to their layout, and signs are often conspicuously lacking.</field>

There are also several taxi services, however these are in very high demand in the winter, and waits of 30-60 minutes are not uncommon in peak times.  During summer months, BlueGo offers transportation around the South Shore both by their bus service, but also by several streetcar-like trolleys under the name "Nifty Fifty Trolley", in reference to US Route 50, South Tahoes main road, and the route upon which they travel.  All major locations around the Heavenly Village area such as the stateline casinos, are within walking distance (one quarter mile) of each other. There are underground walkways between the major casinos.</field>

Walk a little further to visit the Arcata Community Forest, university, or marsh.   Bike lanes abound. Loaner bikes can be checked out of the bike library, in the North Coast Co-op employee parking lot.   Three local bus lines ( Blue Lake Transit ) cover the outer reaches of Arcata and run until 10PM on weekdays. Students with an HSU ID ride for free on AMRTS and HTA.   The county bus can take you from  Scotia  to  Trinidad .   Regarding transportation, the Humboldt County Association of Governments (HCOAG) is currently revising its Regional Transit Plan, a process occuring every two years which affects the City of Arcata.  There is a "Rails to Trails" movement to use existing railroad tracks along the eastern edge of Humboldt Bay for promoting safe bicycle and pedestrian recreation and commuting between Arcata and Eureka.  In opposition is an effort to bring back the railroad to promote the movement of goods from north to south, paralleling Highway 101.  An additional effort is being made to change the use of the local railroad tracks from movement of goods to movement of people as a light-rail system to reduce automotive transport to and from the main service sector--the neighboring city of Eureka.</field>

Cars can be rented in Kahului Airport (all major rental companies have offices there) or in other locations throughout the island.  Most hotels usually provide parking for their guests only, sometimes for an additional fee. Parking is available at the Whalers Village shopping center, for a fee, but they will validate your ticket in stores and restaurants. If you go to one of the hotels for a luau, there is usually parking for the event, also for a fee in most cases.  There is a shuttle between main Kaanapali hotels and Whalers Village center.  The local bus is $1 per ride.  (You can take a Sugar Cane Train between Kaanapali and Lahaina, but this should be done for entertainment only.)  You can rent a bicycle locally, or bring your own bicycle (folding bikes usually can be carried in a bag as luggage without attracting any extra charges). The main roads have paved shoulders marked as "Bike Route", and motorists are fairly relaxed.   You can use a beautiful path along the beach to walk between major hotels.</field>

		<field name="content">Within the I-440 Beltline are mostly fashionable older neighborhoods and the NC State University area.  The North Raleigh neighborhoods are aligned along the "spokes of the wheel"—major thoroughfares emanating from the I-440 Loop and passing through the northern edge of the much larger I-540 loop.  Downtown Raleigh provides easy travel and access through its grid of one-way streets. If youre just passing through, the major thoroughfare is Capital Boulevard (US 401), which splits into Dawson Street heading south and McDowell Street heading north. From the west, it is Hillsborough Street, interrupted midway by the state Capitol building. To the east, it continues as New Bern Avenue (US 64).   The I-440 Beltline was once denoted with "Inner" and "Outer" labels, but they have been phased out in favor of "East" and "West."  I-440 West was previously the Outer Beltline, and I-440 East was previously the Inner Beltline.  I-440s concurrency with I-40 through the souther portion of Raleigh has also been removed; therefore, the Beltline no longer loops back on itself.  Raleigh is known for particularly aggressive parking enforcement and towing, so be sure to follow all parking signs and rules.</field>

		<field name="content">Automobiles are generally the easiest ways of traveling in Terre Haute. Pedestrian travel is the best on the north portion of the city (including Wabash Avenue), but several of the cross-streets on Third Street have short traffic signals. While there is no "rush hour" like those seen in larger cities, during the afternoon and early evening, the south end of town on U.S. 41 can become hectic. Also, many people cannot manage to drive the speed limit.  Bicycling is becoming increasingly popular due to the heightened gas prices, although cyclers should use caution when riding, as bike lanes and paths are still few and far between. Sidewalks are usually the preferred paths for bikes, but some of the sidewalks on secondary roads are in poor condition. This is being improved by the city.</field>

Most hotel parking is valet/remote/expensive/difficult at best. New Orleans is ready for visitors, and the rapid transit, trolley cars and buses are plentiful 24/7. Walking is fun and healthy during daylight and early evening. After  midnight, you may want to call a taxi, but likely it will be a short trip at reasonable cost. For a great way to see the city, try renting a bike from one of the several bike rental companies in the French Quarter or Marigny.</field>

There are buses downtown, but routes are lacking compared to other cities of similar size   . Cars can be rented at the Boise Airport from major rental companies including Hertz, Avis, and Enterprise   . Traffic in Boise is relatively light and peaceful, however during high-traffic hours Interstate 184, Capitol Boulevard, and State Street should be avoided.  The Boise Greenbelt is a paved pedestrian and bike path that stretches nearly 22 miles from Lucky Peak Reservoir to the east of Boise, all the way through town   . For avid bikers and walkers, much of the river and Boises parks can be accessed this way.</field>

As an alternative, taxis are also available at the airport though renting a car is almost always more practical.  The countys Hele-On Bus system ($1 fare) does not serve Hilo International Airport.  Its a good idea to make car reservations in advance, as special events or active conditions at the Volcanoes National Park can quickly deplete the supply of available vehicles.

For the public benefit, most gas stations post large, comprehensive free maps near their restrooms.    To aid the process of navigating the Quad Cities, a  wayfinding  color code system has been established for signs that direct people to various venues and attractions in the area.  The area is divided into quadrants with their own colors and identifying headers on direction signs have the appropriate color for each quadrant so that travelers know, by color, which quadrant you are in and to which color you will have to travel to reach other attractions.  The northwest quadrant (Davenport) use the green color in the header, the northeast quadrant (Bettendorf) is yellow, the southeast quadrant (Moline-East Moline) is blue and the southwest quadrant (Rock Island) is red.</field>

		<field name="content">Boulder and Denver share a common mass transit system, known as RTD   . which won "Best Public Transportation" in a nationwide survey in 2008.  You will also notice that a large percentage of locals use bicycles to get around the down town (most of the city sights are within 2 miles).  If you choose to drive around town, be aware that there is heavy traffic on the main thoroughfares, high numbers of pedestrians (cyclists) and parking downtown can be a bit tight.  There are a number of city-owned garages tucked behind the buildings downtown.  Keep your eyes open for the large green "P" signs outside their entrance ramps, as they dont look like parking garages from the outside.  Be careful when parking in the University area, as tickets can be quite expensive.  Boulders police are vigilant about drunk driving, so try to keep out of the car when you find yourself tipping down a local microbrew or two.  Watch carefully for the school zones:  when the yellow lights are flashing, slow down to 20 mph! Many of the main streetlights have cameras that can capture you running the tail end of yellow lights. Watch out, or you may get tickets in the mail!  Many locals use the "Skyride" RTD bus to get to and from the airport.  Its greener and easier.</field>

		<field name="content">Street view near downtown Windsor  The town of Windsor is almost completely flat, and most streets have sidewalks, so walking is feasible for relatively short distances. The town has been modifying streets to add bike lanes, and plans to continue to add to them.    The town is actually one of the best in California for getting around by bike, though not many locals do so.  Sonoma County Transit has one bus line, Route 66, that provides service within Windsor. There is one local taxi company, Windsor Express Taxi, but both Santa Rosa and Healdsburg are close enough for their taxi companies to provide service to addresses within Windsor.</field>

		<field name="content">The elevator to the Big Room leaves from within the visitor center, and the walk from the visitor center to the natural entrance of the Big Cave is very short.  Most of the trail in the Big Room is wheelchair-accessible.  Flat-soled shoes are strongly recommended for the hike into the cave from the natural entrance, and a good idea if entering the cave via the elevator.  Running shoes (particularly cross-trainers) or  light hiking boots work well.  Many publications assert that the temperature in the Big Cave is "a constant 56 degrees F," but the truth is a little more complicated.  The temperature varies from place to place within the cave, and atmospheric conditions can create small temperature variations in some locations as well.  However, 56 degrees F (13 degrees C) is a good number for planning purposes.  Take a light jacket or wrap into the cave, even if its beastly hot outdoors.  If planning to do any backcountry hiking, make sure to take plenty of water and sunscreen; there is precious little shade, and no reliable water sources.  Serious hiking boots are a very good idea, as the terrain is rough, plants are thorny, and rattlesnakes (though rarely encountered) typically strike at the ankle level.  In the backcountry, long pants are a better idea than shorts, if you can stand the heat; a little protection from spines and thorns goes a long way.</field>

		<field name="content">Driving, riding the bus, walking, and cycling are convenient ways to get around town.  The Cache Valley Transit District (website:   ) bus system serves Logan and surrounding communities with a simple route system that radiates out from the transit center every half hour.  All buses are equipped to carry two or three bicycles.  Main Street is heavily used and often congested but parallel streets often provide faster access within Logan.  Utah State University, on the east side of town, sits on the Provo Bench of ancient Lake Bonneville, about 250 feet higher than downtown Logan.  This elevation difference is a major deterrent to non-motorized transportation.  Streets throughout the old grid part of town are wide, thanks to the admonition of Brigham Young to lay out early Utah cities with streets wide enough to turn a double-team of horses and a buck-board around, so there is plenty of room for cyclists.</field>

Most of this area follows the same river-aligned grid as downtown.  Like downtown, streets parallel the river and avenues are perpendicular to it; the only exception to this rule is University Avenue, which in Southeast is actually the equivalent of "3rd St SE". Younger people might have fun visiting the famous Dinkytown area and hanging out at a coffee shop.  Its located nearby 14th Ave and 4th St SE. The Prospect Park neighborhood is also part of Southeast Minneapolis, but it has an entirely different street grid, with winding streets with Anglophone names, such as Seymour, Warwick, and Arthur.</field>

The Joseph Scelsi Intermodal Transportation Center, 1 Columbus Avenue, the hub for the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority.    The BRTA offers service stretching from  North Adams  above Pittsfield, down to  Great Barrington  below it. Service runs roughly from 6AM to 7PM, with trips usually running once an hour, though it can vary by route. There is no service on Sundays. Fares are $1.25 per city traveled, with half-fare for seniors, and discounted to $1.05 if you buy a 20-fare passcard. The buses are generally clean and quiet, and only heavily occupied during rush hour times. Rainbow Taxi is the sole taxicab provider for the area, and can be reached at +1 413-499-4300. You will need to call a taxi in order to be picked up, instead of flagging one. Be warned that during inclement weather or rush hour the wait for a taxi to arrive can easily be a half-hour or longer. Walking is also an option, as the city is fairly small and safe. Many parts of the city are reachable with an hour or less of walking, especially if youre staying at the Crowne Plaza.</field>

There is a well maintained bicycle and hiking path accessible from the Westville Recreation area on the border of Sturbridge and Southbridge that has a connecting bridge at the dam area. An easy walk about a 2 mile loop. A different way to travel around town is also by kayaking and boating. There are numerous rivers and ponds that will allow you to travel from one section to another by water. This is very scenic and shows off the wildlife and environment of the countryside. Driving also allows you to see the damage from the tornado that hit (June 2011). You are able to see the direct path that it took.</field>

The only exception is the Disneyland Railroad at Main Street. If a guest cannot get up and down steps in order to get into the attraction (Finding Nemo and Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough) there is a room with a virtual experience of the attraction. See a cast member to access these rooms. Outside of the park, a car is again the best way to get around, though many hotels and restaurants are just across the street.  The city of Anaheim also runs a  shuttle service  to the nearby hotels and the Anaheim GardenWalk.  To make getting around a breeze, the Disneyland Monorail links Disneylands Tomorrowland with Downtown Disney (theme park admission is required to board at the Downtown Disney station). However, it may sometimes be slow and inconvenient, usually at park opening. The Downtown Disney station closes 30 minutes before park closing and the Tomorrowland station closes 5 minutes before park closes.  From the Mickey and Friends parking structure you can board a tram to Downtown Disney/Main Entrance Plaza (World of Disney Store) and back. A bus shuttle service takes guests to the satellite parking lots (Puumba and Toy Story). The trams and buses run until one hour after the later park closing (usually Disneyland Park).</field>

The North and South are Del Prado, Santa Barbara, and Chiquita (taken from easternmost to westernmost).  The Cape is large and flat, areas are laid out far from one another; driving is a must. Cape Coral is the 2nd largest city in Florida by square mileage, so expect things to be spread out.   The southernmost tip has the largest concentration of businesses and homes.  A bike lane is provided and can be a handy way to navigate the SE and SW portions if youre inclined to be in those residential only areas.</field>

By Car - Many of the roads in Lake Arrowhead may seem very confusing to someone who is not familiar with the area. As with many small mountain communities, there are many unmarked access roads as well roads that meander for seemingly endless distances. However, all major routes are clearly posted throughout the community.   Hitch-Hike- People use this as a form of transportation from time to time in Lake Arrowhead and surrounding communities, but its reliability can be less than desirable. It is a perfectly legal form of transportation on all surface streets in the Mountain Communities. However, according to California law it is illegal to hitchhike from freeways (which Lake Arrowhead lacks), and it is also illegal to stand in the road to solicit a ride (CA Vehicle Code Section 21957), so make sure you are on the sidewalk or far shoulder!</field>

		<field name="content">Though the town of North Smithfield is small in size, there is an abundance of historic houses, sites, landmarks and mills enriched with history to visit. Originally settled in the 17th century by British colonists it started out prodominately as a farming community. Located along the Blackstone River, mills were later built along the river. These mills are still standing today, some of them are open to public tours and others have been turned into luxury living communities or offices.  If you are into old, historical New England architecture, then consider checking out the historic Slatersville Congregational Church. Built in the early 1800s this historic white colonial church features an old piano, organ and the original pwes and balcony. The church is open for viewing Monday - Friday from 9 am - 12 pm and worship is open to all on Sundays from 10-11 with a coffee hour following the service. The service is open to all religions and all people.   The historic Slatersville Public Library may be of another interest to some. This Public library was also built in the 1800s right on the Blackstone river. Behind the library lies an old bridge as well as remnants of old mill engineering devices.   If you are into historic school houses, the Forestdale Red School House is also located here. Though this old one room school house is no longer used for educational purposes, it is open to tours.</field>

Some bus service may be available from the local transit authority -  DART .You can check the DART web site for more information, scheduling, and even a handy route planner application that will help you plot how to get where youd like to go.    The  Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex  doesnt have an extensive public transit system as yet.  Public transit here is very young and hasnt had the decades of service that other similarly sized areas (e.g. Chigago, London, New York, etc.) to develop.  The recent economic downturn has prompted DART to make announcements about reductions in service due to lost sales tax revenue, so be sure to check the current schedules before planning a trip.    Otherwise, it is probably advisable to rent a car.  The  Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex  unlike many other locations, has not been limited by geographgy (e.g. Manhattan Island) so instead of building up, the sprawl has spread outward.  If you are planning to travel beyond University Park, renting a car is likely the most convenient way to travel.</field>

		<field name="content">A map showing all of Rochester, but not the surrounding towns.  If you are only going to the Clinic, you may not need a car as most hotels provide (free) shuttle service to the Clinic.  However, most visitors will want or need a car to get around.  Parking.  In most areas of Rochester, parking is not an issue, with plenty of surface parking.  The only exceptions are downtown and near the Clinic.  It is possible to find street parking downtown, although difficult in the inner downtown.  Note that the time limit on parking meters is enforced even for cars with handicap parking placards.  The city-owned parking lots are free nights and weekends, with the first hour free during weekdays.  However, the privately-owned lots do not offer this, so look for the "free evening parking" signs if you want to take advantage of this.  The signage downtown is pretty much non-existent, so youre own your own to find the lots.  If you are going to the Clinic, there are Mayo-owned lots near the primary patient-care buildings; Mayo provides a map showing them.  Rates are $2 for the first hour, $1 per hour thereafter.  You can purchase 5 or 10 day passes which allow in-and-out in the same day.  They also do not need to be used on consecutive days.  The Mayo lots sometimes fill during the morning hours, but turnover is very quick and you are unlikely to wait more than 10 min.   Public bus system : There is a public bus system, but it is likely not to be useful to the visitor.  There is no bus service on Sundays or holidays, and during the rest of the week, they will stop running fairly early, generally the last routes end at 9PM. The main goal of the bus system is to serve the downtown area.  Also, the bus system revolves around the Mayo Clinic schedule, so if the Clinic were to close early (Christmas Eve and New Years Eve), the buses will also stop running early as well.  The buses run generally on an hourly basis with half hour service during the rush hours.  The bus system utilizes a wagon-wheel-spoke type of grid, with routes all ending up in the downtown area to make transfers.  You can request a transfer pass from one bus to the next if you are getting on a bus to get to another part of the city.  On Tuesdays, there is a Shoppers bus that will get you to some of the different shopping areas in Rochester. A bus terminal was recently made downtown, with electric signs telling when the bus route is scheduled, and whether is is on time or delayed (like an airport).  The central part of the city is arranged on a more-or-less standard grid.  Streets run east-west and avenues run north-south.  This divides the city into four quadrants, NW, NE, SE, SW.  There are some named streets you might encounter.  The dividing line between east and west is Broadway (up to about 25th St north when things get weird).  The dividing line between north and south is Center St.  Civic Center Drive runs east-west from Hwy 52 to downtown approximately at 5th St. NW.  West Circle Dr. (also called CR 22) runs north-south at the west edge of town.  There is also an East Circle Dr, but there are fewer businesses there.  In case youre wondering, the two circle drives do not meet, yet they are both CR 22. They are both 4-lane expressways.  Most of the newer residential development in the last 15 years has largely abandoned the numbered grid system and gone to named curved streets.  If you need to find these, there are free maps available in most hotels and the local phone book.</field>

		<field name="content">Pittsburgh is difficult for strangers to get around in because the roads go every which way, constrained by the rivers and hills. Many are one-way and nearly all are narrow, as they were laid out in the days of horse-and-buggy transportation. Those with a GPS navigation device should get around all right.  For those without, a taxi is an option until you get used to the roads, but the public transit, operated by the Port Authority (see below), works quite well for travel within the city.  If you do find yourself lost or unsure, however, do not be afraid to ask for help.  Many locals are so friendly - and giving directions can be so confusing - that they might just show you to your destination themselves.</field>

Anyone visiting should also make note that flooding is a major problem in Hackensack (and many surrounding towns, especially in Southern Bergen).  Just 15 minutes of steady downpour will make some roads flood, and a few hours of steady rain will surely make many roads impassable, especially River Street.  If you can avoid driving while its raining or flooded, please do.  If not, try to use roads on higher ground towards Summit Avenue.</field>

		<field name="content">There is no easily accessed Taxi service in Cold Spring, but on the weekends you can take the train north one station to a stop which lets you out right at Breakneck, a popular mountain to hike up, especially in clear weather when you can look up and down the Hudson River. Any train will stop on its way south in the town of Garrison as well.  Also on the weekends is a Trolley that does a circuit a few times a day. To acquire some more information about it, visit the tourism information booth by the bathrooms on the East side of the train tracks. There is often a volunteer there from the Village Board. The ride is scenic and relaxed, reputedly only costing a dime. The stops are various points of interest in Cold Spring, the Garrison train station and Boscobel.  The most common way to get around is to walk. The country can be steep so leave yourself time. The Hudson Valley enjoys around 260 days of sunshine a year, usually more, so please hydrate appropriately! The cheapest water to be found is either free from the faucets in the always-open bathrooms down by the tracks (the water is reputedly from the Catskills and is the same that services the Schools water fountains) or for one-dollar at the Chinese Take-out, Ming Moon.</field>

		<field name="content">As in most American states, automobiles are the primary form of travel.  In larger cities you will find public bus systems, and Greyhound buses are an option for travel in between cities. There are also major airports in all large cities (Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and the Tri-Cities) and many smaller airports scattered across the state.   Unfortunately there is no option for rail travel to the central or eastern parts of the state.  However, Amtrak runs the fabled "City of New Orleans" line through Memphis and Newbern. This is certainly worth considering if you are planning to visit those areas, especially if you are heading along the Mississippi River. Also, the city of Nashville operates a commuter rail from the suburbs to the downtown area.</field>

		<field name="content">The visitor center and most other areas of interest to the casual visitor are in Frijoles Canyon, past the entrance station on good but steep paved road.  The road descends along the side of the canyon, with some exposure, and may be a bit intimidating to the motorist unused to mountain driving.  Parking at the bottom can be tight during peak periods, and it has gotten to the point that the park has closed Frijoles Canyon to automobiles from 9AM-3PM during the summer months; visitors are now required to take a shuttle bus from a visitor center in nearby White Rock during these hours.  Parking in a separate lot in Frijoles Canyon is available (and required) for backpackers planning on hiking into the backcountry from trailheads near the visitor center.  Some outlying areas (see under "Do" and "Get Out") are far enough from the visitor center to require driving to reach them.  The routes to the Tsankawi outlier and the cross-country ski trails are on good paved road (State Highway 4), although the road to the skiing can be snow-packed and hazardous during winter months.  Some of the backcountry trailheads are reached from St. Peters Dome Road, off State Highway 4 in the Jemez Mountains via a gravel forest road.  Passenger cars can negotiate the forest road, but a high-clearance vehicle may be desirable for reaching the trailheads. There is no shuttle service from the main monument sites to these areas.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">On Big Island, you need a car in order to get to most of the interesting beaches, parks or other attractions, or to travel from the  Kona  coast to the  Hilo  coast. Places like the green or black sand beaches, or the Mauna Kea summit and astronomical observatories are only accessible by four-wheel drive. Note that car rentals tend to book months in advance, depending on the season. If the major rental companies in  Kona  or  Hilo  are fully booked, you can still hope to find a used car to rent via Craigslist. These are older cars, most with dings or other cosmetic blemishes, but they dont make you look like a tourist.  If you only plan to stay around one town, you can also rent a moped or bike. See  Hawaii  for moped/scooter regulations.  Getting around by local bus, bikes, or on foot work well if youre staying in one area. Many budget travelers are unpleasantly surprised by the extremely limited public transport on the Big Island. The countys  Hele-On  bus is free, but the schedules are mainly intended for commuting. There are some bus companies offering excursions from Hilo to destinations like Volcano, but they require reservations.  Hitchhiking is extremely easy convenient on the Big Island.  As most places are near the Mamalahoa Highway, youre never too far from a good hitching spot.  As traffic generally flows from the Hilo side to resorts of Waikoloa Resorts in the morning, you can easily make it to the beaches without waking up at by 5:45 to catch the Hele-On bus.  As a large amount of locals take the spirit of Aloha seriously, hitching is the best way to travel for free throughout the Island.  Its not just the usual crowd of young people picking up hitchers either, Ive been picked up by families, grandmas, and even the mayor of Honokaa!  As a note, the district of Kau in the south of the island is very sparsely populated with low traffic levels, so hitching isnt near as good here as it is on the northern half of island.  If youre thinking about renting a Jeep, Alamo doesnt disable the four wheel drive option in their Jeeps as some other rental agencies do. However, keep in mind that you are violating the rental contract by driving on "unpaved roads" (let alone some of the four wheel drive only roads). As long as you are careful and sensible about it though, youll be fine. Just keep in mind that you are "on your own" if you get in trouble while violating the rental agreement. If youre going to violate the rental contract by driving on unpaved roads, you have less of a chance of getting stuck if you have the ability to shift to four wheel drive.   Harper Rentals  has four wheel drive vehicles that are allowed by contract to drive on unpaved roads. You will pay more for that right.</field>

This is not encouraged, because of safety issues, but is common, nonetheless.  Roseau is finishing a bike trail project that has been in the works for some time.  This bike trail will go around the edges of the city and into the beautiful city park.    Typically, a car is the best mode of transportation - there is no public transport available.  If youre in Roseau in the summertime, drive your car into Earls Drive In for an nostalgic meal.  More on this in the "Eat" section.</field>

		<field name="content">The first place you should stop in when you are in Annapolis is the   Visitors Center , 26 West Street, 888-302-2852, 9AM-5PM, Monday through Sunday, the official destination marketing organization of Annapolis Anne Arundel County. Come in for area maps, restroom, restaurant menus, and tours and tour schedule.  The most economic way of enjoying Annapolis would be getting around on foot. There are plenty of parking spaces available during less crowded times, such as during the winter months and weekdays after work hours. They are easy to find by following either the parking signs to a parking garage or looking around the harbor area for metered spots which can be held for up to two hours. Bicycles are also an option to bring along, but generally wouldnt be needed for a day of sightseeing in the harbor area.   Tourist maps are available at many downtown establishments, usually highlighting map sponsors as places to visit, but also including most places of interest as a not-to-scale reference. Any local Annapolitan would be more than happy to give short directions, or even a tip on where to eat.   During the busier times, a parking place will be a bit harder to find, but patience is usually rewarded. If needing extended transport, a bus line does traverse Annapolis at various locations. Though, the Annapolis Transit buses have a tendency to run off schedule and are often extremely early or extremely late; plan extra time if using the buses. Weekend nights, you will also find more than enough taxis available at the base of Main Street.</field>

Below are some alternatives to driving, but keep in mind that the boating and biking mentioned are mostly recreational activities, not the best way between points A and B. If youre arriving in Wilmington without a car, you will need to rent one, use cabs for the duration of your stay (which must be called ahead of time), or rely on the inadequate and infrequent coverage of the local bus network.</field>

		<field name="content">While there are many opportunities for hiking in the surrounding mountains, one of the best is local: the Glen Burney Trail.  This trail is about .1 mile off of Main Street, and is easily accessible.  Drivers should turn on to Laurel Lane, and then left after .1 mile into a parking lot on the left, labeled the Annie L. Cannon Memorial Gardens.  The trail begins at the end of the parking lot.    The trail goes about 1 1/2 miles down into a gorge, complete with views of several waterfalls.    Its common to assume that this is an easy trail because its so accessible.  This is a moderately strenuous trail, and hikers should be wary of dangers.  Hikers should stay on the trail.  Even on the trail, large sections are often slippery from wet leaves (especially during the fall of the year, if theres been plenty of rain) or dry leaves, which can be tricky, especially because hikers dont expect it.  Attempting to cross waterfalls is potentially life-threatening, and should never be attempted.  Hikers should also realize that cell phone service (in event of emergency) is spotty in the gorge.    But despite these warnings, this is a good trail, enjoyable, and do-able for most healthy adults.</field>

		<field name="name">get around</field>
		<field name="content">CTA trains route map   Navigating Chicago is easy. Block numbers are consistent across the whole city. Standard blocks, of 100 addresses each, are roughly 1/8th of a mile long. (Hence, a mile is equivalent to a street number difference of 800.) Each street is assigned a number based on its distance from the zero point of the address system, the intersection of State Street and Madison Street. A street with a W (west) or E (east) number runs east-west, while a street with a N (north) or S (south) number runs north-south. A streets number is usually written on street signs at intersections, below the street name. Major thoroughfares are at each mile (multiples of 800) and secondary arteries at the half-mile marks. Thus, Western Ave at 2400 W (3 miles west of State Street) is a north-south major thoroughfare, while Montrose Ave at 4400 N is an east-west secondary artery.  In general, "avenues" run north-south and "streets" run east-west, but there are numerous exceptions.  (e.g., 48th Street may then be followed by 48th Place). In conversation, however, Chicagoans rarely distinguish between streets, avenues, boulevards, etc.  Several streets follow diagonal or meandering paths through the city such as Clark St, Lincoln Ave, Broadway, Milwaukee Ave, Ogden Ave, Archer Ave, Vincennes Ave, and South Chicago Ave.</field>

Norfolk is in the process of building a starter light-rail line extending from the Newtown area at the Norfolk/Virginia Beach border to Downtown Norfolk and Sentara Hospital by the Midtown Tunnel.  The line is expected to be operational by May of 2011.  If you must drive around the city, a good map and/or a local with knowledge of the roads is an absolute necessity. Stay on interstates for as long as possible, for once you leave, any signage is the responsibility of the city, not VDOT, and it shows. If you directions tell you to follow US 58, US 460 or state route 337 through the city, be prepared for a nerve-wracking drive. Directional signage (i.e., US 460 east, turn left) is virtually non-existent, and what signage does exist is more often than not inadequate or even incorrect. If there is a difference between signage and a map, the map is correct. Routes can and do change direction and shoot off onto side streets at a moments notice, often without any signage advising travelers as to which road to follow. It is much easier than you might think to miss a turn and end up in a dangerous area.</field>

		<field name="content">Getting around Bensalem and Northeast Philadelphia is a bit more difficult than Center City: there are no subways or local train systems throughout Bensalem.  However, there is a SEPTA trainstation located at 700 Station Avenue, Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania 19020; which is nearby to Bristol Pike in the Bensalem Township area. Cornwells Heights is one of the largest ParkRide train facilities in the Philadelphia Area. The Trenton Line Regional Rail, the train which passes through Cornwells Heights, takes you to all of the major stops in Philadelphia, within walking distance of many major attractions in the inner city. Taking the train is less stressful and cheaper than driving in the inner city.   For train rides and ticket costs, please refer to the SEPTA Regional Rail website.     ----  However, if you choose to rent a car, there is more than one car rental facility in Bensalem.

		<field name="content">The Grand Valleys roads were originally designated by how many miles they were from the  Utah  border to the West. This "grid" was further defined by a North-South axis of roads demarcated by letters of the alphabet: A, B, C, etc. Unfortunately, the map collided with reality; the roads had to skirt a patchwork of fields and orchards. No one was willing to relinquish valuable arable land for orderly roads. The results are a bewildering amalgam of added fractions and decimals. Travelers may find themselves at F 3/4 Rd or D.50 Rd. The best answer is to grab a free map at one of the local Visitors Centers or Chambers of Commerce.  Travel by car, bike, or rent a limo or shuttle service.  Public transportation - There is a local bus system called  Grand Valley Transit .     Downtown Grand Junction  is a pedestrian mall, and easily navigated on foot. For the rest of the area, however, you will need a car or bike.</field>

Mile marker signposts are placed along Highway 58 every half-mile, and these are often used for giving directions.

		<field name="content">The Keys (at least the accessible, commercial islands) are connected by US Highway 1. A useful and interesting "quirk" about the linearity of the Keys (and US-1) is that directions to establishments and attractions are locally described by the "Mile Markers" along US-1.  If you ask someone how to get to a certain beach or hotel, they will tell you that it is at "Mile Marker 68.5"; many signs and brochures will say "MM 68.5" (of course, there is no mile marker 68.5, this just means that the hotel is halfway between mile markers 68 and 69).  These numbers start at zero at the start of US-1 on Key West, so the numbers get larger as you go north.  The speed limits in the Keys are generally 45 MPH on the built-up Islands, and 55 MPH on the bridges and less built-up islands.  There are areas (very built-up strips, or animal sanctuaries) where the speed drops to 35 MPH.</field>

Old school buses meet the Miller Boat Line ferries, which dock at the old lime kiln dock on the south side of the island.  The buses take travelers approximately 2 miles to Put-in-Bay, past the airport, for a small fee.  Cars are permitted on island roads, though speed limits are low and parking is VERY limited.  From mid-March to late-November you can get your car there from the mainland for $15 one-way on the Miller Boat Line (see listing above), located at the end of Route 53 on  Catawba Island .  Each person traveling with the vehicle also pays the normal fare of $6.50/person one-way.  Reservations are not required even on weekends, and vehicles are taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  Besides cars, they also take motorcycles, trailers, RVs, and other vehicles.  During heavier traffic periods, there can be restrictions on bringing your vehicle to or from Put-in-Bay.</field>

Although, especially at the center of town you will see many people walking or riding bikes, and there are plenty of sidewalks in that area to do so. Although a lot of the back roads dont have sidewalks, there are barely ever any cars on the back streets in Somers. Main Street goes right through Somers and that is the street that will give you access to most of the things that Somers has like restaurants, gas stations, car dealership, e.tc. Most of the back roads of Somers are just houses, farms, and fields.</field>

		<field name="content">Richmond is a small town not easily traveled without motor vehicle.  The small town of Richmond contains several villages, including: Arcadia, Alton, Carolina, Hope Valley, Kenyon, Shannock, Usquepaug, Woodville and Wyoming.  There is a park n ride across from the McDonalds on Rt. 138, and right off of 95, which RIPTA    operates.  The Three main roads that lead through Richmond are Rt. 138, Rt. 3 and Rt. 112.  Following 138 with either lead you west into Hopkinton or east to route 1 and South Kingstown.  Route 3 will bring you into Exeter and West Greenwich. Following 112 will lead you south in Charlestown  Easy Places to get to from Richmond, RI:  University Of Rhode Island   : Coming from 95 North, you must take exit 3A, and continue down 138 until it runs into URI.  The speed limit is 35 for most of the way and the troopers are unforgiving, especially to out-of-state drivers.     South Kingstown : Coming from 95 North again, you take exit 3A, and come down 138 until you reach South Kingstown.    Hopkinton: When driving through town, go west on 138, which leads you into Hopkinton.  You come to a three way stop-light, and continue going straight.  You will pass a little league baseball field on your left and that’s how you know you are going the correct way.   Westerly : Going into town, you can get onto 95 South from either side of the road which makes it easy to get to Westerly.  Get on 95 South until you get to Exit 1, which will lead you into Westerly.   Warwick : Getting to Warwick is just as easy, once you are on Main Street take 95 North, which will bring you to Providence, Warwick, and Massachusetts.  Route 95 is the easiest way to get around, and the main highway for the area.</field>

On foot/bike:While fun to walk around, Takoma Park is extremely hilly.  Some side streets go up a 50-ft incline in the space of a block.  Carroll Avenue (the main street) and Sligo Creek Park are the best opportunities for walking or biking.  The latter is a long-distance hiker-biker trail running parallel to the stream valley floor.  By bike, follow the 13th Street (Takoma) signed bike lane north of Downtown D.C. to Piney Branch Road and turn left on Cedar.  To get to the Sligo Creek hiker-biker trail, follow Carroll Avenue through the "Old Town" commercial district, or turn left on Maple Avenue for an easier and shorter distance.  Bus:Nearly all of the citys numerous bus lines terminate at the Silver Spring Metro station in downtown  Silver Spring , Maryland.</field>

		<field name="content">Buses (and bicycles) are the most effective means of traversing throughout New Brunswick. NJ Transit travels throughout the city. Rutgers University has buses that travel all around the campus, and you dont have to be a student to utilize them. Taxis are also prevalent (but relatively expensive), and the size of the town is such that walking is not out of the question.  Driving is also possible but parking is difficult to find in the downtown area and expensive. Most on-street parking in the downtown area is 2-hour only Monday-Friday, and parking garages tend to run about $1.50-$2 per hour. On-street regulations are suspended on the weekend but most spots are taken by residents. Some garages, such as the Lower Church Street garage, are free on Saturdays if you park before 5:00PM.  Traffic gets unbelievably stuck up after football games and Rutgersfest, with cars and buses often coming to a standstill on Route 18 and in neighboring Piscataway, as well as in downtown New Brunswick. So give yourself extra time on those occasions. Route 18 may also become jammed between the hours of 4 and 6 pm, due to rush hour traffic.</field>

Many hotels and BBs are located close enough to the center of town to make it an easy walk.  There are bike lanes downtown and extending outward from the downtown area, making this an easy town to bike around in.  Most days, the Rogue Valley Transportation District    operates buses running from one end of town to the other; these buses are $0.50 for riders remaining within Ashland ($2 for those going outside the city limits).  Be aware, however, the the buses run limited hours (5:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and do not run at all on weekends.</field>

		<field name="content">On Foot  South Burlington is not a very walkable city.  Although there are sidewalks, heavy traffic and long distances can make walking unpleasant or dangerous.  On a Bike  Some roads have bike lanes which makes cycling a viable option in some cases.  However, be aware that not all of the busier roads have bike lanes and are often narrower than in other parts of the  United States .  Much of Williston Road should be avoided by cyclists.  Public Transportation  South Burlington is served by several CCTA bus routes.  The routes serve Shelburne Road, Williston Road, the University Mall, and Burlington International Airport.  In a Car  A car is the easiest way to get around the city, although traffic can be frustrating at times.  Williston and Shelburne Roads should be avoided at rush hour.</field>
