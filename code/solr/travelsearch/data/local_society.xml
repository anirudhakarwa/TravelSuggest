		<field name="content">Northern Minnesota is a very conservative, Christian area.  Lutheranism, other Protestant denominations, and Catholicism are all practiced by large numbers of people.  Its a good idea to treat these beliefs respectfully.  Non-locals behaving in less-traditional ways are welcomed just as anyone else would be, but might attract attention or surprise.    Although most tourists will not notice the tensions between whites and Native Americans existent in the area, if you do, it is best not to comment publicly on them.  Do not engage in gossip about fights or scuffles regarding the two groups, which happen occasionally.  If you are interested in learning more about local events, activities, or culture, the Walker weekly newspaper, the Pilot-Independent, is an excellent and detailed resource.</field>
