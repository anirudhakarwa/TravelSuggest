		<field name="content">A somewhat impoverished, suburban community of garden apartments in Maryland near the Beltway,  Langley Park  is mostly identified with the International Corridorwhich extends into Takoma Park and  Silver Spring  on the east edge of town.  Most ethnic restaurants and grocery stores are located on  University Boulevard , a series of strip malls between Piney Branch Road and University of Maryland.  Piney Branch Road, on the border of Takoma Park and East Silver Spring, is more urban.  These areas are difficult to get to without a car (or bike).  Attractions in the area consist almost entirely of restaurants and grocery stores, because 90% of the businesses along the corridor are owned by immigrants.  Illuminated highway signs come in a mix of Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and Hindi.  El Salvadorean and Indian restaurants in this area are especially popular.    Restaurant and business listings for Takoma Park include establishments in the East Silver Spring / Langley Park area, some of which are within city limits.</field>
