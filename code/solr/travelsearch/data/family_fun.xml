Other museums in the area include: Midway Village and Museum Center, Tinker Swiss Cottage, Historic Auto Attractions, Erlander Home Museum and Ethnic Heritage Museum.  During the summer, Magic Waters Waterpark, operated by the Rockford Park District, offers families a fun way to cool down in the summer heat. The Rockford IceHogs    of the American Hockey League offer an excellent family entertainment option.</field>
