		<field name="content">Northampton is nationally known for being a bohemian college town and LGBT mecca. It is home to Smith College, a prestigious womens college. This small city of 30,000 is populated, mostly, by artists, intellectuals, political activists, hipsters, and a large LGBT community. Since abnormal is normal in Northampton, it is regarded as one of the most accepting places in the United States.  Long-time residents nickname Northampton "Hamp", while newer residents tend to call it "NoHo". Another nickname for Northampton is the "Paradise City", after Opera singer Jenny Lind remarked that Northampton was "The Paradise of America."  Northampton celebrated its 350th anniversary in 2004. The Town of Northampton (originally named Nonotuck) was granted its Charter in 1654; the City of Northampton was incorporated in 1884.  Liberal politics are an important part of Northamptons scene.  It is with good reason that Northampton was named the "Most liberal medium-size city in the country".   .</field>
