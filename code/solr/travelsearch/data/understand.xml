Congress again enacted a name change in 1929 to the name we now use, Acadia National Park.  It was the first NP established east of the Mississippi River.  In October 1947 Acadia, along with some adjacent lands, was ravaged by fire.</field>

		<field name="content">A quick look at any topographical map of  Mount Desert Island  will indicate the powerful and lasting effects of the last ice age on the island and the current landscape of Acadia.  As the last glacier receded over 18,000 years ago it left behind the elongated mountains and lakes we see today.  The moving ice was also the culprit behind the "bald" summits of most of the parks hilltops, scraping off vegetation and leaving the beautiful pink granite underneath.</field>

		<field name="content">Acadias weather is largely a product of latitude and marine influences. On a daily and annual basis, Mount Desert Island temperatures are more moderate than those of inland  Maine . The  Maine  coastal climate has been ranked second only to the Pacific Northwest in annual precipitation. This moisture occurs in every form at Acadia. Ice storms are regular in winter and early spring, and rain is frequent in every month. Fog is common during June, July, and August.  Spring can be foggy with temperatures ranging between 30 and 70 degrees F. Wear light-colored clothing, long sleeve shirts, and long pants for protection. Annual rainfall is 48 inches.  Summer daytime temperatures range from 45 to 90 degrees F. Evenings are cooler. Dressing in layers is advisable for any boating or hiking activities. Ocean water temperatures range from 50 to 60 degrees F. Lake water temperatures range from 55 to 70 degrees F.  Fall temperatures can range from low 70s during the day to freezing during the night. Come prepared for all types of weather, from sun to fog, from downpours to flurries. Fall foliage often peaks during the first couple of weeks in October. Weather conditions over the summer, such as drought, may alter the time that the leaves peak.  In the winter, due to Acadias coastal location, snow and weather conditions change rapidly. Temperatures vary from mid-30s to below zero. The park averages 61 inches of snow annually. For the latest in weather information, call the local weather phone line at 207-667-8910 or call the park at 207-288-3338.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Albuquerque was founded in 1706 as a small Spanish settlement on the banks of the Rio Grande and was named for the Duke of Alburquerque (hence Albuquerques nickname, "The Duke City"). In the 1880s the railroad came to town, and almost overnight a new city grew up around the train tracks a couple of miles away from the original settlement. This "New Town" became the hub of commerce for the state, and the city grew exponentially (eventually the "New Town", which today is Downtown, and the original "Old Town" settlement were joined to become part of the same city).   In the 1920s the federal government officially recognized a series of highways that ran from  Chicago  to  Los Angeles  as  Route 66 , and Albuquerque was one of the towns "The Mother Road" passed through. Starting in the 1950s, Albuquerque grew exponentially given federal investment in the local military bases and a massive influx of visitors and new residents, and for the most part it hasnt slowed down. Today, Albuquerque is still the hub of commerce and transportation in the state. While Santa Fe is the state capital and the principal tourist destination of New Mexico, Albuquerque is the states only truly urban area, with a city population of over 500,000 and a metropolitan population of nearly a million people. This is where youll find the headquarters of the states businesses, the University of New Mexico, and the Albuquerque International Sunport, the only major airport in the state.</field>

		<field name="content">Albuquerque is in the high desert  −106.64W (Elev. 4989nbsp;ft/1521 m)  and has a generally warm, dry climate with four distinct seasons. Spring is sunny and windy, although temperatures at night can be unexpectedly cool. Summers are hot (highs average 90–95°F/34°C, and temperatures near 100°F/38°C are not rare) and still mainly dry, but monsoonal conditions develop in July or August and produce furious if short-lived thunderstorms. Have rainwear available in the summer, although you wont use it most days. Fall is delightful, with comfortable temperatures and a return to generally dry conditions. Winter can be blustery, with overnight lows below freezing, but subzero temperatures are rare. One winter-weather issue for the traveler: snow, while infrequent and short-lived, does occur, and its relative rarity means that local drivers dont deal with it well. If you happen to be in town for a snowstorm, expect road chaos far out of proportion to the amount of snow that falls.</field>

		<field name="content">Albuquerque is a casual town—expect shorts, a T-shirt, and sandals to be entirely acceptable almost everywhere.  While Albuquerque does have a large non-native population, it is predominantly white, Hispanic, and American Indian.  Albuquerque is also something of a self-deprecating town; long-time natives here may often remark on how backward, dusty, and small it is, which is something that is frequently rebuked with a passion from many newcomers.  However, the wonderful upside of this self-deprecation is that Albuquerque is generally a rather humble city, where people tend to be very friendly.</field>

Views of the foliage can be seen from the surrounding mountains, the hiking trails, and throughout the college campuses. During this time tourists also come to take part in agricultural activities such as apple picking, farmers markets, and hay rides. The town is usually bustling with college students during the season, making the town congested and sometimes crowded. Although, the students add to the youthful atmosphere of the town and make it lively and energetic.</field>

		<field name="content">Huntington settlers first visited the Amityville area in 1653 as a source of salt hay. Chief Wyandanch granted the first deed to land in Amityville in 1658.  The area was originally called Huntington West Neck South (it is on the Great South Bay and Suffolk County, New York border in the southwest corner of what once called Huntington South but is now the Town of Babylon. According to village lore, the name was changed in 1846 when residents met to find a better name for its new post office. The meeting turned into bedlam and one participant was to exclaim, ``What this meeting needs is some amity." Another version says the name was first suggested by mill owner Samuel Ireland to name the town for his boat the Amity.  The place name is strictly speaking an incident name, marking an amicable agreement on the choice of a place name.  In the early 1900s Amityville was a popular tourist destination with large hotels on the bay and large homes.  Annie Oakley was said to be a frequent guest of vaudevillian Fred Stone. Will Rogers had a home across Clocks Boulevard from Stone. Gangster Al Capone also had a house in the community.</field>

Many people consider the period between May and early September to be the best time to visit Anchorage. The month of June usually has the best combination of long days, good weather, and warm afternoons.  As you would expect in the high northern latitudes, the longest days come around the summer solstice, 21 June, and they get quite short around the winter solstice, 21 December.  In the summer, Anchorage gets 19.5 hours of sunlight. At the start of winter, Anchorage gets about 5 hours of sunlight each day. By mid-February, the days begin to feel noticeably longer.  The Anchorage-area climate, including the Kenai Peninsula and Prince William Sound, often sees summer temperatures in the mid-70s (24°C). Winter temperatures may fall into the -20s and -30s (-30s°C) for a short spell.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The region was dominated by a longleaf pine and wiregrass ecosystem, similar in the coastal plain of the United States. The original old-growth forest had trees 90–120 feet tall, many of which were 120 to 250 years old, along with dense groves of younger tall saplings. The old-growth forest was cut between 1880 and the early 1900s for lumber. Many of the remaining pine trees were tapped for gum, which was distilled for turpentine and rosin.  In the mid-1930s the USDA Forest Service bought large areas of these damaged cutover lands. One such area became the Apalachicola National Forest in 1936.  The mission of the Forest Service was conservation, to care for the land and assure that it would be used to serve the public. During and after World War II demand was great for timber, and the availability of heavy equipment allowed extensive harvest in this and other national forests.  Clearcut areas were prepared and replanted with slash pine.  The older pine trees have regenerated naturally from stands cut between 1900 and 1935, but about 25% of the acreage that was originally native longleaf is now in slash pine plantations (58,000 acres). In 1992, Forest Service policy shifted away from clearcutting to one of promoting ecosystem health and sustainability.   The current policies for the Apalachicola National Forest are spelled out in legislation:   Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act 1960   Wilderness Act of 1964   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969   Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973   National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976   Revised Land and Resource Management Plan for National Forests in Florida 1999</field>

		<field name="content">The generally flat terrain of the forest is pocked by bays, sinkholes, and swamps. Some soils are excessively drained, others poorly drained.  The largest area of natural forest is dominated by longleaf pine and slash pine with an understory of palmetto, gallberry, and wiregrass.  The Munson Sandhills just south of Tallahassee have turkey oak and bluejack oak, species favored by the deep well-drained sandy soil, as well as pine.   The geological sinks in the area are surrounded by mesic hardwood forests. The Apalachicola Savannas in the southwestern section of the forest have longleaf pine on their sandy ridges but also include large treeless concave areas with a highly diverse wetland herbaceous community.  The forest includes many seepage bogs and numerous bay, cypress, gum, and titi swamps, where black gum, red maple, and wax myrtle are common.</field>

The endangered animals are the gray bat, red-cockaded woodpecker, wood stork, and four mollusks. The endangered plant is Harper’s beauty.  Threatened species included five animals and three plants.  The animals are the bald eagle, the eastern indigo snake, the flatwoods salamander, the Gulf sturgeon and the purple bankclimber mussel.  The threatened plants are white birds-in-a-nest, Godfrey’s butterwort, and the Florida skullcap.  The Forest Service monitors these species plus an additional set (like the black bear and the gopher tortoise) whose population viability is plants and considered to be sensitive.  Alligators are present in this forest. They are an important part of Florida’s ecology and may be found wherever there is a body of water. They have a natural fear of man, but may lose that fear by being around people especially if they are fed. When this happens alligators can be dangerous. For this reason alligators should not be fed or molested in any way.</field>

		<field name="content">The draconian weather is definitely not one of the attractions in Apple Valley. Theres a boat load of fun to be had in any season, but it is a place where the climate has to be taken into consideration.  Obscured by  Minnesota ’s ferocious winters are the heat waves of summer. Many days in July and August are disgustingly hot and humid. Summer nights are more comfortable, though, and youll get a few degrees respite along one of the many lakefronts — in the local parlance, thats "cooler by the lake,"   .  But then there are those winters. The months from November to March will see very cold temperatures, with even more bitter wind chill factors. Blizzards and ice storms are a regular occurrence. Its a city thats well-accustomed to these winters, though, so city services and public transportation are highly unlikely to shut down.  Apple Valley does have a few nice months of weather. May and September are pleasant and mild; April and June are mostly fine, although thunderstorms with heavy winds can also occur suddenly. Even though there may be a chill in the air in October, it rarely calls for more than a light coat.</field>

		<field name="content">Apple Valley is called the City of Fruits and Labor but was formerly known as the Cider Capital of the World, and before that, as the original home of Johnny Appleseed, and before that, as a regional grain milling outpost. It’s difficult to put a finger on exactly what made the city grow, but residents and travelers alike are happy with the results.  Apple Valley’s history (or herstory, as many local feminist groups have come to call it) is shrouded in ambiguity. Some claim the first developers came from the small fishing community of Apple Valley, CA and named their new plot of land thusly. This is a misconception, as it is considered common knowledge that no one would move to Minnesota from California. The more widely held belief is that the infant community was named for local housing developments in which an apple tree was planted on every lot. Some of these apple trees can still be seen in the Old Town neighborhood.  Apple Valley has 48 parks with 60 miles of trails. The community is carefully planned to enhance the quality of life of residents and travelers alike. Minnesota, known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" and whose motto encourages all to "Explore Minnesota," is the official state of Apple Valley. The city created a concentrated area of office space within its "Ring Route", which surrounds downtown. Mixed office, retail and residential assets can be found in Harmony Commons in downtown. The business parks; Valley Business Park, Knob Ridge Business Park and the Apple Valley Business Park feature many corporations. This is part of Apple Valleys comprehensive plan for growth and development and its aspirations to be an Alpha World City ++. Jim Bunyan, Paul’s brother, is a favorite city folk hero. He is an accountant.</field>

Its also banned within fifteen feet of any entrance, window, or exit to a public place, and at MVTA bus stations. The fine for violating the ban can range from $100 to public shaming.  There are several hookah bars and basements where smoking (tobacco) is legal and acceptable. These are great places to stage a picture of you and your friends blowing smoke rings. It is advisable for travelers to avoid "throwing up a sign" in these poses. Doing so may harm your self-respect.</field>

		<field name="content">Throughout the park, rock layers reveal millions of years of deposition, erosion and other geologic events. These layers continue to shape life in Arches today, as their erosion influences elemental features like soil chemistry and where water flows when it rains.  Arches is in a "high desert," with elevations ranging from 4,085 to 5,653 feet above sea level.  In 1923 Alexander Ringhoffer, a prospector, wrote the Rio Grande Western Railroad in an effort to publicize the area and gain support for creating a national park. Ringhoffer led railroad executives interested in attracting more rail passengers into the formations; they were impressed, and the campaign began. The government sent research teams to investigate and gather evidence. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed the legislation creating Arches National Monument, to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations. In 1971 Congress changed the status of Arches to a National Park, recognizing over 10,000 years of cultural history that flourished in this now famous landscape of sandstone arches and canyons.</field>

		<field name="content">To many, the most outstanding natural features of Arches are the parks geologic formations. Over 2,000 catalogued arches range in size from a three-foot opening (the minimum considered to be an arch), to Landscape Arch which measures 306 feet from base to base. Towering spires, fins and balanced rocks complement the arches, creating a remarkable assortment of landforms in a relatively small area.  Two unusual natural features common in Arches intrigue both scientists and visitors: cryptobiotic soil and potholes. Cryptobiotic soil is a living groundcover that forms the foundation of high desert plant life.  Potholes are naturally occurring basins or pools in sandstone that collect rainwater and wind-blown sediment. These potholes harbor organisms that are able to survive long periods of dehydration, and also serve as a breeding ground for many desert amphibians and insects. Both of these communities are very vulnerable to human impacts.</field>

		<field name="content">The plants and animals in Arches have many adaptations that enable them to survive these conditions. Some species are found only in this area. The diversity of organisms reflects the variety of available habitat, which includes lush riparian areas, ephemeral pools, dry arroyos, mixed grasslands and large expanses of bare rock.   Generally, the trees of Arches grow small and far away from each other. However, mixed stands of Pinyon pine and Utah Juniper, two trees that thrive in dry, rocky environments, can be found throughout the park. In Arches, there is more tree diversity in riparian environments where there is plenty of water. In such locales, trees such as netleaf hackberry, box elder, and Fremonts cottonwood can be found. Nine species of cacti can be found in the park, as well as many types of desert wildflowers and shrubs.    A lizard basks on a rock in the Devils Garden.   Nearly 50 species of mammals can be found in Arches National Park. Among the more commonly sighted mammals are mule deer, desert bighorn sheep, desert cottontail rabbit, and kangaroo rat. Other large mammals, such as the mountain lion, are present but rarely spotted.   Although Arches National Park is not a birding hot spot, 273 species of birds have been spotted in the park. Species such as  Spotted Towhee and Canyon Wren can be found near water in spring and summer. In drier grasslands and pinyon-juniper woodlands of the park, Says Phoebe, Black-throated Sparrow, Western Meadowlark, Juniper Titmouse, Pinyon and Scrub Jays, and Lucys and Black-throated Gray Warblers are present. Common Raven will likely be seen by nearly all visitors, and can be spotted throughout the park. Coopers Hawk and Turkey Vulture are among the birds of prey that glide above Arches desert landscape.   Arches is home to many reptiles as well. These include 10 species of lizards and 9 types of snakes. Venomous rattlesnakes are present, but are reluctant to attack, so use common sense and caution when observing them.</field>

Summer temperatures often exceed 100°F (38°C), making strenuous exercise difficult. Late summer monsoon season brings violent storm cells which often cause flash floods.  Winters are cold, with highs averaging 30 to 50°F (-1°C to +10°C), and lows averaging 0 to 20°F (-18 to -7°C). Though large snowfalls are uncommon (except in nearby mountains), even small amounts of snow or ice can make local trails and roads impassable.

		<field name="content">Grand Canyon National Park   Arizona covers 113,909 square miles, with about 350 square miles of water surface including Lake Havasu, Lake Powell, Lake Mead and the Colorado River. The state consists of three primary topographical features: a high plateau in the northeast of the state, averaging between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation; a mountainous region which runs from the southeast to the northwest with peak elevations between 9,000 and 12,000 feet; and low mountain ranges and desert valleys in the southwestern of the state.  The state is defined by the  Grand Canyon  in the north, the Mogollon (pronounced MUG-ee-own) Rim in the central mountainous region and the Sonoran Desert to the south.  Scattered among these regions, features such as the red rocks of  Sedona , the tall, wind-swept towers of  Monument Valley  and the saguaro-filled desert valleys around  Phoenix  and  Tucson  add depth and character to the landscape of Arizona.  Another prominent feature of the Arizona landscape, a Ponderosa Pine forest stretches across the state from the White Mountain region around Greer and Alpine across the Mogollon Rim to the San Francisco Peaks north of Flagstaff.  This strip of pine also extends beyond the Grand Canyon onto the Kaibab Plateau and into Southern Utah.  Humphreys Peak, part of the San Francisco Peaks, is the highest point in Arizona with an elevation of 12,611 feet. Baldy Peak, located  in the White Mountains, is the second highest point with an elevation of 11,490 feet. In the southwest of the state, the Sonoran Desert stretches out of Mexico and into Arizona with elevations as low as about 100 feet above sea level in the Lower Colorado River Valley.</field>

		<field name="content">Rainfall in Arizona is primarily determined by season and elevation. In the mountainous region, that runs from the southeast to the northwest, rainfall amounts will average between 25 and 30 inches (including melted snow) annually, while the low-lying desert region averages only three or four inches annually. The high plateau region in the northeast of the state averages 10 inches of rainfall annually.  During winter months, November through March, storms occur regularly at the higher elevations in central and northern Arizona and can produce heavy snowfall. Summer months, particularly early July through mid-September, bring the monsoon season to the desert region. Monsoons are strong thunderstorms, typically lasting a short time in certain area, that produce powerful winds and brief periods of blowing dust prior to the storms arrival. Almost all of these storms occur roughly between mid-afternoon and the middle of the night.  The average number of days with measurable rainfall per year ranges from around 70 in the northern part of the state to 15 in the desert regions. The air is usually dry and clear, with low relative humidity and a high percentage of sunshine. April, May and June usually produce the most clear days, while July and August (in lower elevations), as well as December, January and February (in higher elevations) have the cloudiest weather due to thunderstorms. Humidity, is low in comparison to other states, however it is typically higher during the monsoon season.  Despite the common perception of Arizona as a warm state, snowfall does occur annually in high altitude areas such as  Flagstaff .</field>

Photography and painting may not be allowed.  Check with the individual tribe before taking photographs.  Dances are typically part of religious ceremonies. Think of these events as you would if you were visiting a holy site, such as a church.  Also, be mindful that applause may not be welcome after a dance.  Do not climb walls or structures.  Sacred areas and graveyards are not usually open to visitors.  Reservations and villages should be treated with respect.  While most reservations are open to visitors, individual homes are private and should be entered only by invitation.  Some arts and crafts sold around reservations may not be authentic.

This habitat is home to migratory birds, plants, and of course wild ponies. There are many different theories to how the ponies got to the island; some say  they are survivors of a shipwreck, but there is no evidence to support this. Others say that someone put the ponies over on the island so that they could avoid fencing laws.</field>

		<field name="content">More than half of Assateague Island National Seashore’s 48,000 acres is comprised of near-shore and estuarine waters, and the interplay between these waters and the barrier island affects nearly every aspect of life in this dynamic coastal environment.   The geography of the island itself is in a state of constant flux, continuously being reshaped by the elemental forces of wind and water.  Powerful storms can dramatically alter the shoreline in a matter of hours, as waves wash over the beach and reshape the island from ocean to bay.  Other forces sculpt the landscape in less obvious ways.  Exposure to salt spray, lack of fresh water, and isolation from the mainland are subtle, but powerful influences on the Island’s species composition.  Over time, these conditions have produced a community of plants and animals uniquely suited to the extremes found at the edge of the sea.</field>

While Assateague’s wild horses are perhaps the island’s best-known inhabitants, other large mammals also roam the park, including the native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and the non-native sika deer (Cervus japonica), a diminutive species of Asian elk introduced to Assateague during the 1920’s.  Other inhabitants are less conspicuous than the large mammals.  Seven species of frogs and toads depend on fresh water ponds in the center of the island for breeding, and a variety of snakes, such as the black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), can be found across the forests, dunes, and marshes preying on rodents, small birds, or toads.   Numerous invertebrates such as fiddler crabs (Uca ssp.) and mud snails (Nassarius ssp.) play key roles in maintaining the health of the island’s salt marshes.  Even the seemingly barren beaches provide habitat for nocturnal ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and raccoons (Procyon lotor), who scavenge the crustaceans, fish, and other organic matter washed in by the tides.  Many bird species make their home on Assateague on a seasonal basis.  Shorebirds by the tens of thousands depend upon the island’s protected foraging and resting areas during their twice-yearly transcontinental migrations.  Each fall, large flocks of waterfowl such as snow geese (Chen caerulescens) begin arriving at Assateague where they will spend the winter traveling between the sheltered bay and salt marshes and fallow farm fields on the mainland.  Finally, the coastal waters that surround Assateague Island teem with animal life.  The sheltered, nutrient rich waters of the estuary formed by the island provide ideal breeding and spawning habitat for many aquatic species, some of which, like the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), are commercially important to the local area.  Each spring a variety of fish, including spot (Leiostomus xanthrurus), Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) migrate into the estuary to breed.  Later, the juvenile fish provide an abundant food source for birds, marine mammals, and larger fish.</field>

The city is thus somewhat cooler than other places in the US South, a fact that certainly helped the growth of the city before the introduction of air conditioning.  Atlanta experiences a very wide range of temperatures. Temperatures in winter are overall mild to warm, but cold-fronts can bring light accumulations of snow and lows occasionally plummet into the teens.  However, days are usually in the 50s and nights in the low to mid 30s. Ice-storms are very rare, but not unheard of. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures frequently reaching above 90°F (32°C), thus the city earning the nickname "Hotlanta". Rainfall is high in late winter and early spring, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit.  The region is often affected during hurricane season (June 1 to November 30) from remnants that spill out from the Gulf, bringing heavy rains and sometimes high winds.</field>

		<field name="content">Atlanta began taking substantive shape in 1837 when the Western Atlantic Railroad selected the site as the Southern end of its tracks. The town was called Terminus until 1843 when it was renamed Marthasville after the daughter of Gov. Wilson Lumpkin. In 1847, the city was renamed Atlanta, supposedly a feminine form of "Atlantic" probably created by an engineer with the Western Atlantic. The city was incorporated in 1847.  By the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Atlanta was a major railroad hub, manufacturing center, and supply depot. But, in 1864, in order to cripple transportation between the South and the North, Union General William T. Shermans army burned all of the railroad facilities, almost every business and more than two-thirds of the citys homes to the ground during his infamous "March to the Sea." Atlanta lay in ruins, the only major American city ever destroyed by war.  Atlantas first resurgence began soon after. Within four years of Shermans attack, the Georgia capital was moved from Milledgeville to Atlanta and a drive to attract new business was underway. In the meantime, college and universities began to open, telephones were introduced, and trolleys began to roll. In 1895, the Cotton States and International Exposition in Piedmont Park showed 800,000 visitors and residents that Atlanta was headed in a new direction and braced for the 20th century.  By the late 1920s, a downtown business sector had taken shape, giving Atlanta much of the distinct pattern it maintains today. At the same time, Atlanta Alderman (and later Mayor) William B. Hartsfield campaigned long and hard to convince the city to turn a vacant racetrack into an airport. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the worlds busiest airport, with more than 80 million annual passengers.  While the city continued its economic surge, it also became known as the "City Too Busy to Hate." Atlanta and Georgia preempted much of the strife associated with the 1950s and 60s by taking the lead in the Southeast in strengthening minority rights. The citys strongest identification with the movement was through its native son, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Much has been accomplished in the last 25 years to elevate Atlanta to world-class status. An efficient public transportation system, MARTA, was put in place; Underground Atlanta was added to the entertainment map; the Georgia World Congress Center made the city a convention hub; the Georgia Dome was built in 1992; and Philips Arena was built in 1999.  From July 20 through August 4, 1996, all eyes were on Atlanta as it hosted the Centennial Olympic Games. The city successfully hosted the biggest Olympic Games ever, showcasing itself to 2 million people in person and 3.5 billion people through global broadcast.  The Olympics served as a catalyst for a second resurgence of Atlanta as it experiences a dramatic transformation from great American city to greater international city by fueling more than $6 billion in development and changes.  Most recently, Atlanta has become a major conference and convention destination, due mostly to the enormous airport and favorable weather. Most of the conference venues are located around the Peachtree Center MARTA station in downtown, and when there is a large show in town, it can sometimes seem as though every other person in the city is wearing a name tag.</field>

Steeped in Confederate politics, a struggle for survival, and unavoidable love intrigues, this film has the rare distinction of being as good as if not better than the classic southern book it is based on. Driving Miss Daisy (Bruce Beresford, 1989). This film tactfully explores the racial issues of the civil rights-era through the nuances of a relationship between a wealthy white woman and her black chauffeur. ATL (Chris Robinson, 2006). A coming of age drama set in the hip-hop culture of the modern city.  Atlanta is also the background for the popular television show "The Walking Dead".</field>

		<field name="content">From its founding, Atlantic City has always been about tourism.  It was founded in the late 19th century as a resort destination after railroad companies built track between Absecon Island (on which the city exists today) and  Philadelphia . In its early days, Atlantic City catered to urban workers from Philadelphia. The heyday for Atlantic City as a beach resort lasted through the first half of the 20th century, when it fell out of favor. Atlantic City was revived after a state-wide referendum in 1976 legalized casino gambling in the city, and casinos began popping up along the boardwalk and in the Marina District in 1978.</field>

		<field name="content">Austin weather is generally nice most of the year; activities are generally not limited by season. However, as Austin lies within Central Texas, be prepared to deal with the long, hot summers if you are visiting between May and September. It is not uncommon for daily high temperatures to be between 90 and 100 degrees during this time — in fact, a day in the 80s is rare, and several days may even reach triple digits (90 days in 2011). If you are here when the weather is like this, dress accordingly, drink plenty of water, and do not plan on staying outside for long (nearly all indoor places are air-conditioned) — unless youre taking the opportunity to take a dip in Barton Springs Pool or any of the other swimming holes in the area. This is especially true if the heat index is around 105 or higher, which is considered to be dangerous. Also keep in mind that the interior of cars will get dangerously hot, especially if the windows are up and its parked in the sun — dont leave pets or children in there, no matter how brief. How hot the summer gets usually depends on the amount of precipitation the area has been getting. If there is no drought and the spring has been particularly wet, temperatures will remain relatively tolerable and rarely break triple digits.  If it has been dry, as it was from 2007-2009, summers can be very uncomfortable and triple-digit temps will be very common.  Central Texas winters are short to non-existent. There are many pleasant or even warm days during the winter months (the first 90 degree day of 2012 was in February), and snowfall is rare.  However, hard freezes happen occasionally, and light freezes may occur frequently (especially in the more rural areas), and when this mixes with precipitation, ice storms and other wintry weather happen. If the storm is severe enough, the city may shut down for a day or so, traffic may be snarled, and the local auto body shops may receive a spike in business. The Austin area usually experiences such events 0-2 times each year or so, from late December to mid-February. Generally, though, winter weather just varies a lot, with alternating cold and warm fronts that can make for large temperature swings within just a weeks time.  Spring and fall are the best times to visit. Springs tend to be stormy (see "Stay safe" for related warning), and falls may bring light freezes during the night. For the most part, though, springs and falls are very pleasant times to experience Austin.</field>

		<field name="content">During the youth of the  Rocky Mountains , about 60 million years ago, large number of streams carried eroded soil, rock and other materials eastward from the range. These materials were deposited on the vast lowlands which are today called the  Great Plains . Dense vegetation grew in these lowlands, then fell into swamps, and was later buried by new layers of sediments. Millions of years later, this plant material turned into lignite coal. Some of the plant life became petrified, and we can find large amounts of exposed petrified wood in the badlands. While sediments continued to be deposited, more streams cut down through the soft rock layers, carving the variety of mesas, buttes, rock formations, pinnacles, spires and valleys are the features of the badlands seen today.</field>

		<field name="content">For eleven thousand years humans used the area for hunting. They hunted bison, rabbits, and other animals.  Fossils hunters arrived after the 1840s. Trappers traveling from Fort Pierre to Fort Laramie collected fossils. One fossil ended up being described in the American Journal of Science. Within decades new species were being discovered.  Homesteaders arrived at the end of the 19th century and the US government removed the natives from their land. This culminated in the massacre at  Wounded Knee , which is approximately 45 miles south of the park in the Pine Ridge Reservation.  The Dust Bowl of the 1930s prompted many homesteaders to move elsewhere. Some who stayed are still there today.  The United States Air Force took possession of more than 340,000 acres of the Pine Ridge Reservation and about 340 acres of what was then Badlands National Monument and used it extensively between 1942 and 1945 as a gunnery range. This is now the Stronghold unit of the park and is co-managed with the Oglala Sioux Tribe. Unexploded ordnance remains in the area.</field>

The minimal annual precipitation feeds the grasses and wildflowers of the badlands. The brilliant colors of the blooms add to the palette of grays, browns, reds, ochres and greens of the land. The wildlife includes nearly two hundred species of birds, (mule and white tail) deer, prairie dogs, pronghorn, big horn sheep, and bison. Other mammals in the park include bats, rabbits, and coyotes. The park has reintroduced the black footed ferret, the most endangered land mammal in North America, to the Sage Creek Wilderness area. Reptiles and amphibians include frogs, toads, and snakes.</field>

High temperatures around 40°F (4.4°C) with lows below 0°F (-18°C) and high winds creating much lower windchill. Snow is likely and blizzards are possible.  March is difficult. Temperatures may fluctuate dramatically within a few hours. Blizzards are still possible, and so is 60°F (15.5°C) weather.  Spring begins in April. With snow melting and April rains, the park is very wet. The unpaved roads can be difficult or impossible to pass and trails may be slippery and unpleasant. Temperatures at night is typically below freezing. The park receives most of its rain between April and June. Showers may be brief or last for days.  July is hot and dry. Daytime temperatures can surpass 90°F (32°C).  August is the hottest when temperatures can break 100°F (38°C). Evenings are about 75°F (24°C).  In September the temperatures begin to cool off in the second half of the month.  October is much cooler although a few days may break 80°F (27°C).</field>

Bainbridge Island is a predominantly white, highly-educated, and - as a by-product of isolated island life -  culturally and socially sheltered community. The island was once a poets commune in the 70s and 80s, when many West-Coast artists, poets, and musicians converged to bask in the islands serene environment. Artistic and cultural events and organizations still abound, at perennial Pegasus Coffee, The Harbour Pub, The Lynwood Theatre, and The Bainbridge Performing Arts Center, which has its own improv comedy troupe. There is a refreshing 40s+ alternative scene involving yoga, martial arts, and social activism. The island is becoming increasingly gentrified, with many retirees settling down, particularly since it was voted the 2 place to live by Money Magazine in 2005.</field>

		<field name="content">Baltimore has a very long and rich history. It is perhaps most well known for being the site of the historic Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Over the course of the battle, British invaders bombed Fort McHenry with rockets as Francis Scott Key wrote what would become the American national anthem. Baltimore was also the site of the first casualty of the American Civil War.  It also has a large African-American population that has played an important role in its history. African Americans have had a major presence in Baltimore since the Revolutionary War. During that time they were brought to Baltimore as slaves from Africa. Baltimore was also one of the hotbeds during the American Civil Rights movement and famous African-Americans such as Thurgood Marshall and Kweisi Mfume have made Baltimore their hometown. RB artists such as Tupac, Dru Hill and Mario have also emerged from Baltimore. Currently, African-Americans form a majority (within the city limits) at 64%.</field>

		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">Baltimore lies within the humid subtropical climate zone, and weather is primarily affected by three factors: its proximity to a warm marine estuary, its low elevation, and the wall of mountains to the west and northwest.  These factors make the areas climate milder and less extreme than other U.S. cities at this latitude. Summers are humid and hot, but not extremely so, with highs reaching the high 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit and lows in the 60s to low 70s. Winters are cold to mild and moist, with highs in the upper 40s to low 50s, and lows in the 30s and 40s. It is almost never below 10°F in the city proper. Light snow can sometimes fall in winter, although some years there is no significant accumulation and once every few years a coastal storm can dump 8 inches to a foot of snow on the city. Spring and fall bring pleasant temperatures in the 50s-70s(°F), and southern breezes.  While weather in the region can vary, Baltimore does not experience the extremes of weather change that occur further north and inland.  Visitors will be able to venture outdoors without a jacket from approximately mid-March to late November.  The hot humid summers invite the wearing of shorts on many days.  The Baltimore area experiences pleasant fall foliage, usually beginning in mid October and ending in early December.  The long warm weather season means that swimming pools are very popular for much of the year as well.</field>

		<field name="name">film</field>
		<field name="content">Baltimore boasts a surprisingly influential, albeit small-scale, film industry. Self-dubbed the "grandfather of filth" native John Waters is the Baltimore equivalent of  New Yorks  Woody Allenmdash;he has directed movie after movie, set and filmed on location in Baltimore, drawing heavily for inspiration from Baltimores most bizarre subcultures and its strangest neighborhoods. He became famous for his "gore" flicks in the 1970s, which combine the single-minded purpose of grossing-out (or perhaps scarring-for-life) the viewers along with intensely bad acting, outrageous Baltimore accents, subversive humor, general trashy perversion and violence, and one enormous Baltimore drag queen named Divine. Of this era, Pink Flamingos achieved a certain cult-classic status, although it is absolutely not for the faint of heart (or the pure of spirit).   Hampden  ]]  Waters films post-1970s mellowed out dramatically, albeit still maintaining his signature interest in subversive campiness, culminating in his most famous work, Hairspray, a 1962-fabulous story of a plus-size girl with plus-size hair who wanted to bring a black boy to the locally-televised dance show against the forces of racial segregation and bigotry. He has gained considerable success within the  Manhattan  art world for his more recent work across all sorts of mediumsmdash;but he rails against that same art world in Pecker, a movie soaked in the local colors of Baltimores Hampden neighborhood. His dogged loyalty to his city has earned him a lot of goodwill here. A recent mayor proposed creating a local John Waters holiday, and the Hampden neighborhood erected a giant pink flamingo statue up on the main street. But dont let all this lull you into a sense of complacencymdash;unless its Hairspray or perhaps Crybaby and maybe Serial Mom, dont show his films to your kids!  Barry Levinson, is perhaps the most well-known film maker to come out of and make films about Baltimore. His directing career began with Diner, a movie set in the Baltimore of his youth, and a movie that would begin the famous four-movie series of "Baltimore films" along with Tin Men, Avalon, and Liberty Heights.  Another big name in Baltimore film-making is undoubtedly David Simon, famous for his Baltimore-centric crime dramas Homicide: Life on the Street (which he co-produced with Barry Levinson), and, of course, The Wire, which has been called by nearly every major journalistic publication in the English language "the best show on television"mdash;although several have contended this doesnt go far enough, calling it the best TV series of all time. The Wire is set principally in the most blighted neighborhoods of West Baltimore, dealing with startlingly realistic, cliché-less portrayals of the life of the citys (and Americas) underclass and the drug crime that pervades the neighborhoods and housing projects that underclass lives in. A veteran reporter for the Baltimore Sun and a novelist in his own right, Simon also turns his camera on the city government, the police department, and the public schools, and never in too favorable of a light. (If you are a fan of the series, check out  The Wire Tour !) For an even starker portrayal of life and drugs in Baltimores most blighted neighborhoods, check out his documentary-style miniseries, The Corner.  Dont let these crime dramas get you down, though, most city visitors are unlikely to have any encounters with the drug trade or really much anything to do with Baltimore culture for that matter. All the more reason why The Wire is practically required reading for a serious visitormdash;the show is filmed on location throughout the whole city, and nowhere else will you be so quickly and delightfully introduced to Baltimore in all its local character and sense of place: Baltimore club music, beautiful and dilapidated old row houses with marble stoops, the legendary horse-cart fruit vendor, coddies and pit beef, bottles of rye by the docks, the East-West rivalry, all sorts of local hip hop, a few good corrupt Polish cops, some angry young boys in the projects, and above all that sense of restlessness that keeps this city alive.</field>

		<field name="content">While Florida was first obtained by the United States in 1819, the central and southern regions of this new territory remained largely uninhabited as a result of the hostile Seminole Indian tribe, heat, and the high humidity of the region. Following the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, small groups of settlers began to trek into the interior of this region and build some of the first permanent settlements in this region, set up as forts to deter Seminole attacks. In 1851, the first permanent settlers reached this location near the headwaters of the Peace River and established Fort Blount (a quarter-mile west of the 1908 courthouse). The settlement remained small for many years. In 1861, Polk County was separated from Hillsborough County, with Fort Blout being chosen as the county seat. The Civil War halted development, but in 1867 county commissioners decided to rename Fort Blount in honor of Francis Bartow—the first Confederate officer to die in the war. A few years later, land donations from the cattle baron largest landowner in the region, Jacob Summerlin, allowed the Polk County government and the city of Bartow to develop: 40 acres for the county government, 20 acres for a school, and 20 acres each for two churches. In 1887, the first brick schoolhouse south of Jacksonville was built and named "Summerlin Institute".</field>

Be warned that, like the rest of the Southern United States during the summer, it can become down-right miserable, with sustained temperatures in the 90s (°F) with 100% humidity. Proper medical precautions should be taken if planning on partaking in outdoor activities, such as ample amounts of sunscreen and hydration. Also, there are many days throughout July that are classified as "ozone days," which are days on which the level of ground-level ozone is severe, causing health problems in sensitive individuals. This should be put into consideration before planning outdoor activities throughout the summer months.  Winter is usually mild and short-lived. Spring is glorious with cool nights and warm, sunny days. A light jacket is all that is needed.   Fall is mild and only a light sweater is needed in the evenings  Precipitation is reasonably well-distributed and ample throughout the year with an average annual precipitation of 55 in (140 cm)  Average summer temperature: 81.3°F (27°C) Average winter temperature: 52.5°F (11°C) Average annual temperature: 67.5°F (20°C)  Baton Rouge, like many cities in the Gulf States, has what is known as 5 seasons.

		<field name="content">As the population of the Bay Area grew in the 19th century, demand for timber led to large-scale logging of the redwoods in the Santa Cruz mountains. In 1902, a group of prominent citizens, led by the painter and photographer A.P. Hill, convinced the state legislature to establish a state park to preserve one of the last areas of virgin redwood forest in the Santa Cruz mountains.</field>

		<field name="content">Big Bear Lake, previously known as, Yuhaviat, was discovered back in 1845.  Benjamin Davis Wilson and a crew of twenty men rode into Yuhaviat Valley chasing Native Americans that had been raiding their ranches in Riverside, CA.  While in the valley, the men discovered that it was teeming with grizzly bear.  Thus, Wilson came up with the name, Big Bear Lake, for the valley.  Before Big Bear Lake became a popular vacation spot, it was known as a gold mining mecca.  In 1860, a bear tracker named, William Holcomb, discovered a creek filled with flakes of gold while tracking a bear’s blood trail.  Word soon got around that there was gold in the valley.  From 1860 to 1875, Big Bear Lake was swarming with prospectors in search of gold.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Big Bend National Park has an unusually rich history, the effects of which are present everywhere you look. The landscape is living testament: shaped over millions of years by volcanism, erosion, and enormous seismic events, it also still holds untold numbers of dinosaur fossils and sea creatures from when the area was engulfed by an ancient ocean.   Humans have inhabited the park for more than 10,000 years mdash; first were Native American tribes such as the Chisos, about which little is still known and, more recently, the Comanche and Mescalero Apache; all of whom have left their mark in the form of rock art, mortar holes, and shelters. Mexicans and Anglo settlers would establish a presence later, building homes, farms, ranches and mines (some of which persisted until as recently as the 1960s), of which many ruins can still be found.   Lobbying from locals and other admirers of the area (notably frontiersman Everett Townsend, the "father of the Big Bend National Park") convinced the state of Texas to set aside land for the park in 1933 (originally named "Texas Canyons State Park"). 1944 marks the formal establishment of Big Bend National Park, and it has been slowly growing ever since mdash; thousand-acre tracts are still being purchased, including the Harte and Fay Ranches in 1989 and 1994. There are tentative plans to integrate the park with its neighbor to the west,  Big Bend Ranch State Park , including trails that may connect the two.</field>

		<field name="content">The parks geography can be categorized into three distinct environments: desert, mountain, and river. The majority of Big Bend National Park encompasses Chihuahuan Desert, crisscrossed by arroyos (dry creek beds), washes and the occasional spring; wherever water exists, small oases of green vegetation flourish. Sprouting from the desert are numerous hills, mountains, and rock formations mdash; most of which are limestone but others are of volcanic origin.  The Rio Grande (Spanish for "Big River", although in Mexico its called Rio Bravo del Norte or just Rio Bravo, meaning "Wild River") flows south and east from its origin in  Colorado  and eventually passes through the park before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico after a journey of 1,885nbsp;mi (3,034nbsp;km). Here the river forms the 118nbsp;mi (190nbsp;km) long southern boundary of the park, passing through three major canyons (Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas) and through the desert, where green stands of trees, tall grasses and other riparian life cling to its banks.</field>

		<field name="content">Big Bend National Park is blessed with an exceptional array of plant and animal life. In the desert grow succulents such as lechuguilla (a type of agave), yuccas like the impressive giant dagger species, numerous types of cacti such as prickly pear, and abundant grasses and shrubs such as ocotillo, candellila, and sotol (all of which have numerous practical uses), as well as the famous century plant (or Havard agave), which only blooms once in a lifetime and then dies. The best time of year to see the gorgeous cactus blooms is March and April and the mountains are another great place to see wildflowers. In the mountains and near the water grow pleasantly surprising stands of juniper, ponderosa pines, piñon pine, douglas fir, Texas madrone, quaking aspen, the unique Chisos Oak (one of five Oak species here), and many others.  Big Bend is one of the best bird-watching areas in the country, as many birds pass through here along migratory routes mdash; more than 450 species. Big Bend is the only place in the U.S. where you can spot the Colima Warbler (check Boot Canyon along the South Rim trail from mid-April to mid-September). The Chisos Basin is a great place for birdwatching in general, but the best place is considered to be along the river, such as near Rio Grande Village and Cottonwood Campground. Among the countless species you may spot include roadrunners, woodpeckers, cardinals, quail, flycatchers, herons, hummingbirds, cliff swallows, owls, hawks, golden eagles, vultures, and peregrine falcons.  A great variety of animals make their home here, such as pig-like javelinas (pronounced "have a LEE nah" mdash; and theyre thought to be more closely related to hippopotamuses), mule deer, jackrabbits, skunks, raccoons, rock squirrels, kangaroo rats, coyote, foxes, and, in the mountains, rare black bears, mountain lions (AKA "panthers"), and white-tailed deer. They are all mostly shy, but you have a good chance of seeing them along roadways or even in the developed areas, especially starting at twilight. You may also glimpse snakes such as the "red racer" (western coachwhip), huge bull snakes (which have a tail like a rattlesnake but are not dangerous), and a small variety of venomous snakes. Lurking among the rocks are lizards: common whiptails, crevice spiny lizards, and earless lizards, along with the rare Texas horned lizard and large leopard and collared lizards. Around the river live turtles such as the Big Bend slider, amphibians such as the leopard toad, and mammals such as beavers. The endangered Mexican long-nosed bat is found only in the Chisos Mountains in the United States, while the entire worlds population of Big Bend mosquitofish (or Gambusia) is found in one pond, near the Rio Grande Village.</field>

July through October is the rainy season, where sudden downpours mdash; and consequently flash floods mdash; are possible; though rain usually doesnt last long and the water drains away quickly. Thunderstorms make for an epic spectacle and may lead to rare sights, such as  Pine Canyon Falls . The weather here can be significantly different from nearby areas; it might be overcast and rainy in nearby  Alpine  but clear and sunny in the park, so dont get too discouraged by local conditions. The park provides a weather hotline at +1 432 477-1183.   Spring and Fall: The onset of milder temperatures brings more visitors to the park. It can get quite windy in the spring, while the fall can experience rain until around September or October.    Winter: Winter is another popular time for visitors; expect cool weather interspersed with pleasant warm spells and occasional cold snaps mdash; snow and frost are not unheard of. Nights can be particularly cold.   Summer: This is the least busy season as temperatures can be brutal, often topping 100°F (38°C). May and June are the hottest months; the start of the rainy season in July tames the heat just slightly.</field>

		<field name="content">The City of Birmingham is relatively young. Founded in 1871 at the crossing of two railroad lines, it soon became known for its iron and steel industries. Named for Englands giant industrial city, Birmingham became a commercial hub as well, and today it is one of the top five banking cities in the United States.   "The Magic City" became known as a thriving and quickly growing community in what had once been a "poor, insignificant Southern village." White and black men migrated from rural communities to work in the iron mills, and so did many Greek and Italian immigrants. The Great Depression was disastrous for Birmingham, singled out as the "worst hit" city in America. World War II brought a strong recovery, but air pollution remained a problem. Old-timers recall that it used to take only took a few minutes outdoors for a clean white shirt to turn gray in the sooty Birmingham air. Sloss Furnaces, a preserved iron mill with 1920s blast furnaces, commemorates this side of the citys heritage.   The Civil Rights era of the 1960s left lasting impressions of racial conflict, police dogs and fire hoses turned on nonviolent protesters, and the bombing of homes and churches. Martin Luther King Jr.s "Letter from the Birmingham Jail" became one of the great statements of the nonviolent movement for racial justice in America. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and places of reflections such as Kelly Ingram Park symbolize the healing process from within and present a much different picture of a transformed city.  Today, Birmingham is a banking and medical center. The University of Alabama at Birmingham and associated hospitals are internationally renowned for their medical programs, research, and services.</field>

When driving through or hiking in Black Canyon, you are apt to see many species of wildlife such as elk and coyotes. But by far one of the most elegant and common animals is the mule deer. Mule deer have adapted to many different types of habitats and seem to thrive in all of them. As you look into the depths of the canyon it may be hard to believe that these animals are just as at home trekking to the canyon bottom as they are meandering the oak flats on the rims.</field>

Most of the Black Hills gently roll from 5000-6000 feet in elevation, however many peaks in the south central hills are over 7000 feet above sea level.  Harney Peak is the tallest mountain at 7242 feet, which is also the highest point of South Dakota.  Several trails can be taken to the top which has an old CCC fire lookout tower at the summit.   In the southern hills, trees are sparse, and prairie grasses prevail.  This is also where most of the larger cave systems are located, such as  Wind Cave National Park  and  Jewel Cave National Monument .    Minerals of many types are found in abundance throughout the Black Hills, commonly found is:  Granite, muscovite, and quartz.  Gold and Silver were originally found in great amounts in the northern areas near the Wyoming South Dakota border.</field>

		<field name="content">The Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, and the Monacan, Saponi, and Tutelo Indians of western Virginia, were among the earliest inhabitants of the Blue Ridge, leaving artifacts and changes in the landscape as evidence of their existence. Many of the fields still visible at the base of the mountains date back centuries to ancient American Indian agricultural methods of burning and deadening the trees and underbrush to provide needed grazing and crop land. Mountain and river names along the Parkway also reflect the American Indian influence. The best place to learn about the pre-history of the Appalachian chain in Virginia is at the Peaks of Otter Visitor Center museum (milepost 85.9). Arrowheads and early tools found in the Peaks area are exhibited. In North Carolina, the Parkway enters the Cherokee Indian Reservation at milepost 457.7 and features an informational display on the reservation at the Lickstone Parking Overlook (milepost 458.9).</field>

The easy Mountain Farm Self-Guiding Trail takes you through a collection of 19th century farm buildings, and in the summer months there are often living history demonstrations. The Visitor Center exhibits represent the most complete effort at interpreting the Blue Ridge region with stories about early housing, community, entertainment, and transportation. At the Peaks of Otter (Milepost 85.9) there is a moderate loop trail leading to the Johnson Farm, in which generations of the Johnson family lived and worked with other members of the now-vanished community. Another structure of interest here is Polly Woods Ordinary, representative of the early days of tourism in the area. The Trail Cabin (Milepost 154.6), Puckett Cabin (Milepost 189.9), Brinegar Cabin (Milepost 238.5), Caudill Cabin (Milepost 241), and Sheets Cabin (Milepost 252.4) are all 19th-century log cabins illustrating the occasional isolated existence of mountain residents and the efforts of the original park planners to save log structures as opposed to other types of larger farm houses they found. The Jesse Brown Farmstead (Milepost 272.5) consists of a cabin, spring house, and the relocated Cool Springs Baptist Church.</field>

Yankee Horse Ridge Parking Area (milepost 34.4) has a short stretch of reconstructed narrow-gauge railroad track once known as the Irish Creek Railway, along with an exhibit on logging in the area. The James River Visitor Center (Milepost 63.6) has an exhibit on the ill-fated James River and Kanawha Canal, with a self-guiding trail to a restored lock dating from the mid-19th century. Mining operations in the Appalachians are remembered in place names such as Iron Mine Hollow (mile posts 96.2, 96.4) and at an exhibit in the North Toe Valley Overlook, Milepost 318.4. Of all the points of interest on the Parkway, perhaps Mabry Mill (Milepost 176.2) is the best known. The Mabry Mill Trail features a black smith shop, wheel wrights shop, and whiskey still, as well as the most photographed structure on the Parkway, Mabry Mill itself. As anyone who has traveled in the Appalachians knows, mountain crafts are one of the most popular attractions. Traditional crafts and music still thrive in the Blue Ridge mountains of today. Along the Parkway in North Carolina are several places to view and purchase locally made items, such as the Northwest Trading Post (Milepost 258.6), the Moses Cone Estate and Parkway Craft Center (Milepost 294.1), and the Folk Art Center (Milepost 382).</field>

		<field name="content">By the 20th century, the Blue Ridge was viewed as a desirable location for men of wealth to build retreats. The Moses H. Cone and Julian Price Memorial Parks (Mileposts 292 - 298) are examples of this. The Cone estate includes a turn-of-the-century manor house and 24 miles of carriage roads, while the Julian Price Park offers several short trails and a lake.  The most obvious modern contributor to the landscape is of course the Parkway itself, conceived and designed over 60 years ago as a scenic motor road and conservator of the natural and historical treasures of the Blue Ridge. Groundbreaking took place in September 1935 and the work was contracted and completed in "sections." By World War II, about one-half of the road was completed and by the 1960s, all but one section was opened to the public. Fifty Celtic laborers died during the construction, earning the nickname of Bealach Báis. In 1987, the last section was completed around Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina, including the Linn Cove Viaduct at Milepost 304, an environmentally sensitive, award winning bridge. Today, the Blue Ridge Parkway is the most visited site in the National Park system.</field>

		<field name="content">Although the Blue Ridge Parkway is often seen primarily as a scenic byway with many natural attractions, it is also a cross-section of Appalachian mountain history. Stretching almost 500 miles along the crest of the Blue Ridge mountains through North Carolina and Virginia, it encompasses some of the oldest settlements of both pre-historic and early European settlement. Overlook signs, visitor center exhibits, restored historic structures, and developed areas, all point out and explain the interesting history.</field>

		<field name="content">From Milepost 0 at Rockfish Gap, Virginia to Milepost 355 near Mount Mitchell State Park, North Carolina, the Parkway lives up to its name by following the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains, averaging about 3,000 feet in elevation, and occasionally dipping down into the coves and hollows or crossing low-elevation water gaps. At Mount Mitchell, the Parkway veers westward through the Black Mountains, then into the Craggies before descending toward Asheville. From there, the road climbs to elevations over 6,000 feet in the Balsam Mountains before entering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Cherokee.  Along this route an unsurpassed diversity of climate, vegetation, and geological features are passed. The more than 81,000 acres (32,779 ha) of Parkway lands pass through a highland area of five degrees longitude and approximately 3 degrees latitude, making it the third largest unit of the National Park Service in terms of area covered. The Parkway includes 400 streams, including 150 headwaters. Forty-seven Natural Heritage Areas (areas set aside as national, regional or state examples of exemplary natural communities), a variety of slopes and exposures, and possibly 100 different soil types.</field>

		<field name="content">With an elevation range of 5,700 feet (1,737m) the Parkway provides a home for both southern species at the lower elevations and northern species on the mountaintops. Taking advantage of this diversity are 14 major vegetation types, over 1,200 vascular plant species (50 threatened or endangered), and almost 100 species of non-native plants. Nearly 100 species of trees grow along the Parkway, about as many as are found in all of Europe. Added to that are estimates of almost 400 species of mosses and nearly 2000 species of fungi. The wide variety of trees makes for a particularly colorful autumn landscape.   Purple rhododendrons bloom from early June around the Peaks of Otter in Virginia to the third week of June at Craggy Gardens in North Carolina. Any time between those dates, there are spots of this variety blooming. Larger white rhododendrons begin in mid to late June and bloom into July, primarily through  Rocky Knob , Virginia. Flame Azalea, Pink Azalea or Pinxter Flower bloom early to late May in many Parkway areas. Mountain Laurel blooms mid to late June and into July in higher elevations.  Many species of animals live along the Parkway. Fifty-four different mammals, more than 50 salamanders and 40 reptiles can be found on Parkway lands. One hundred fifty-nine species of birds are known to nest here with dozens of others passing through during fall and spring migrations.  The Parkways varied vegetative habitats, successive floral displays, autumn foliage, geological features, and animals are major attractions each year for 20 million visitors--the highest visitation in the NPS system.</field>

For centuries, the spring area was home for Native Americans. In 1766 it was visited by Colonial American botanist John Bartram, and was settled by Louis Thursby and his family in 1856. The Thursby house, built in 1872, remains standing. The spring´s crystal clear, 73 degree water can be enjoyed by swimmers, snorkelers, and certified scuba divers with a partner.  Canoes and Kayaks cam navigate the outlets swift-flowing waters when Manatees are not present.</field>

		<field name="content">New England is unpredictable and becomes very cold in the winter and is prone to bouts of humidity and some surprisingly high temperatures considering the region, often topping out in the 90s, in the summer.  Boston summers are warm and humid, with sunshine 60-65% of the time and typical highs in the mid 70s to high 80s F (mid to upper 20s C).  When the heat does start, there are some beaches within the city, and many beaches outside of it, for swimming.  Beware that no matter how hot it is outside, the ocean water will not be warm, with the exception of some beaches on nearby  Cape Cod .  Early and late summer tends to be nice, but this varies by year. In that time, the temperature will be perfect, and there will be no humidity.  The city does have unpredictable stretches of heat between late June and early August when low 90s and high humidity are expected.  All public transit options, including cabs, buses, and the public transit system (both formally and informally called the T) are air-conditioned, with the exception of some older cars on the heavy rail T lines such as the Orange Line, Blue Line, and Red Line.  Bostons fall foliage is at or near its peak beauty in mid-October, which also normally offers the advantage of many crisp sunny days (outside the city itself, peak foliage timing depends on how far north or south you venture from Boston.)  If you visit during the wintertime, the Atlantic Ocean has a large moderating effect on temperatures. The average low in January is 22F/-5C, so there may be snow, freezing rain, or hail. However, it doesnt snow anywhere near as much as many other cities due to the effect of the ocean. There is only snowfall on 10 days or so per year, at the absolute maximum.</field>

		<field name="content">Massachusetts first governor, John Winthrop, famously called Boston a "shining city on the hill," a reference to Jerusalem and a declaration of the original settlers intent to build a utopian Christian colony. From the very beginning, the people who lived there declared their home to be one of the most important cities in the world. Considering that the American Revolution and modern democracy got their start thanks to Bostonians, and that Winthrop’s quote is still used in modern political speech, one could argue that they were right!  The father of American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes) once called the Boston statehouse "the hub of the solar system," but common usage has expanded to the now-current Hub of the Universe. This half-serious term is all you need to know to understand Bostons complicated self-image.  Vastly important in American history, and for centuries the seat of the USAs social elite, Boston lost prominence in the early twentieth century, largely to the cities of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Over the past two decades, Boston has regained political, cultural, and economic importance.  In 1629, Reverend William Blackstone was the first English immigrant to arrive in the city. A year later, John Winthrop and the Massachusetts Bay Colony had followed. The Massachusetts Bay Colony were Puritan religious dissidents who had fled  England  to find freedom in the New World. At the time the city was called Shawmut, a name coined by Native American settlers, however now a new settlement, Winthrop had decided to rename the city Boston after his hometown in England. Because of its easily-defended harbor and the fact that it is the closest port to Europe it rapidly assumed a leading role in the fledging  New England  region, with a booming economy based on trade with the Caribbean and Europe.  The devastating Fire of 1760 destroyed much of the town, but within a few years the city had bounced back.  Boston was also a city of great intellectual potential. Many statesmen had emerged in Boston along with prestigious Schools such as Harvard and the first public school in America, Boston Latin. With the founding of these schools as well as the first printing press in New England, Boston was becoming more of a colonial society.  Bostonians were the instigators of the independence movement in the 18th century and the city was the center of Americas revolutionary activity during the Colonial period.  Several of the first Revolutionary War skirmishes were fought there, including the Boston Massacre, The Boston Tea Party, and the battles of Lexington and Concord -which were fought nearby.  Bostons direct involvement in the Revolution ended after the Battle of Bunker Hill and, soon afterwards, the ending of the Siege of Boston by George Washington.  For some time afterwards the citys political leaders continued to have a leading role in developing of the new countrys system of government. The residents ardent support of independence earned the city the nickname The Cradle of Liberty.  Throughout the 19th century, Boston continued to grow rapidly, assimilating outlying towns into the metropolitan core. Its importance in American culture was inestimable, and its economic and literary elite, the so-called Boston Brahmins assumed the mantle of aristocracy in the United States.  Their patronage of the arts and progressive social ideals was unprecedented in the New World, and often conflicted with the citys Puritan foundations.  They helped drive unprecedented scientific, educational and social change that would soon sweep the country. The Abolitionist movement, anesthesia and the telephone are a few examples of this.  At the same time, the citys working class swelled with immigrants from Europe. The huge Irish influx made Boston one of the most important Irish cities in the world, in or out of Ireland.  Gradually the Irish laborer population climbed into citys upper class, evidenced no better than by the continued importance of the Kennedy family in national politics.  From the early twentieth century until the 1970s, Bostons importance on the national stage waned. Cities in what was once the frontier, like  Chicago ,  San Francisco , and later  Los Angeles , shifted the nations center of gravity away from libertys cradle. In the past two decades, Bostons importance and influence has increased, due to growth in higher education, health care, high technology, and financial services. It remains Americas higher educational center; during the school year, one in five Bostonians are university students. There are more college students per square foot in Boston than any other city in the Western Hemisphere.  Bostons nicknames include "Beantown",  "The Hub" (shortened from Oliver Wendell Holmes phrase The Hub of the Universe), "The City of Higher Learning" (due to the plethora of universities and colleges in the Boston area) and - particularly in the 19th century - "The Athens of America," on account of its great cultural and intellectual influence. If you dont want to stand out as a tourist, dont refer to Boston by any of these nicknames. Locals generally dont use any of them, except the heavy use of "Hub" in journalism (Boston takes up more headline space).</field>

		<field name="content">The last glacial period dramatically altered the landscape in the region which now comprises northern Minnesota and Ontario, Canada, leaving behind innumerable lakes and streams surrounded by forest. The BWCAW is located in the northern third of the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota.   The waterways were travelled by many Native American tribes, including Huron, Souix, Chippewa and Cree, followed by the Dakota and the Ojibwe. Pictographs can be seen in multiple areas of the BWCAW to this day. In the 18th and 19th centuries, fur traders, the voyageurs or coureur de bois, used the waterways for trade and transportation of furs. In the late 1800s to early 1900s, the area was heavily logged.   On February 13, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt designated an area of approximately 1 million acres as the Superior National Forest.  Over the next 50 years, the area was expanded and finally in 1964, the Wilderness Act designated the BWCA as a unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Finally, in 1978, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the current regulations to protect and preserve the area.  On July 4, 1999, severe thuderstorms with intense straight-line winds known as the Boundary Waters-Canadian Derecho caused serious damage to nearly 400,000 acres of forests in and around the BWCAW. The resulting blowdown has been managed by the forest service with proscribed burns, but has led to increased risk of forest fires in the affected areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Unpredictable. One constant is the perilously long frigid winters. An important note to the stability of this wildernesss survival is the constant thickness of its lake ice throughout the winters. Four to seven feet of lake ice is common from winter to winter with the number of subzero days (that is days within a 365-day year the temperature dips below 0°F/-18°C) averaging around 90°F (32°C). Snow can fall at any month of the year and is actually highest around the months of March and April. Minnesotas state record low of -60°F (-51°C) was officially reported in Tower, just south of the BWCAW. However many feel that temperatures could be as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit colder within some of the top ridges of the Laurention Highlands which seemingly bisect the BWCAW. Without any records taken from within the BWCAW this has yet to be proven. Average winter snowfall in the area can be as high as 150 inches (381 cm) atop the ridges of the Superior highlands off the shore of  Lake Superior  with about 75-90 inches (190-229 cm) of snowfall being the norm throughout the rest of the BWCAW. Summers are short and generally cool with offshore breezes from Lake Superior dramatically cooling areas near the shore. Temperatures can be as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit cooler near the coast opposed to inland areas. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32°C)but if they do, consider yourself blessed and swim at every opportunity. Summer weather lasts from mid June to mid August. Generally the first significant snowfall (2 in/5 cm or more) occurs in early October. Lakes tend to freeze to a walkable thickness (4 in/10 cm) by late October. The average yearly temperature ranges from 29-36 degrees Fahrenheit. One reason for this cold climate is that it is centered in the North American continent. The closest ocean inlet is actually the Hudson Bay which is frozen for 70 percent of the time. Due to thin acidic soil and the climate, agriculture would not only be impractical but nearly impossible. Forests cover over 99% of dry land and the rest of the region is composed of 40% water.</field>

It is an Intermountain Grassland habitat, bordered closely by Montane Forest habitat.  Bozeman is bordered on three sides by mountain ranges (Bridger, Gallatin, and Tobacco Root) making up the northern Rockies. To the south, youll find Yellowstone National Park as well as Gallatin National Forest.  Bozemans geographical location combined with its climate make for a lush, agriculturally rich and diverse location. Its close proximity to the mountains and forest lands creates a plethora of outdoor activities year-round.</field>

		<field name="content">Native American Salish people lived comfortably in the Puget Sound area navigating the local waterways in well made cedar canoes for thousands of years before 1792 when Captain George Vancouver discovered the area, named it after one of his officers and declared the area for Great Briton.  Once the Washington Territory was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area tribes to acquire their lands. The Suquamish people ceded most of their land around the Kitsap Peninsula to the United States and logging came into the area in full force. The areas once impassible thick forests gave way to farms, towns and industry as lumber was shipped off to areas such as San Francisco or burned as fuel for the growing fleet of boats known as the Mosquito Fleet. In 1888, William Bremer, a German immigrant from a wealthy banking family, traveled by boat from Seattle and purchased land that is now Bremerton from a local logger.  In 1891, Bremer negotiated with Lt. A.B. Wyckoff to sell 190 acres to the U.S. Navy for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, still a major employer. Bremer platted the town around the Navys property and gave it his name. He opened businesses to support the Navys activities.  The City of Bremerton was incorporated in 1901. The Bremerton Chamber of Commerce was incorporated in 1928 with William Gates, Sr., grandfather of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, as treasurer.  The town exploded in size during World War I and II, when more than 40,000 workers arrived to work at the shipyard. Since then fortunes have been through boom and bust and the town is now revitalizing the downtown area.</field>

		<field name="content">The area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1875 and was known to have described the canyon as "a hell of a place to lose a cow".  President Warren G. Harding proclaimed Bryce Canyon a national monument on June 8, 1923. On June 7, 1924, Congress passed a bill to establish Utah National Park, when all land within the national monument would become the property of the United States government. The land was acquired and the name was restored to Bryce Canyon. On February 25, 1928, Bryce Canyon officially became a national park.</field>

		<field name="content">Bryce Canyon in the snow   Bryce Canyon consists of a series of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters carved from the eastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah. The erosional force of frost-wedging and the dissolving power of rainwater have shaped the colorful limestone rock of the Claron Formation into bizarre shapes including slot canyons, windows, fins, and spires called "hoodoos."  The varied colors of the rocks and rock formations contribute to the spectacular views.  Bryce lies at a much higher elevation than nearby  Zion National Park  and the  Grand Canyon , varying from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2,440 to 2,740 m), whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet (2130 m) above sea level. Bryce Canyon National Park therefore has a substantially different ecology and climate, offering a contrast for visitors who visit all three parks in a single vacation.</field>

When visiting, do not, under any circumstances, feed the wildlife or allow wildlife to obtain human food.  Animals which obtain food from humans often become aggressive, will sometimes get ill or even die due to a change in diet, and most seriously stop foraging for natural foods and frequently starve to death in winter months when human food is no longer available.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Though the Buffalo area had been settled by the Iroquois since well before Columbus and was visited periodically by French fur trappers beginning in the 17th Century, Buffalos history per se begins about 1789, when Cornelius Winney set up a trading post at the mouth of the Buffalo River. At the time, this site was still far beyond the frontier of white settlement; it was not until 1793 when the Holland Land Company, a syndicate of investors from the  Netherlands , purchased the tract of Western New York wilderness that included Buffalo. Land agent Joseph Ellicott, who arrived in what is now Buffalo in 1798, felt that the site had the potential to be the site of a thriving settlement. He gave the name New Amsterdam to the village he laid out at the site of Winneys trading post, though it was soon renamed Buffalo after the adjacent river. (The question of where the Buffalo River itself got its name is still very much a mystery—there have never been any buffalo in the area at any time since the arrival of the white man, and the most well-known theory, which has the French explorer Sieur de la Salle exclaiming about the beau fleuve, or "beautiful river", that he saw while passing by in 1679 on his ship Le Griffon, is almost certainly untrue.)  Despite Ellicotts aspirations, Buffalo remained a tiny outpost whose main claim to fame during its very early history was as the site of several important military installations and battles during the War of 1812 (famously, the village was burnt to the ground by British troops in December 1813 as part of the Niagara Frontier Campaign of that war). That all changed with the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825; the status of the western terminus of the canal was granted to Buffalo after a hotly contested dispute with the neighboring village of Black Rock (later to be annexed by its rival). The Erie Canal extended eastward from Lake Erie to the Hudson River at  Albany , a distance of 363 miles (584km) in all. The most ambitious work of infrastructure undertaken in the U.S. up to that time, the Erie Canal greatly lowered transportation costs and singlehandedly made large-scale settlement of the lands west of the Appalachians economically viable. The magnitude of the Erie Canals commercial importance is illustrated by the fact that in the first five years after its completion, Buffalos population more than tripled (to 8,668); two years later, in 1832, Buffalo was finally incorporated as a city.   Buffalos early economic mainstay was as a transshipment port, where grain from the Midwest was unloaded from lake freighters and transferred to canal boats headed for  New York City ; it was in Buffalo where the worlds first grain elevator was constructed in 1843, and indeed there are still many elevators that remain standing around Buffalo Harbor. Over the second half of the 19th Century, the Erie Canal gradually became obsolete, but that scarcely affected Buffalos explosive growth. Instead, the city maintained its status as a transportation hub by transitioning into the second-most important railroad center in the U.S. (after  Chicago ); the New York Central, Pennsylvania, Michigan Central, Nickel Plate, Erie, DLW, West Shore, and Lehigh Valley Railroads all passed through Buffalo at the height of the railroad era. In addition, the steel industry became a major player in the local economy in 1899, when the Lackawanna Steel Company moved its base of operations from  Scranton , Pennsylvania to a site just south of the city line. By 1900, the city boasted a population of over 350,000 and was one of the ten largest cities in the United States.    Located in the shadow of downtown, the Commercial Slip (seen here) was once the western end of the Erie Canal, which was built in 1825 and which transformed Buffalo almost overnight from a sleepy frontier village to one of the United States fastest-growing cities and most important inland ports. It is now the centerpiece of the Canalside redevelopment on the downtown waterfront.   The Pan-American Exposition was a Worlds Fair that was held in Buffalo in 1901, at the apex of the citys glory days; it was intended to showcase, among other things, the technological marvel and economic possibilities of electric power (Buffalos proximity to  Niagara Falls , a site of early ventures in the generation of hydroelectricity, gifted it with the cheapest electricity in the nation at the time). Though the dazzling sight of the fairgrounds, illuminated by night with this new technology, earned Buffalo the enduring nickname "City of Light", the Pan-American Expositions main historical significance is much more somber in nature: it was at the Exposition on September 6, 1901, when U.S. President William McKinley was fatally shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz, moments after concluding a speech at the Temple of Music.  Buffalo continued to grow during the first part of the 20th Century. However, trends were beginning to emerge that would, by 1950, cause the citys growth to slow, stop and then reverse. As in other American cities, wealthier residents began to leave their homes in town for quieter, greener suburban properties outside the city line. This began in the 1910s and 1920s—many of Buffalos older suburbs, such as  Kenmore ,  Eggertsville ,  Pine Hill , and  Snyder , date to this time—and kicked into high gear during the post-World War II economic boom. At the same time, the growing American middle class began to migrate in ever-larger numbers to areas in the West and South with milder climates, at the further expense of the cities of the Northeast. The construction of the Interstate Highway System fueled suburbanization at the same time that it contributed to the decline of the railroads and of Buffalos port, as goods could be shipped more cheaply by truck.   However, the single most important cause of the free-fall that Buffalo suffered during the late 20th Century was the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. Historically, Buffalos importance as a port was largely due to the barrier that Niagara Falls posed to shipping. However, thanks to the expansion of the Welland Canal as part of the Seaway, freighters loaded with grain and other goods could now access the ocean directly via the St. Lawrence River, rather than stopping at Buffalo to transfer their cargo to railroad cars headed east. Within ten years of the Seaways inauguration, most of the grain elevators at Buffalo Harbor had been abandoned, and the port that was once filled to capacity with ships was now nearly empty. As well, the steel plant in  Lackawanna  closed its doors for good beginning in 1977, unable to compete with cheaper foreign steel. By 1980, Buffalos population was roughly equal to what it had been in 1900, down nearly 40% from its peak of 580,132 just thirty years earlier.  To add insult to injury, during the 1960s and 70s Buffalos civic leaders responded to the deteriorating social conditions in the city by demolishing (in the name of "urban renewal" and "slum clearance") ethnic neighborhoods in such places as the Ellicott District and the Lower West Side that, though working-class, were in many cases healthy and vibrant. In particular, the splendid brick Victorian cottages of what was once the Lower West Sides "Little Italy" were nearly all lost to the wrecking ball, while the new public housing projects erected in the Ellicott District soon became high-rise versions of the slums they replaced, as the mere construction of new buildings did nothing to address the underlying social problems in the neighborhood. At the same time, noisy and intrusive expressways were constructed directly through Delaware Park and Humboldt Parkway, destroying the verdant ambience of what were (respectively) the largest park and the grandest parkway designed for the city by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted; thankfully, forceful opposition from neighborhood residents spared the Allentown Historic District a similar fate. In downtown, only one of the many examples of the senseless destruction of Buffalos architectural heritage occurred in 1969, when several blocks of handsome Victorian commercial blocks as well as the stunning, castlelike Erie County Savings Bank building were demolished to make way for the Main Place Tower, a bland modernist office tower with an attached suburban-style shopping mall that utterly failed to attract shoppers back downtown in favor of the strip malls and plazas of the suburbs.  Despite these grave problems, the mentality in Buffalo never crossed the line into total defeatism, which was helpful when Buffalos decline started to level off in the 1990s. The broad-based grassroots protests that accompanied the opening of the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in 2007, which had been presented to the city as a means of spurring development and attracting tourists, serves as perhaps the quintessential example of the citys new approach: rather than relying on one-shot "silver bullet" solutions to the citys problems such as the casino, Buffalo has begun to model its strategy on the successful revival of other Rust Belt cities such as  Pittsburgh  and  Cleveland —a strategy that has consisted of accepting the reality that heavy industry is gone for good and, instead, using the valuable resource of Buffalos unusually high number of colleges and universities to encourage development of a diverse range of high-tech industries, such as the medical research and biotechnology ventures that have sprouted north of downtown under the aegis of the University of Buffalo Medical School. The business district, once replete with boarded-up storefronts and nearly deserted after the end of the workday and on weekends, has enjoyed a new measure of vitality due largely to the conversion of disused office space into high-end downtown apartments and condominiums, a commodity for which many Buffalonians were surprised to discover there was considerable pent-up demand. Additionally, Buffalo can boast of an architectural heritage that is still substantial despite the misadventures of the 1960s, a vibrant range of cultural institutions, and a perennially low cost of living. In the past few years, this new approach has engendered a newfound strength among Buffalos preservationist community, a dogged devotion by its citizens to cultural attractions such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo Zoo, and continued diversification of the local economy. Conversely, what remains of Buffalos traditional heavy industry has benefited from the mini-rebound in American manufacturing after the most recent recession; for example, despite General Motors recent financial troubles, that company made substantial investments in its plant in nearby  Tonawanda  in 2010, adding several hundred new jobs in the process. Though Buffalo has not completely stemmed its population losses and there is still much progress yet to be made, the bit of swagger with which residents of the "City of No Illusions" carry themselves today, finally reinvigorated after decades of decline, is unmistakable.</field>

		<field name="content">Buffalo, although most famous for its winters, has four very pronounced seasons.  In the first half of winter, beginning in approximately November, the city can get lake-effect snow: cold winds blowing over the warmer waters of Lake Erie pick up a lot of water vapor, which is dumped as snow as soon as they reach land.  This usually ends in January, when the lake finally freezes over.  Contrary to popular myth, however, Buffalo is not the coldest or snowiest city in the countrymdash;or even in New York. The Buffalo airport averages 93 inches (236cm) of snow per winter. On average, Buffalo only has 3 days per year where the recorded temperature dips below 0ºF (-18ºC). Buffalos snowy reputation is based in large part on some of its most famous storms: The Blizzard of 77, and the October Storm of 2006, both which received a lot of media coverage; however, neither is a normal occurrence in the average Buffalo winter.  Spring is rainy and cool up through the end of April. The temperatures can fluctuate wildly in March and April. It is not unusual to see snow one day, and a temperature in the mid-60s Fahrenheit (almost 20ºC) the next.   Summer tends to be very comfortable and sunny—in fact, Buffalo has more sunny summer days than any other major city in the Northeastern U.S. The moderating effects of Lake Erie have allowed Buffalo to be one of very few places in the United States where the temperature has never reached 100ºF (38ºC). On average Buffalo has 60 days a year with temperatures reaching over 80°F (27ºC).    A typical winter day in Buffalos historic West Village.   Fall is warm and beautiful as well. The temperature usually stays warm enough through mid November, and one can watch the trees change colors in comfort. The days are warm, the nights are cool, and the first frost doesnt usually come until well after Halloween. Leaf hunters will be pleased with the number of trees (Buffalo is also one of the most tree-filled cities in the nation!) as well as in the surrounding areas.</field>

		<field name="content">The history and extent of Buffalos association with American cinema may come as a surprise to some. Early on in movie history, downtown Buffalos Ellicott Square Building was home to the worlds first purpose-built, permanent motion-picture theater, the Vitascope Theater, which was opened on October 19, 1896 by Mitchel and Moe Mark, who some years later would go on to build the worlds first "movie palace" in New York City. Also in 1896, Thomas Edison sent camera crews to Buffalo, making it one of the first cities in America to appear in the movies. Edison also had the Pan-American Exposition filmed in 1901.  Under the aegis of the Buffalo Niagara Film Commission, an embryonic film industry has developed in the area which is beginning to produce some quality independent features. These and the more than 100 other films that have been shot in the Buffalo area over the last century include:    Hide in Plain Sight (1980). Based on a true story. A working-class husband (James Caan) tries to track down his wife and children who are hidden away by a witness protection program.   Best Friends (1982). Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn play a couple whose lives turn upside-down when, after years of living and working together, they decide to get married.   The Natural (1984). Robert Redford and Glenn Close star in an adaptation of Bernard Malamuds novel about Roy Hobbs, a mysterious baseball player who appears out of nowhere to turn around the fortunes of a 1930s team.   Buffalo 66 (1998). Buffalo native Vincent Gallo wrote, directed and starred in this critically-acclaimed dark comedy about a man who, after being released from jail for a crime he did not commit, vows to track down the Buffalo Bills kicker who put him there, all the while forcing a young tap dancer (Christina Ricci) to pose as his wife to earn respect from his neglectful parents.   Bruce Almighty (2003). Jim Carrey stars as a hapless field reporter for WKBW-TVs Eyewitness News who, after complaining to God about his misfortunes in life, is allowed to stand in for the Supreme Being to see how well he performs in the role. Though the bulk of Bruce Almighty was shot in  San Diego , the movie is set in Buffalo, most of the exterior shots were filmed there, and many real-life WKBW anchors make cameo appearances in the film.   Unstoppable (2010). Based on the true story of the CSX 8888 incident of 2001, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are two Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad workers tasked with stopping a runaway train carrying a cargo of toxic chemicals.   Henrys Crime (2011). Keanu Reeves stars as a former Thruway toll collector who, after spending time in jail for a crime he did not commit, decides to get his revenge by holding up in real life the same bank he had been falsely convicted of robbing.</field>

		<field name="content">Many prehistoric and historic cultural sites are located in the park, some dating back more than 10,000 years.  These sites range from terrace village sites, to bluff shelters once occupied by Archaic Indians, to cabins built by early settlers.  In Boxley valley, Ozark farmers still live in harmony with the land.  Other areas, such as the Parker-Hickman Farmstead in Erbie, the Rush Mining District, the 1930s Collier Homestead at Tyler Bend, and the Civilian Conservation Corps structures at Buffalo Point, represent the progression of Buffalo River history.  Trails in these areas lead the hiker back in time to an era when the natural and cultural world were one.   How did a river surrounded by the progress of civilization escape impoundment, impairment, and change? The Buffalo National River encompasses the diversity of the natural resources that are the Ozarks. This was acknowledged by an U.S. House of Representatives Committee Reports (1972) that explained the basis for the establishment of the Buffalo National River. It stated, "Because it is a pure, free-flowing stream which has not been significantly altered by industry or man, it is considered to be one of the country’s last significant natural rivers. It is not one single quality, but the combination of its size, its completeness, its wild qualities, and its associated natural, scenic and historic resources that makes the Buffalo worthy of national recognition."</field>

		<field name="content">Overlook view of the Buffalo River   Morning on the Buffalo River   A Bluff Along the Buffalo   confluence of the Buffalo and Little Buffalo  Buffalo National River has over 300 caves within its boundary. The Ozark Plateau is one of the most cavernicolous areas in the United States. Karst is a type of topography that is usually formed in rocks such as limestone and dolomite. It is characterized by an integration of surface and ground water via sinkholes, caves, losing streams, and springs.      The Ozark Mountains as a whole can be described as a southward tilted, uplifted plateau that has been dissected by the erosional effects of water resulting in dendritic or tree-branch shaped watersheds. Within the Ozark Mountains four major physiographic regions have been described: the Boston Mountains, Springfield Plateau, Salem Plateau, and the St. Francis Mountains. The drainage area of the Buffalo River is a mixture of the Boston Mountains, Springfield and Salem Plateaus.  The number and size of the springs and seeps within the Buffalo National River has never been quantified. Large springs that have perennial outputs, such as Mitch Hill Spring and Gilbert Spring, have been monitored for water-quality for more than 10 years, and much is known about the quantity, quality, and the aquatic organisms that reside in these springs. However, there could be thousands of springs and seeps within the watershed of the Buffalo River where little is known. These islands of aquatic and mesic habitats could be home to many rare or endemic species of macroinvertebrates and vascular plants.</field>

		<field name="content">The plant communities that compose the forests of the Ozark Mountains are composed mainly of Oak-Hickory communities; however, many other types of plant communities exist and these communities are much influenced by the geology of the area. Gradients of plant diversity and species composition can be seen on almost any mountainside that is of moderate elevation. Plant community composition within the Ozark Mountains exhibit gradients of species change similar to other mountain systems; however, these gradients are due to the accessibility of water and nutrients and not temperature or elevations, as is the case with other mountainous regions in the U. S.  The vegetative community at Buffalo National River is rich and diverse. The ridges, bluffs, hillsides, and valleys provide a variety of habitats that support over 1500 plant species. The major forest types are the Floodplain, Mixed-Hardwood, Oak-Hickory, Oak-Pine, Cedar Glade and Beech. Forests, cultivated fields, and abandoned fields at different stages of ecological succession throughout the area support small herds of elk and other wildlife.  Wildflowers can be seen nearly year round at Buffalo National River, but spring is the peak season. Spring rains and warm balmy days bring amazing color to the fields and roadsides of the park. In early spring many wildflowers can be found on the forest floor.  In the eons old progression of seasons, animal abundance within the Ozark Mountains ebbs and flows as animals migrate into and out of the oak-hickory ecosystem that exists within the rough hills and valleys that create the Buffalo River. With the coming of spring, animal movement is at its highest. Fish are actively migrating up the river corridor into tributaries, and songbirds are arriving from far off places, filling the forest canopy with movement and song. Wildlife observers have recorded 55 species of mammals, 250 species of birds, and 59 species of fish, along with a multitude of reptiles, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates.   In 1995 the largest sighting of feral hogs on the Buffalo National River was reported, a herd of 35 hogs was observed in the Lower Buffalo Wilderness Area. Feral hogs have been released into the park from numerous sources in the last 2 decades, and now hogs range up and down the whole river corridor.  In 1981, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission began an Elk Restoration Project that has been an overwhelming success, and now special-permit hunting is required to keep the ever-growing population in balance. Visitors to the park can see the elk most frequently in the late winter and early spring in the meadows of Boxley Valley along the upper reaches of the river.  The "buffalo" in the context of the parks name is not entirely clear. The name could refer to the American Bison, which once roamed most of the central United States but is now no longer found in Arkansas. On the other hand, it could also refer to a freshwater fish of the genus Ictiobus found in the lower Mississippi river valley.</field>

		<field name="content">Built by Mississippian Indians between 600 and 1300 AD, Cahokia was the largest prehistoric city in all of what became the United States. Then covering six sq mi (16 sq km), Cahokia was a melting pot of Indian groups. The city included large fields of corn, wooden houses for thousands of people, grand open plazas, and about 120 earthen mounds.  Though the city was abandoned in the 1300s, French and later American settlers arrived in the 17th and 18th century and again began growing crops. Even in the early 1800s, archeologists recognized that there was something unique here, but the land continued to be used for farming for the next 125 years. In the 1930s, the United States government considered making the site into a national park, but ultimately decided against the idea. The state of Illinois then purchased an initial plot of land including Monks Mound, and continues to expand and operate the park today through the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site remains one of the few World Heritage sites in the United States which is not run by the federal government.  Cahokia Mounds was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and named a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1982.</field>

		<field name="content">Human occupation in California goes back 50000 years; California was home to thirty different tribal groups prior to the arrival of European explorers in the 1500s and now over 120 tribes are left. The first Europeans were the Spanish and Portuguese, who built a settlement in California, establishing twenty-one missions in California by the late 1700s.  Many of these missions survive today, including that in  Santa Barbara .  After the Mexican War for Independence in 1821, California became a part of  Mexico  for 25 years until 1846 where it briefly became a sovereign nation, California Republic, before it was annexed by the United States in 1846.  In 1848 the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada mountains kicked off the California Gold Rush, and Californias non-native population surged from 15,000 to over 300,000 within two years.  California was recognized as a state in 1850, and its population increased steadily since then. Today California is the most populous state in the US with over 38 million residents.</field>

The state contains extremes in elevation, with  Mount Whitney  at 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) being the tallest mountain in the lower-48 states, while less than 200 miles away  Death Valley , at 282 feet (-82 meters) below sea level, is North Americas lowest point.  Californias border to the west is made up of a rugged coastline along the Pacific Ocean.  The coastal mountains rise up from the ocean and are home to redwood trees in the northern half.  The Central Valley bisects California from north-to-south before giving way to the Sierra Nevada mountains, home of  Yosemite National Park ,  Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks  and other natural wonders.  The southeastern part of California is dominated by desert, which covers 25% of Californias total area.  The Mojave is a high desert, with elevations ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level.  This area receives less than six inches of rain each year.</field>

He stayed with his friend, the Spanish Land grant holder Don Gonzales, at his house which was 15 miles north of the ceremony site, which was in downtown Pensacola. General Jacksons troops camped nearby, which gave the area its name - Cantonment - which means "temporary quarters for troops". the Main entrance to Pensacola from the north, U.S. Highway 29, runs through the town. Also noteworthy about the region is the fact that it lies in the narrowest part of the County between two large rivers, the Perdido and the Escambia. The Escambia River is the 4th largest river in the State of Florida and is considered the best fishing river by the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife.</field>

The Navajo were living in the canyon when the Spanish first arrived in the 1700s.  The next century was marked by repeated conflicts with the Spanish and other Indian tribes, and later with the US.  Finally, in 1864, Kit Carson led a campaign to remove the Navajo to Fort Sumner. Cold and hungry, most surrendered and began the Long Walk to Fort Sumner. After four years of hardship, the Navajo signed a treaty with the US, which established the reservation.  Presently a few dozen families live in the canyon at least part of the year, farming and herding.</field>

		<field name="content">Green River Overlook in the Island in the Sky district  From the 1880s to 1975, local ranchers used much of Canyonlands for winter pasture, constructing trails to move their stock across the rugged terrain. In the 1950s the growth of Americas nuclear arms program created a high demand for uranium.  To encourage prospectors, the Atomic Energy Commission offered monetary incentives and built almost 1,000 miles of road in southeast Utah. In Canyonlands, these roads include the popular White Rim Road at the Island in the Sky.  Though the region produced substantial amounts of uranium, miners discovered very little in what is now Canyonlands. However, the newly created roads led to other discoveries. For the first time, much of Canyonlands could be seen from a car. Tourism slowly increased as more people learned about the area’s geologic wonders. By opening canyon country to travel, the miners blazed the trail for the creation of a National Park.  In the 1950s and early 1960s, Arches National Monument Superintendent Bates Wilson advocated the creation of a National Park in what is now Canyonlands. On September 12, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 88-590 establishing Canyonlands National Park. Initially consisting of 257,640 acres, Congress expanded Canyonlands to its present size of 337,598 acres in 1971.</field>

Carved out of vast sedimentary rock deposits, this landscape of canyons, mesas, and deep river gorges possesses remarkable natural features that are part of a unique desert ecosystem.  Elevations within the park range from 3,700 to 7,200 feet above sea level.  The foundation of Canyonlands ecology is its remarkable geology, which is visible everywhere in cliff profiles that reveal millions of years of deposition and erosion. These rock layers continue to shape life in Canyonlands today, as their erosion influences elemental features like soil chemistry and where water flows when it rains.</field>

Other animals are most active during dawn and dusk hours and include mule deer, desert bighorn, coyotes, porcupines, desert cottontails, black-tailed jackrabbits, and many songbirds.  The handful of animals likely to be seen during the day include rock squirrels, antelope squirrels, chipmunks, lizards, snakes, hawks, and eagles.  Plants in the park include drought escapers (those which make use of favorable conditions when they exist) and drought resistors (those capable of growing with little water).  Drought escapers are usually annuals that grow only when enough water is available. Seeds may lie dormant for years if conditions are not favorable. Most grasses are escapers, as are wildflowers that bloom after seasonal rains during spring or late summer.  Drought resistors are typically perennials. Many have small, spiny leaves that reduce the impact of solar radiation, and some may drop their leaves if water is unavailable. Spines and hairy leaves act to reduce exposure to air currents and solar radiation, limiting the amount of water lost to evaporation. Cacti, yuccas and mosses are examples of drought resistors. Yuccas have extensive taproots that are able to use water beyond the reach of other plants. Moss, a plant not commonly associated with deserts, thrives because it can tolerate complete dehydration: when rains finally return, mosses green up immediately.</field>

The temperate (and most popular) seasons are spring (April through May) and fall (mid-September through October), when daytime highs average 60 to 80°F and lows average 30 to 50°F.  Summer temperatures often exceed 100°F, making strenuous exercise difficult. Late summer monsoon season brings violent storm cells which often cause flash floods.  Winters are cold, with highs averaging 30 to 50°F, and lows averaging 0 to 20°F. Though large snowfalls are uncommon (except in nearby mountains), even small amounts of snow or ice can make local trails and roads impassable.</field>

		<field name="content">Cape Cod is relatively young geologically at 18,000 years or so. American Indians began using the land at least 9,000 years ago.  In 1620, a group known as "The Pilgrims", a group of English Separatists seeking to establish a settlement in Virginia were forced to land here. They sent out three separate "discovery" expeditions to see what the area had to offer. During these "discoveries" they found their first fresh water, took some Indian corn, and almost had a battle (called the First Encounter) with some Native Americans. Cape Cod had many good features, but after a month of searching, it was decided to finally settle in  Plymouth .   In 1902 Guglielmo Marconi built one of two North American wireless stations at South Wellfleet. On January 18, 1903 the first public two-way communication (in Morse Code) between Europe and America occurred through this station. The station was closed in 1917 and scrapped in 1920, with the communication station being relocated to Chatham. Cable stations were later established in North Eastham and Orleans.  Seashore history also includes shipwrecks and lifesaving. Two lighthouses (Highland or "Cape Cod" and Nauset) have been moved to keep them from toppling down eroding cliffs.  The Cape Cod National Seashore was created on August 7th, 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.</field>

		<field name="content">From the 9th to 15th centuries, Native Americans of the Fremont Culture lived in and near the Waterpocket Fold.  They seem to have left the region around 1500 for unknown reasons.  Later, nomadic Ute and Southern Paiute tribes inhabited the area.  Explorer John C. Fremont passed through the northern part of what is now Capitol Reef in 1854.  The Fremont River that runs through the park is named after him.   White settlement came late to the area, in the 1870s, Latter Day Saints (Mormon) settlers moved into the high plateau lands west of Capitol Reef and established communities based on short-season farming and grazing.  In the 1880s Mormon settlers moved into Capitol Reef and established the community of Fruita along the banks of the Fremont River.  These settlers planted the fruit orchards along the river that still exist today.  No more than 10 families at any one time lived in the Fruita area.    The area was called "Wayne Wonderland" in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman, and in 1937, President Roosevelt set aside a portion of Wayne Wonderland as a National Monument. Funds for the park were scarce, however, and it would be a long time before the first rangers would arrive.  During the 1960s, a campground, visitor center and staff housing were built and a road through the park was paved.  During this period, most of the farmers in the area left and sold their land to the Park Service.  In 1968, a large amount of land was added to the park, increasing its size by almost 600%, and in 1971 the National Monument officially became Capitol Reef National Park.</field>

		<field name="content">Travellers to the park experience a dazzling landscape of rock formations.  From colorful domes, high cliffs, and towering spires of sandstone to arches, natural bridges, and narrow slot canyons.  The desert streams, such as the Fremont, wind through the Park, carving deep canyons and meandering through floodplains surrounded by narrow ribbons of greenery.  The Waterpocket Fold defines the Park.  A 100-mile long warp in the Earths crust, the Waterpocket Fold is a classic monocline: a regional fold with one very steep side in an area of otherwise nearly horizontal layers. A monocline is a "step-up" in the rock layers. The layers on the west side of the Fold have been lifted more than 7000 feet higher than those on the east.  The park was established primarily to preserve the geologic features of the Waterpocket Fold, such as the scenic rock domes and narrow canyons.  Capitol Reef is a geologists paradise, with nearly 10,000 feet of sedimentary layers ranging from 270 million to 80 million years old.  The Waterpocket Fold has tilted this geologic layer cake down to the east, with older rocks in the west and younger ones in the east.  Rock layers in Capitol Reef reveal ancient environments as varied as rivers and swamps (Chinle Formation), Sahara-like deserts (Navajo Sandstone), and shallow oceans (Mancos Shale).  These layers have been eroded by wind and especially water over the last 20 million years.  The land forms are a result of different responses of various rock layers to these forces of erosion. Hard sandstone layers form cliffs, while softer shale layers form slopes and low hills. Black boulders found scattered throughout the park are volcanic rocks from the 20 to 30 million year old lava flows which cap the nearby mountains.</field>

		<field name="content">The most visible plant life in the park is found in the riparian corridors near Fruita.  Along the rivers, you may see cottonwoods and willows as well as the invasive tamarisk.  Pioneer orchards along the Fremont River sport apple, apricot, pear, peach, and cherry trees.  In the dryer areas of the park, you may see sagebrush, Utah Juniper, various prickly pear cacti, and higher elevations may feature pinyon pine.  The cacti, along with some desert wildflowers, bloom briefly in the early spring.  Like many parts of the Utah desert, the nearly barren ground is covered with a biological soil crust, also known as cryptobiotic soil.  This collection of bacteria, moss and lichen helps to stabilize loose desert soils and retain precious moisture.  These crusts are very fragile, however, and should never be walked or driven on as they may take centuries to regenerate.  Do not leave established hiking trails, but if you must, walk in washes or on bare rock.  There are many animals in the park, but, like many desert creatures, they are far more active at night.  The park is home to many species of lizards, and a number of snakes.  Listen for the sound of Canyon Wrens in the narrow washes; they and many other birds make their home here.  Vultures, hawks and the introduced Chukar are common sights in the park.  You may be lucky enough to see some of the numerous bat species flying around Fruita in the evening.  Deer are an extremely common sight in the orchards and picnic area.  Though they may look tame, they are not.  Do not feed them or any other animal.  Other common large mammals include the Gray Fox, Raccoon, Ringtail, Badger, and Porcupine.  The once common Desert Bighorn Sheep were reintroduced in the late 1990s and are thriving.  Mountain Lions have also been reported in the park, but are rarely seen by visitors. If you do see one, do not approach it.</field>

		<field name="content">The Hall of Giants, in the Big Room  The Big Room is often described as the worlds largest cave chamber, but it no longer holds that title; the record-holding Sarawak Chamber in Lubang Nasib Bagus ("Good Luck Cave") in  Malaysia  is far larger, and as many as 10 other chambers are now known that are larger than the Big Room.  However, Carlsbad Caverns still offers world-class cave experiences by any reasonable definition.  The "Big Cave" (Carlsbad Cavern itself) is one of over 80 caves within the park, but it is neither the longest nor the deepest of the parks caves.  Both of these honors fall to Lechuguilla Cave, a "wild" cave not normally open to tourists.  The caves lie primarily within a Permian limestone reef, but one unusual feature of Carlsbad Caverns is that it is located atop a field of natural gas and oil.  As a result, the usual calcium-carbonate cave formations are supplemented in some areas by formations based on calcium sulfate (gypsum) created by the migration of sulfur-bearing water up from the gas field.  This, combined with a tendency for the limestone containing the bulk of the caves to fracture along massive joints, results in the unusual combination of very large cave passages and extremely ornate (although, in many cases, famously massive) decorations.  The calcium-sulfate formations tend to be delicate and are not usually visible to the casual visitor, but some of the backcountry caves (see under "Do") have astonishing calcium-sulfate formations.</field>

Practically every plant species in the park has spines or thorns on it, and the prickly-pear cactus, ocotillo and lechuguilla are widespread and difficult to hike through.  The caves themselves are the home of a distinctive fauna including cave crickets that have adapted to conditions of total darkness.  Raccoons, ring-tail cats, and skunks are often found around the cave entrances.  By far the best known park denizens, however, are the enormous colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats that live in the Big Cave and other caves (see below under "See").

Winters in the park are usually quite pleasant, with daytime highs around 60 to 65 degrees F (15 to 18 degrees C).  Precipitation is sparse, but often comes in the form of brief but incredibly intense summer thunderstorms that may drop up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain in a few hours.  There is occasional, non-persistent snow during the winters.  Spring and fall tend to have agreeable temperatures and little precipitation, although springtime winds can be unpleasant.</field>

		<field name="content">The Hohokam were a nation that lived in the south-central region of Arizona.  Their community was centered around large adobe structures.  For unknown reasons, the Hohokam abandoned their structures and left the region around 1450 CE.  The first written records of Casa Grade occurred in 1694.  With the advent of train travel, more people began to visit the site between the 1860s and 1880s.  During this period, souvenir hunting, graffiti, and vandalism took its toll on the site leading to the creation of the archaeological reserve.  In 1892, Casa Grande was the designated as the first archaeological reserve in the United States.  It was declared a National Monument in 1918.  To protect the structure from the elements, a wood-and-corrugated-iron shelter was built over it in 1903.  In 1932, the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed a more substantial steel shelter over the structure, which is still in use today.</field>

		<field name="title">Catskills</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Catskills began 350 million years ago as a river delta, absorbing the runoff from the Taconic Mountains to the northeast, then the tallest on the planet, as water drained into a shallow inland sea. At some point during that time, a meteorite one half-mile (1 km) wide struck the river delta; the resulting impact crater eventually formed Panther Mountain in western Ulster County, one of the ranges highest peaks, through a process known as "inverted relief." Eventually the Taconics eroded to what they are now, and the rivers and sea dried up. What had been their floors became the shales, sandstones and other sedimentary rock that makes up the bedrock of the range.  Continental drift and plate tectonics formed the Appalachian Mountains. Instead of breaking up into smaller mountains and hills, the Catskills rose up as a single landform, a process visible in the dramatic rise of the Catskill Escarpment from the Hudson Valley floor in Greene County. Over the next eons, streams draining uplifted rock carved out deep gaps. The Catskills are thus, in geological terms, a "maturely dissected plateau", rather than true mountains, although you would be forgiven if the distinction was lost when driving around them.  Stony Clove Notch, carved by glacial meltwater  In the last million years, the various Ice Ages further shaped the mountains. The glaciers themselves were thick enough to cover all the mountains, save 4,180-foot (1,277 m) Slide, in the Ulster County town of Shandaken, the ranges highest peak. The scouring under centuries of ice had some effects, the most significant of which may have been to remove any coal that might have settled there. But it was the lakes left behind as the glaciers melted which left us with the range as we know it today, the rushing meltwaters carving out the dramatic gaps like Stony Clove Notch and Kaaterskill Clove.  The first humans who came kept going. While the Iroquois who settled in Southern New York found routes through the mountains to the rest of their nation, and hunted there, they found the Hudson Valley a more amenable place to settle due to its more fertile soils and milder climate. It was there that they met Henry Hudson and the crew of the Halve Maen, journeying up the river that would be named for him in 1609.  Wars between the Dutch and the English kept most settlers for venturing into the mountains for the rest of the century. It was not until 1708, well after English rule had been established, that Lord Cornbury, the colonial governor, granted the Hardenbergh Patent, covering most of what is today considered the Catskills. Subdividing and selling the land, however, proved difficult. The Iroquois, as well as the few squatters in the region, disrupted the survey to the point of unreliability, and as the century wore on there were increasing questions about the validity of the deal, given the Cornburys well-deserved reputation for corruption and the patentees willingness to enrich themselves by selling shares despite all these issues. It took until the middle of the century for all the land to be subdivided and settlement to begin.  Nevertheless the Catskills came to the attention of the wider public, if only through scientific research. Swedish botanist Peter Kalm passed through the region on his journeys to Niagara Falls, noting some of the species he found. One was "balm of Gilead fir", today known as balsam fir and mostly found only on higher summits in the range. Philadelphia botanist John Bartram went to the North-South Lake area with his son to collect some seeds of the tree for correspondents in London. His 1753 account of the trip, "A Journey to Ye Cat Skill Mountains with Billy", was widely read both in the colonies and England.  Most early settlers were tenants, who held their lands under a quasi-feudal arrangement known as the "three-life lease", by which a father, son, and then grandson could theoretically take title to their land if the three generations were able to pay for it. In practice this rarely happened, and even after a pro-British tenant uprising against their independence-minded landlords was put down at the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the many Anti-rent wars continued until a new state constitution abolished those leases in 1840.  The Catskill Mountain House, ca. 1836  With the regions politics finally settled, its economy began to shake out. It was built around two industries—tourism and tanbarking–that would shape it into the 20th century. The first began with the Catskill Mountain House hotel, near North-South Lake in the Greene County town of Hunter. Hotelier Charles Beach marketed the spectacular views over the valley from the Escarpment after taking over sole control in the 1820s, and by the Civil War presidents, artists and other visiting dignitaries and celebrities were visiting "Americas First Wilderness", where other hotels, some on mountaintops, had been built as well.  Deeper in the mountains, barkpeelers went into the abdundant forests looking for the many large groves of Eastern hemlock. They sought not the wood itself, useful for some pieces of furniture but little else, but the reddish bark. When stripped from a sufficiently mature tree and boiled, it yielded quality tannin for the tanning process essential to making leather. The woods yielded enough bark that most of the leather holsters issued to Union Army officers during the Civil War were tanned in the Catskills. Other than bluestone used in making sidewalks, it was the only exploitable resource the mountains yielded.  In 1879 a guest at the Mountain House, Princeton geology professor Arnold Henri Guyot, took note of the many mountains to the west and southwest visible from the peaks near the hotel. It was already known that, contrary to Beachs publicity materials, nearby Kaaterskill High Peak, which had graced so many Hudson River School paintings, was not the ranges highest peak. Guyot wondered what was, and in his spare time returned to the Catskills with a survey team. They became the first to record ascents of many of the ranges highest summits, and in 1885 stunned the Escarpment hoteliers with the revelation that the highest peak in the range was, in fact, Slide Mountain, located 20 miles to the southwest in the Ulster County town of Shandaken.  The same year, politicians in that county had grown sick of dealing with an expensive problem resulting in part from tanbarking. Once they had stripped the good trees, the barkpeelers often left the land behind; while they reaped the profits, the land defaulted to the county, and by law they were responsible for property taxes owed to the state. The increasing costs incurred were beginning to strain the countys coffers, and when they could not get a reprieve their representatives in the state legislature found an even better solution. Earlier that year the legislature had designated certain state lands in the  Adirondacks  to be the state Forest Preserve, "forever kept as wild forest lands." They had the lands with the tax delinquencies transferred to the state as payment in full of the outstanding debts ... and nothing in the Catskills would be the same afterwards.  Slowly the quarrying and barkpeeling industries ebbed, done in by the development of cheaper synthetic materials and processes. The hotels around North-South Lake, too, went into decline as their founders died. In their place came those drawn to the newly protected land, especially after the legislature drew the "Blue Line" in 1902, creating the Catskill Park. John Burroughs, a native of Delaware County who became one of the eras leading nature writers, devoted some of his most memorable essays to his journeys into the Catskill wilderness, including one of the earliest accounts of an ascent of Slide.  Another writer was Theodore Gordon, who went to live in the mountains during the 1890s to fight off his tuberculosis infection. To pass the time, he began fishing, and made some money writing about his experiences for Field Stream. The remote headwaters of streams like the Beaver Kill had been quietly known for years outside the region as brimming with trout, and farmers had been living off the fisheries for years. Gordon not only popularized them, he revolutionized American angling when he introduced the dry fly, developed in Britain to imitate a surface insect, as a lure. Later anglers refined techniques and developed new flies, and thousands follow in their footsteps annually, wading into the cool clear creeks and rivers looking to land a trout to remember.  Ashokan Reservoir  The waters also interested New York City, which had begun to outgrow its Westchester-based supply network at the end of the 20th century. The city looked all the way to the Catskills, where the "forever wild" language, added to the 1894 state constitution as Article XIV, protected the watersheds of streams like the Esopus and Schoharie creeks. A protracted legal and political struggle over the lands to be condemned led to the 1915 opening of Ashokan Reservoir in central Ulster County, the first of what are now six serving the city.  The city was home to another group of people that would redefine the Catskills. Jewish immigrants in the city, at the time banned from most established resorts, began spending summers in boardinghouses at the farms of their co-religionists in the lower Catskills, where they could at least keep kosher. Those boardinghouses and bungalow colonies gradually grew into resorts of their own like Grossingers and the Concord, the nucleus of the "Borscht Belt", where dozens of entertainers would hone their skills and launch careers that took them to far greater heights. That era passed when laws ended religious discrimination, although many ultra-Orthodox Hasidim still relocate to the region for the summer. Today the large resorts are closed, and most of the smaller buildings gone, but the memories have been captured in films like Dirty Dancing, Mr. Saturday Night and A Walk on the Moon.  As the Borscht Belt era was ending, in 1969, the event that would redefine the Catskills for the present generation took place. Late that summer, thousands of the eras hippies gathered on a dairy farm near the Sullivan County town of Bethel for "three days of peace, love and music" from some of the eras top acts such as Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; The Who, Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix. While the festival was actually declared a disaster area, launching scores of lawsuits, and many of the performances were subpar, the Woodstock festival gave the baby-boom generation a name and a spiritual touchstone for years afterwards, as many claimed to be there who had not been.  And it continues to frame the region today. Its most evident in the town of Woodstock, miles from the festival site, but throughout the modern Catskills youll find a focus on the artsy and the spiritual, with retreats focusing on Eastern religion and New Age mysticism drawing outsiders to the region in the summer. Older communities hold on, too, even after the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011, damage which can still be seen in many places, particularly the Greene County village of Prattsville. And the hikers and fishermen continue to flock to the trails and streams, rich with the history of their sports, not only in the summer but most of the year.</field>

		<field name="content">New York City gets the bulk of its water from the Catskills for a very good reason: the region, in particularly the area around Slide Mountain, is the rainiest in the state. But thats not the only thing that stands out.  Damage caused by flooding after Hurricane Irene in 2011  As an elevated mountainous plateau, the Catskill climate differs from its neighboring, lower regions. Summers are generally pleasant and cooler than elsewhere (why else would so many residents of the metropolitan area come to the mountains for long periods during that season?) although the experience of Irene has been a sobering reminder that the region is not some isolated mountain idyll beyond the reach of natures fury.  After summer gives way to the shorter days and festive colors of fall and its leaf-peeping highlights, winter comes. And thats a different story. The first snows have been known to accumulate on higher summits in early November, before hunting season even starts. With much of the region at least 2,000 feet (600 m) above sea level, there is usually plenty of snow and, in a typical winter, at least a few nights with temperatures several degrees below 0º F (-17º C). The ski areas nevertheless maintain ample snowmaking facilities.  As February turns to March and saplines string trees to each other, gaps start to appear in the snow cover. While some white areas have lingered into early May in shaded areas of the summits, in the valleys its all gone by the April 1 opening of trout season. From then to Memorial Day, spring gradually creeps up the slopes, just in time for another glorious Catskill summer.</field>

		<field name="content">The Catskills: From Wilderness to Woodstock, (Alf Evers, 1982). Few regions can be said to have a single, authoritative history written about them as this magnum opus. Essentially the long (and, at 700+ pages, it is long) version of the history above, it covers everything important thats happened in the region from colonial times to the era of its writing. Evers, a folkorist by training who grew up on an Ulster County farm, pays special attention to the regions legends and the views of its ordinary people. The result is a multigenerational epic that rivals any science fiction or fantasy franchise. The Catskill Mountain House (Roland van Zandt, 1966). Somewhat overtaken by the scope of Evers later work, this history of the regions signature resort was one of the earliest efforts to rediscover the rich history of the Catskills. Features some of the last pictures taken of the ruined building, by the author, before the state razed it in 1965. It Happened in the Catskills: An Oral History in the Words of Busboys, Bellhops, Guests, Proprietors, Comedians, Agents, and Other Who Lived It, (Myrna Katz and Harvey Frommer, 2009). There had been many books and memoirs written about summer in the Borscht Belt, but until this no real attempt to tell the whole story. Maybe it doesnt, but the many voices tell a grand enough story as it is.</field>

The overlooked 1996 comedy-drama Manny Lo, starring Scarlett Johansen, is worth watching as a cinematic introduction to the region. Not only is it set in the wilder areas of Ulster and Greene counties, it was actually shot at recognizable locations such as Devils Tombstone campground.</field>

		<field name="content">The wild and rugged land compromising  the area where Cedar Breaks lies today was known to 1800 Mormon settlers as “Breaks,” due to how difficult it was to travel in the area.  In the 1920’s Iron and Kane Counties worked together to have a road constructed from Cedar City to Highway 89.  A paved road up to Cedar Breaks was also built. President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Cedar Breaks a National Monument on August 22, 1933.  The monument is managed today by the National Park Service. In the summer of 2006 parties have worked to have this outstanding monument become a National Park.</field>

This is a high elevation monument however and although there are junipers, there are many more aspen and spruce.  Due to the spruce beetle however, a live and thriving spruce tree is becoming a rare sight. The fir beetle has been doing some damage on the mountain lately as well. The bristlecone pine and fir trees dots the landscape in many places in the monument.  The bristlecone is thought to be the oldest living thing in the world even though the Aspen, according to some scientists, might just be older.  At 10,000 feet the fauna living on the mountain must be hardy.  Seen around the monument are deer, squirrels, chipmunks, pika and gophers.</field>

		<field name="content">The Chaco dwellings were built and occupied primarily between about 850 and 1250 AD, during which time they were the hub of a remarkable network of transportation routes, many of which survive today as the "roads" of Chaco.  They fell into disuse after 1300, probably due to climate change, although descendants of the Chacoans and other tribes remained aware of the ancestral pueblos.  The present park was one of the first units of the National Park System to be formed specifically to protect archaeological resources, being first formed as Chaco Canyon National Monument in 1907 (shortly after  Mesa Verde National Park , which also started as a national monument rather than a park).  The monument achieved national-park status in 1980 and Pueblo Bonito became a  UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 1987.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">landscape</field>
		<field name="content">Chaco is in canyon/mesa country, like most of northwestern New Mexico, but the topography in the park isnt as spectacular as in some other areas of the state; the visitor center, in the canyon bottom, is at an elevation of about 6200 feet, and the surrounding mesas rise only about 400 feet above this level.  The canyon is wide and open for most of its length, unlike the narrow "slot canyons" to the northwest in  Utah .  This, of course, is why theres a park here: the openness of the canyon provided enough room to build the pueblos and grow crops.  Note that this elevation is high enough to challenge the lungs of the visitor freshly up from sea level.  You may find yourself a bit short of breath when hiking, so if youre going to be there overnight, its recommended that you do the "easy" trails along the main loop first to get acclimatized somewhat, then the longer, more vertical backcountry trails on your second day.  Most of the rock comprising the mesas as well as the canyon floor is sedimentary, and consequently tends toward flat bedding planes that are interrupted by relatively few faults and folds.  As a result, one of the hiking challenges is that the transition between individual geological formations along the canyon walls  can be steep.  This is incentive to stay on the constructed trails in the backcountry; youll want to do that anyway, as off-trail hiking is generally prohibited and the prohibition is enforced.  One of the signature features of Chaco is Fajada Butte near the south entrance.  This narrow, steep-walled butte rises about 400 feet above the canyon and is notable for artifacts including the "Sun Dagger," interpreted by some as an astronomical observatory/clock used by the Chacoans to keep track of annual progress toward the summer solstice.  Fajada Butte is no longer open to hikers, but a roadside turnout near the south entrance leads to a viewpoint from which it can be seen and photographed to good advantage.</field>

		<field name="content">Chaco has high-desert flora, with sagebrush, cactus, etc., interspersed with small bits of piñon/juniper scrub forest, the latter primarily on the mesa tops.  Chaco receives less precipitation (average 8 inches per year) than some other parts of New Mexico at similar latitude and elevation, and consequently does not have the coniferous forest of some areas to its east.  Plant life is generally sparse.  Animal life too is not as abundant as elsewhere in the state, but wildlife encounters are still reasonably frequent.  The largest animal youre likely to see is the ubiquitous coyote, although you may also see a deer or two.  Elk and antelope are present in the region but rarely encountered in the park.  Smaller carnivores such as bobcat, badger, fox and two species of skunk are sometimes seen, and rodents are locally abundant, with a few prairie-dog towns in the park.  Small colonies of bats are present during the summer.  The shortage of water reduces the prevalence of bird life as well, but Chaco is still an island of at least relative avian abundance and diversity in this region.  With luck youll see a roadrunner or two, but dont count on it; theyre rare here.  The usual assortment of medium to large hawks (Coopers hawk and kestrel are fairly common), owls (more often heard than seen), vultures and raven are present, if less abundant than in the mountains to the east.  There are reasonably large populations of smaller birds, with warblers, sparrows, house finches, etc., common.  Three species of hummingbirds are at hand, and one of the treats of late summer is watching the tiny but incredibly pugnacious rufous hummingbirds chasing off the larger, mellower black-chinned hummers that compete with the rufous for habitat.  Its like watching a World War I aerial dogfight in miniature.  Rufous hummers are rare in the park, however, and youll be lucky to get this visual treat.  Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, but youre much more likely to see various lizards scurrying along the tops of restored walls of structures, with skinks being fairly abundant.</field>

		<field name="content">Chaco, like most of northwestern New Mexico, has a high desert climate with four distinct seasons.  Spring is dry and windy, with high temperatures rising rapidly from an average of 60 degrees Fahrenheit or so in March to over 80 F in June.  Summer is hot, with highs frequently above 90 F, and with much of the average years precipitation falling in isolated, brief but violent thunderstorms.  However, its the legendary "dry heat" that doesnt feel nearly as hot as in regions with higher humidity.  Cooling starts in August and leads to a dry, temperate fall season that is usually a good time to visit Chaco.  Winter is also pleasant with highs around 50 F and clear skies, although there are usually three or four frontal storms each winter that bring snow, usually in small quantities but with the occasional major snowstorm.  The remoteness of the park is such that its a good idea to check a weather forecast before visiting in the winter;  Farmington , about 60 miles away, usually experiences similar weather, and its current conditions and forecast are updated regularly.  If theres significant snow (say 6" or more) in the forecast, its wise to defer your trip unless youre particularly well prepared for snowy roads.</field>

		<field name="content">The creek valley at Charlestown is one of the oldest unglaciated streams in the state. Even though the stream was this way, melting water from northern glaciers helped shaped the streams deep valleys. The trip down Fourteenmile Creek shows the effects of the Ohio River on it and how it is the same elevation as the Ohio due to dams and locks along the Ohio. When the Ohio rises, Fourteenmile seems to be reversing in its flow due to the water backing up.   The park was used as the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant for 50 years, ending in 1995. The park used to also have a turn of the century amusement park called Rose Island.</field>

In many ways, the city is still trying to catch up to its own growth; visitors often comment that it seems understated in terms of culture and development. However, it is changing at a breathtaking speed. A very rapid influx of population and business investment has given it one of the most dynamic urban areas in the region.</field>

		<field name="content">This statue near the Uptown Holiday Inn honors Charlottes namesake.   Charlottes earliest settlers were Presbyterians of Scots-Irish descent who built a small courthouse, marketplace and village at the intersection of ancient Native American trading paths (the actual intersection is the Square formed by Trade and Tryon Streets) during the middle of the 18th Century. Both Charlotte and Mecklenburg County were named in honor of the Germanic wife of King George III of England. In addition, the main thoroughfare (Tryon St.) was named in tribute to the English Governor of the day. The establishment of a courthouse made Charlotte the seat of Mecklenburg County, and it was known for little more in its early days.</field>

		<field name="content">Charlottes early residents were fiercely independent, in accordance with their rural Protestant heritage. The city was known as a hotbed of separatism well prior to the American Revolution, culminating in the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence (signed a year prior to the American equivalent). The Square was the site of a minor skirmish with Cornwallis army, which led to the citys characterization as a "hornets nest" of rebellion. Nevertheless, the city remained a relatively obscure village, and was dubbed a "trifling place" by visiting President George Washington.</field>

		<field name="content">The first signs of economic prosperity came to Charlotte with the discovery of a huge gold nugget at the site of modern-day Reeds Gold Mine. This triggered the United States first gold rush, and dotted Mecklenburg County with gold mines. The mines contributed low-grade gold to the citys street-paving program, which led to the joke that the streets were literally paved with gold in Charlotte. Eventually the city earned the establishment of a U.S. Mint for currency production on modern-day Mint St. Perhaps most importantly, the city positioned itself as a railroad hub. With several lines intersecting in Charlotte, the city became a major destination for farmers wishing to distribute their tobacco and cotton crops nationwide. These events presaged Charlottes future as a city of commerce and distribution.</field>

The city contributed troops to the Confederate effort, many of whom are buried in the Confederate graveyard at modern-day Elmwood Cemetery. Curiously, landlocked Charlotte briefly became the home to the Confederate Naval Yard near the end of the war, as a result of its railroad connections. Also, the city was host to the final full meeting of the Confederate Cabinet, and Jefferson Davis was standing on Tryon St when informed of Lincolns assassination (Davis widow later retired to Charlotte). Generally, though, Charlotte was fortunate to play a relatively minor role in the devastating conflict. Its main casualty was the loss of the Mint, which was shut down for obvious reasons by the Union government.</field>

		<field name="content">Charlotte has been noted as one of the Souths most resilient cities in the wake of the Civil War. Having been spared the widespread destruction of cities such as Atlanta and Columbia, Charlotte was relatively free of obligations to rebuild infrastructure. It jumped quickly onto the "New South" bandwagon, increasing its ties to the railroads and mill industry. Some of the major mills established here after the War are still standing, and have mostly been converted into modern businesses and condominiums. Perhaps most importantly, Charlotte was a site of heavy financial investment by "carpetbaggers" (northern transplants who were eyed with suspicion or outright hostility). These upstart banks were the predecessors to Charlottes modern banking giants.</field>

		<field name="content">At the turn of the century, Charlotte was still a small town in spite of its favorable position. But by the 1950s, it had exploded into the largest city in the Carolinas. Aggressive businessmen transformed the city into a financial juggernaut, and the distribution industry made a smooth transition from the railroad-dominated 19th century into the automotive 20th century. As the local textile and furniture industries faltered, Charlotte invested its energy into finance and transportation, enabling it to avoid the depressions suffered in many other Carolinas cities. By the 1970s, the city was into a full-scale economic boom. The population skyrocketed with immigration from around the USA and foreign countries. The city skyline began to transform as office towers sprouted on an almost yearly basis, and the suburbs pushed farther toward the county borders. By the end of the century, Charlotte had transformed from mill town into metropolis.</field>

		<field name="content">It could be said that Charlottes greatest struggle is with its own identity. The city remains tied to its roots as a giant of finance and transportation, but has diversified as it has grown. The rapid growth of the late-20th century lead to the unfortunate demolition of much of the citys historical infrastructure, giving Uptown a glittering feeling of newness despite its 250-year history. The city continues to focus on the development of its core, despite the explosion of suburban communities out of Mecklenburg County and into surrounding towns. One thing is definite, though: all indications are that the city will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, making it one of the United States most prominent metro areas in the next decade.</field>

Like most Southern cities, Charlotte has a large African-American population. Also, it has a significant community of Asian descent, and a very rapidly growing Hispanic population. What was once a white-and-black city has become increasingly colorful with each passing decade.</field>

		<field name="content">Charlottes physical arrangement reflects the growth trends of the 20th Century. Like most Southern American cities, it is "sprawled" over a relatively wide area for its size. Most of the city is suburban in nature, and most of those suburbs are less than 50 years old although some nearby towns such as Mint Hill date back well into the 1700s. These suburbs are encircled by the partially-completed I-485.   However, unlike many of its peers, Charlotte has a very dense urban core that functions as an axis for its business and cultural life. The center of the city is therefore the primary destination for tourists and business travelers.   What is often lost in this arrangement is a diverse, colorful ring of "inner suburbs" that lie in the zone between the core and the new suburban development. Most of Charlottes most unique neighborhoods lie in this ring, as well as most of the citys "underground" activity. As a result, these areas have a highly local flavor and are just beginning to be discovered by tourists.</field>

Charlotte receives 43.52 in (1105.3nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually, most of which is in the form of rain (though there is some snow and ice in the winter). Charlotte is not as well equipped for snow and ice as more northerly cities; significant accumulations of snow (more than 2nbsp;cm) or ice on the roads can disrupt activity city-wide. Usually, this includes the closing of local businesses and schools, and happens about once a year on average. Charlottes inland location usually protects it from being hit directly from Atlantic hurricanes (the most recent exception being Hurricane Hugo in 1989), though it often receives heavy rains due to passing tropical systems.</field>

		<field name="content">Technically part of Uptown, the four Wards were the original political divisions of the city.  The axis that determines their boundaries is located along Trade and Tryon St., but few people consider the canyon of skyscrapers at the center of the city to really be identifiable as part of the Wards.  Each Ward has its own distinct personality:  First Ward -- Very heavily residential, but beginning to feed commercially off ambitious projects such as the light rail and arena. This area was almost entirely public housing for several decades, but was redeveloped with great success as a mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhood. Now it is a vibrant and well-kept neighborhood that seems quaint against the backdrop of skyscrapers nearby, and its attractiveness is verified by several major residential developments in the near future.   Second Ward -- Currently the citys government center, this area was the victim of a short-sighted urban renewal project in the 1960s. Previously, it had been the Brooklyn neighborhood: a largely impoverished but self-sufficient African-American district that was deemed unsightly and dangerous by city planners. Today, Second Ward is by far the most lifeless quarter of Uptown after working hours, as government workers disperse quickly and head to other parts of the city to live and play. A good place to find parking at night, but a bit of a social vacuum that can be a bit isolated.  Third Ward -- Unfortunately, much of Third Ward was lost to the decline of industry in the center city, but what is left still largely reflects a very blue-collar industrial heritage. Bank of America Stadium (home of the Panthers) is the Wards most recognizable symbol, though a new park and a proposed baseball stadium have provided good reason to believe that this may be a major center of growth in coming years. Third Wards largest current development is the gleaming Gateway Village, home to many offices and the Johnson and Wales University campus. Straddling W. Trade St. between Third and Fourth Wards, Gateway Village is one of the citys most bustling areas during the daytime.   Fourth Ward -- The best-preserved part of Uptown, Fourth Ward is host to Charlottes only remaining Queen Anne architecture.  Shady streets and brick sidewalks make for some of the citys best walking, and the homes in this district are the object of envy.  Fourth Ward Park is at the center of the neighborhood, and is a common ground for all kinds of city-dwellers. Several major condo projects have been proposed for this area, which will further densify it in the near future.</field>

		<field name="content">The construction of Chesapeake and Ohio Canal started on July 4, 1828 and lasted for 22 years. The canal was completed on October 10, 1850 at a cost of about $14 million. The canal was 184.5 miles long, 6 feet deep and 60-80 feet wide. There were 74 lift locks built on the canal, 7 dams and 11 aqueducts. One of the most impressive features of the canal, the Paw Paw Tunnel is 3,118 feet long; 27 feet wide and 24 feet high. The canal was in operation from 1850 to 1924. In 1938 the government acquired the approximately 12,000 acres of land adjacent to the canal and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park was established in 1971.  Today the park is open to the public and in two locations visitors can take a mule-drawn canal boat ride, driven by historical re-enactors.</field>

Starting in the colonial neighborhood of Georgetown in  Washington, D.C. , the canal passes old warehouses used for coal, now converted into malls, shops, architectural firms, condos and more. The canal is flanked by wide sandy paths (called towpaths) for biking, walking, and jogging, and its water is still and green. In Georgetown a number of shops and restaurants open onto the canal towpath.  On a nice day, the paths are full of people. Walk through the forest to the south just a few yards, and the mighty, rough Potomac River will roar in your ears. The Potomac is wide, fast, filled with boulders in and on the sides of the river, and surrounded by the dense woods that are the natural environment of the  Mid-Atlantic . Views of the  Virginia  sides cliffs (closer to  Washington, D.C. ) can be especially pretty, rising above the rocky shore. Given that the canal runs alongside the river, the trails are mostly level.</field>

		<field name="content">You wouldnt guess it, but the CO Canal National Park is one of the most biologically diverse in the national park system. The diverse landscapes of wetlands, streams, the river, forests, open fields, and rocky cliffs make for habitats for all sorts of plants and wildlife. Look in the mud beneath your feet and youll find frogs, toads, salamanders, fish, freshwater mussels, beaver, and muskrats. Around in the woods, there are deer, song birds, red and gray fox, raccoons, gray and fox squirrels, and even the rare black bear and bobcat! Look to the skies for the most famous bird in this country, the bald eagle, which nests along the river alongside rocky cliffs, and is actually quite common along the river.  Be careful when wandering off the path, and avoid picking at the vegetation, because the CO Canal is home to an extraordinary variety of rare, threatened, and endangered plant species. The region has so much rare plant life because of its idiosyncratic geography. The Potomac cuts through  Maryland , known as "America in Miniature" for its radical shifts in geography from east to west. The Potomac cuts through the rolling woodland plateaus of central Maryland, then the Blue Ridge mountains, and further on the valleys of Appalachia, providing diversity of habitats for the plant life. This factor combines with the frequent flooding of the river, and the overlap in Southern and Northern species to make for very diverse and unique environments for plants to grow.</field>

The only season that sees extremes is summer, when the temperature can rise as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but even then the presence of the big river has a cooling effect. Spring is the loveliest time of the year here, as the wildflowers and dogwood trees show their colors every which way, among budding trees. Fall is a close second, due to the fact that the park is almost completely covered with colorful deciduous trees. Winter is a surprisingly good time to visit, because temperatures rarely drop below freezing, and because youll have the park to yourself! And so do the animals, who shyly wander out into the open during the winter (since there are few people around to scare them off), and this is the best time of year to spot the rarer and harder to find species, like raccoons, muskrats, and the extremely rare bobcats. Summer is fun in its own festive way, as families set up picnics, bikers speed by, and all sorts of people converge on the park to check out its historic attractions and natural attractions like Great Falls.</field>

		<field name="content">Insider tip: Winter + Snow + Wind = Chicago.  Weather is definitely not one of the attractions in Chicago. Theres a good time to be had in any season, but it is a place where the climate has to be taken into consideration.  A little-known fact: despite Chicagos winters, there are more days with a maximum temperature of between 80-84°F (27-29°C) than any other five-degree range. Obscured by Chicagos ferocious winters are the heat waves of summer. The days in July and August that go above the "normal" are oftentimes disgustingly hot and humid, dewpoints can be similar to those found closer to the Gulf of Mexico. Summer nights are usually reasonable, though, and youll get a few degrees respite along the lakefront — in the local parlance, thats "cooler by the lake."  But then there are those winters. The months from December to March will see very cold temperatures, with even more bitter wind chill factors. Snow is usually limited to a handful of heavy storms per season, with a few light dustings in-between. (And a little more along the lakefront — again in the local parlance, thats "lake effect snow".) Ice storms are also a risk. Its a city thats well-accustomed to these winters, though, so city services and public transportation are highly unlikely to shut down.  That said, Chicago does have a few nice months of weather. May and September are pleasant and mild; April and June are mostly fine, although thunderstorms with heavy winds can also occur suddenly. Although there may be a slight chill in the air in October, it rarely calls for more than a light coat and some days thats not even necessary. In some years, the warmth stored by the lake may prolong a pleasant autumn into November.</field>

		<field name="content">Chicago literature found its roots in the citys tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of social realism. Consequently, most notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check. Here is a selection of Chicagos most famous works about itself:  Karen Abbotts Sin in the Second City is a recent best-seller about Chicagos vice district, the Levee, and some of the personalities involved: gangsters, corrupt politicians, and two sisters who ran the most elite brothel in town. Nelson Algrens Chicago: City on the Make is a prose poem about the alleys, the El tracks, the neon and the dive bars, the beauty and cruelty of Chicago. Its best saved for after a trip, when at least twenty lines will have you enraptured in recognition. Saul Bellows Adventures of Augie March charts the long drifting life of a Jewish Chicagoan and his myriad eccentric acquaintances throughout the early 20th century: growing up in the then Polish neighborhood of  Humboldt Park , cavorting with heiresses on the  Gold Coast , studying at the University of Chicago, fleeing union thugs in the  Loop , and taking the odd detour to hang out with Trotsky in  Mexico  while eagle-hunting giant iguanas on horseback. This book has legitimate claim to be the Chicago epic (for practical purposes, that means you wont finish it on the plane). Gwendolyn Brooks A Street in Bronzeville was the collection of poems that launched the career of the famous Chicago poetess, focused on the aspirations, disappointments, and daily life of those who lived in 1940s  Bronzeville . It is long out of print, so youll likely need to read these poems in a broader collection, such as her Selected Poems. Sandra Cisneros The House on Mango Street is a Mexican-American coming-of-age novel, dealing with a young Latina girl, Esperanza Cordero, growing up in the Chicago Chicano ghetto. Theodore Dreisers Sister Carrie is a cornerstone of the turn of the 20th century Chicago Literary Renaissance, a tale of a country girl in the big immoral city, rags-to-riches and back again. Stuart Dybeks The Coast of Chicago is a collection of fourteen marvelous short stories about growing up in Chicago (largely in  Pilsen  and  Little Village ) in a style blending the gritty with the dreamlike. John Guzlowskis Lightning and Ashes chronicles the authors experiences growing up in the immigrant and DP neighborhoods around  Humboldt Park  in Chicago, talking about Jewish hardware store clerks with Auschwitz tattoos on their wrists, Polish cavalry officers who still mourned for their dead horses, and women who walked from Siberia to Iran to escape the Russians. Erik Larsons Devil in the White City is a best-selling pop history about the 1893 Colombian Exposition; its also about the serial killer who was stalking the city at the same time. For a straight history of the Exposition and also the workers paradise in Pullman, try James Gilberts excellent Perfect Cities: Chicagos Utopias of 1893. Audrey Niffeneggers The Time-Travelers Wife is a recent love story set in Chicago nightclubs, museums, and libraries. Mike Roykos Boss is the definitive biography of Mayor Richard J. Daley and politics in Chicago, written by the beloved late Tribune columnist. American Pharaoh (Cohen and Taylor) is a good scholarly treatment of the same subject. Carl Sandburgs Chicago Poems is without a doubt the most famous collection of poems about Chicago by its own "bard of the working class." Upton Sinclairs The Jungle sits among the canon of both Chicago literature and US labor history for its muckraking-style depiction of the desolation experienced by Lithuanian immigrants working in the Union Stockyards on Chicagos  Southwest Side . Richard Wrights Native Son is a classic Chicago neighborhood novel set in  Bronzeville  and  Hyde Park  about a young, doomed, black boy hopelessly warped by the racism and poverty that defined his surroundings.</field>

		<field name="content">Hold on to your baby carriages in Union Station!   Chicago is Americas third most prolific movie industry and a host of very Chicago-centric movies have been produced here. These are just a few:   Ferris Buellers Day Off (John Hughes, 1986). The dream of the northern suburbs: to be young, clever, and loose for a day in Chicago. Ferris and friends romp through the old Loop theater district, catch a game at Wrigley Field, and enjoy the sense of invincibility that Chicago shares with its favorite sons when all is well.  Adventures in Babysitting (Chris Columbus, 1987). The flip side of Ferris Bueller — the dangers that await the suburbanite in the Loop at night, including memorable trips to lower Michigan Avenue and up close with the Chicago skyline.  The Blues Brothers (John Landis, 1980). Probably Chicagos favorite movie about itself: blues music, white men in black suits, a mission from God, the conscience that every Chicago hustler carries without question, and almost certainly the biggest car chase ever filmed.  The Untouchables (Brian De Palma, 1987). With a square-jawed screenplay by David Mamet, this is a retelling of Chicagos central fable of good vs. evil: Eliot Ness and the legendary takedown of Al Capone. No film (except perhaps The Blues Brothers) has made a better use of so many Chicago locations, especially Union Station (the baby carriage), the Chicago Cultural Center (the rooftop fight), and the LaSalle Street canyon.  High Fidelity (Stephen Frears, 2000). John Cusack reviews failed relationships from high school at Lane Tech to college in Lincoln Park and muses over them in trips through Uptown, River North, all over the city on the CTA, his record store in the rock snob environs of Wicker Park, and returning at last to his record-swamped apartment in Rogers Park.  Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, 2005) and its sequel The Dark Knight (2008). Making spectacular use of the L, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, Chicago skyscrapers, the Loop at night, and lower Wacker Drive, the revived action series finally sets the imposing power and intractable corruption of Gotham City where it belongs, in Chicago.  Others include Harrison Ford vs. the one-armed man in The Fugitive, the CTA vs. true love in While You Were Sleeping, Autobots vs. Decepticons in Transformers 3, the greatest Patrick Swayze hillbilly ninja vs. Italian mob film of all time, Next of Kin, and the humble John Candy film Only The Lonely which captures the south side Irish mentality and the comfort of neighborhood dive bars.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Chimney Rock has had a lot of history in its existence. Before the rock was just one, it was a large bluff connected with a series of bluffs right next to it. It was part of the ancient High Plains. After a while, erosion destroyed the weaker parts of the bluff and the stronger parts stayed such as Chimney Rock. For hundreds of years, Native Americans used the rock formation to kill and chase buffalo down it. It is believed that when the Native Americans used it, the rock was almost as tall as the nearby  Scotts Bluff National Monument , which is 830 ft. tall. It is also believed that since the Native Americans called the rock "teepee", it used to be in the form of a mountain peak and erosion wore it down to make it look like a spire. Through the years, though, erosion weakened the rock and made it smaller. In the 1800s, emigrants began traveling west for a better life on the Oregon and Mormon Trails. As the emigrants passed by this rock, most of them noted in their diaries or journals that they "were glad to see that they are going the right direction" and it "spired to the heavens." It was the most-noted landmark along the Oregon Trail. It was about 490 ft. when the pioneers passed it. As time passed through the early 1900s erosion made it shorter and shorter faster than ever. In the 1970s, the National Park Service agreed to make Chimney Rock a national historic site. In 1995, a visitors center and museum was built on the national historic site. There are no trails or roads leading to the rock, but in the future, there may be. In April 2006, Nebraskas state quarter was released with the rock on the back.</field>

		<field name="content">The climate of the region is semi-arid. It is a combination of desert and plains land. Chimney Rock is contained in a scenic and huge expanse called the North Platte River Valley. Inside the valley, the elevation is generally in the range of 3000-3500 feet (914-1066m). The bluffs surrounding the valley have an elevation in the range of 4000-5000 feet (1220-1524m). Summers have humid and hot temperatures, sometimes causing severe thunderstorms. Falls bring mild temperatures and comfortable conditions. Winters are usually more severe in this region of the state than in any other region. Blizzards are very common during the winter. Springs bring mild temperatures, along with a very unresting storm season.</field>

		<field name="title">Chiricahua National Monument</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Chiricahua Mountains were part of the traditional homeland of the Chiricahua Band ("band" is the proper designation for this group, not "tribe") of the Apache Indian nation.  The Chiricahuans had numerous clashes with settlers and travelers during the 19th century, many resulting (or so the Chiricahuans claimed, at least) from the "white mans" violation of previously negotiated treaties governing land use.  The Apache leaders Cochise and Geronimo were members of the Chiricahua Band who were famed, and feared, in their day.  Territory of the monument was used as a safe haven by the Chiricahuans until the cessation of hostilities; many place names in southern Arizona, including that of Cochise Stronghold, another highly scenic site in the region, date to this conflict and memorialize its more illustrious figures.  Chiricahua National Monument is one of the many U.S. national parks and monuments that came into being in the first third of the 20th century (1924), by which time the conflict with the Chiricahua Band had receded into the past.  The primary purpose was to protect the rock formations for which the monument is famed.  Much of the parks infrastructure dates to a slightly later time, as it was one of the sites of public-works projects during the Great Depression.    Swedish immigrants Neil and Emma Erickson settled in Bonita Canyon, in the lower reaches of the monument, in the 1880s, and operated the Faraway Ranch on what is now monument property.  It was originally a working ranch, but in the 20th century became a guest ranch ("dude ranch") with reasonable success well into the monuments modern history.  Structures of the Faraway Ranch are available for tours.</field>

		<field name="name">landscape</field>
		<field name="content">Chiricahuas hallmark is the enormous collection of weirdly-shaped rock pinnacles that fill the higher regions of the park, the remnants of a huge volcanic eruption about 25 million years ago.  The most accessible, and in many regards most interesting, formations are in several canyons (notably Echo Canyon) high on the side of the Chiricahua Mountains, which extend into neighboring Coronado National Forest.  The Chiricahua Mountains are an example of a "sky island," an isolated group of mountains rising without preamble or foothills from the surrounding desert.  Sky islands are prominent landforms in southern Arizona, and several of the others in the region, for example Cochise Stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains west of Chiricahua, are scenic attractions in their own right, although lacking Chiricahuas remarkable rock formations.  The park entrance is at an elevation of about 5000 feet.  The trailheads for the main formations in Echo Canyon and vicinity are at about 7000 feet, high enough that the visitor from the lowlands may notice the rarefied air; plan to be a little more winded than you expect when hiking, and allow a bit of extra time for your explorations.  The high point in the Chiricahua Mountains is above 9000 feet, but lies outside the monument.  Note: Rock climbing is generally prohibited in the monument.  The rock formations look as though they may pose interesting boulder problems, but theyre fragile (and rotten), and have been placed off limits to protect their scenic beauty.</field>

		<field name="name">flora and fauna</field>
		<field name="content">Chiricahua stands at the junction of several North American biomes, and has an interestingly diverse population of flora and fauna to match.  The characteristic medium-to-large mammals of the park are the coatimundi and javelina (peccary), both more typical of areas to the south, and white-tailed deer, black bear and the occasional mountain lion, all more commonly associated with the mountainous regions to the north.  Even the occasional jaguar strays north from Mexico, although you almost certainly wont see one.  Most of the larger animals are crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) and difficult to observe during daylight hours.  Birds are similarly diverse, and almost 200 species have been recorded at the park.  Many of them are either "erratics" that wander up from Mexico or migratory species that are only around for brief periods in spring and fall.  A spectacular example of the first class that you wont see in many places in the United States is the elegant trogon ("elegant" is part of the name of the bird, not a description); count yourself lucky if you see one.  Seeing raptors or ravens while youre out on the trails is much more common.  Rattlesnakes are common in the park, mainly although not exclusively at the lower elevations.  The rock formations produce good hiding places for snakes, so be careful where you put your hands when hiking; your main chances for dangerous rattler encounters come from poking a hand into a rock crevice where a snake is resting or sunning.  The dangerously venomous (but unusually inoffensive) coral snake is also present in the park, although youre more likely to see its non-venomous look-alike, the scarlet king snake.  Other reptiles include all manner of lizards, particularly skinks, and a single species of dry-land box turtle; youre likely to see lizards as you hike, but finding the turtle is a treat.  As for flora, the usual junction-of-biomes observations apply, with mountain (ponderosa pine) and desert (yuccas, all kinds of cactus) species coexisting in the park.  The distribution of trees and cactus varies not only according to elevation, but also with type of terrain; the fact that the canyons tend to be wetter than the more exposed terrain means that trees characteristic of the high country do better in the canyon bottoms.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">Chiricahuas climate is strongly elevation-dependent, but generally is that of a continental desert, with four distinct seasons.  However, as even the lowest parts of the monument are still well above the plain level, summer heat isnt as beastly here as in much of Arizona.  Temperatures cited below are typical of the visitor center and campground, which are at low elevations; conditions "on top" will be about 10 to 15 degrees cooler on average, with more precipitation.  Spring (March and April) is the most popular time to visit, as temperatures are generally moderate (highs around 70°F at the visitor center) and there is little precipitation.  Strong winds at this time can be annoying, particularly at the higher elevations where the temperature is a bit lower, but most of the hiking trails are sheltered and reduce exposure to the wind.  Temperatures gradually rise into June, the hottest month of the year, with average highs around 90 F and daily highs above 100 F not unknown.  Monsoonal rains usually start in July and cool things down by 10 degrees or so; July and August are the wettest months, with typically about 3 inches of rain falling in each, generally accompanied by fierce electrical storms that occur almost daily.  If youre visiting during these months, plan to start your day early and be off the highest points by early afternoon to avoid lightning hazard.  The storms taper off in September, leading to fall conditions that many view as offering the best time to visit; its unusual to get temperatures below freezing at the visitor center/campground until the end of October, and even November wont see freezing temperatures until mid-month most years.  Winter at Chiricahua is generally temperate, with highs in the 50s or low 60s and about 12 inches of snow in an average year (more in the high country).  A climatic quirk of Chiricahua is the chubasco, a violent, localized storm resulting from the decay of low-pressure systems in the Gulf of California.  Rainfall and lightning during a chubasco can be almost unbelievably intense for brief periods, and winds can reach hurricane force.  The effects are highly localized; the monument may be getting bombarded while some of the other "sky islands" 50 miles away are unaffected.  Driving to and from the monument during a chubasco can be a hairy experience, and you certainly dont want to be in the high country while one is in progress.  The effects of the chubasco might last two or three days.</field>

The Cincinnati skyline is breathtaking—especially at night—when viewed from Devou Park in northern Kentucky, Mount Echo in Price Hill, or Eden Park and neighboring Mt. Adams.  There is a rivalry between the "East Side" and "West Side" of Cincinnati. Historically people from the West Side were blue collar workers, while those from the East Side were white collar workers.</field>

		<field name="content">Cincinnatis Hyde Park neighborhood and surrounding area.   Avondale is a primarily residential urban neighborhood near the center of the city, notable for the presence of the Cincinnati Zoo. Columbia Tusculum is the oldest neighborhood in Cincinnati, founded as the settlement Columbia in 1788.  This neighborhood is known for its large collection of Queen Anne Victorian "Painted Ladies" along hillsides  that give the neighborhood somewhat of a San Francisco feel.  Go up the hill on Tusculum Ave off Columbia Parkway for the best examples.  Located in Columbia Tusculum is The Precinct which is one of the citys best dining establishments in an old Police Precinct building. Hyde Park is an upscale, largely white and upper class residential neighborhood. At the heart of the neighborhood is Hyde Park Square, a tree-lined esplanade of boutique shops, such as Morrison Me, Knickers XY, 45/46 XY Inspired, and Knickers of Hyde Park, and restaurants, including Indigo, Tellers, Cock Bull Pub and Graeters Ice Cream. Mt. Adams is a trendy, upscale neighborhood located directly northeast of downtown Cincinnati. It is known for its lively night scene, beautiful views of the skyline, and the Holy Cross-Immaculata Catholic Church. Steep terrain on three sides, and Eden Park on the fourth side, give the neighborhood a unique sense of isolation. Mt. Adams has some of the highest property values in the city, and is a good destination for anyone overly worried about personal safety. Clifton is also located near the city center, and is home to an especially wide range of people, boasting a population diverse in ethnicity, race, sexuality, gender, age, country of origin, and economic status. A number of students at the local University inhabit the stately apartment buildings, as well as many of the beautiful older homes that line the gas-lit streets, though a number of families and other residents are also proud to call Clifton home. Especially notable is the stretch of Ludlow between Clifton Ave and Whitfield, as it is home to a number of restaurants specializing both in American fare (perhaps the best Skyline Chili in all of Cincinnati, as well as local diner the Proud Rooster) and ethnic delights (Ambar and Amol India, Thai Cafe, Mediterranean Foods), as well as a number of independent shops and boutiques, and finally, one of Cincinnatis most historic and popular gay dive bars, the Golden Lions, which features dancing on Tuesday nights.  Cincinnatis incorporated neighborhoods  Northside is an economically and racially diverse neighborhood notable for a strong sense of community investment and pride. The neighborhood is home to many unique shops including Shake It Records (an independently owned record store), and two vintage clothing stores, NVision and Casablanca Vintage. Restaurants include culinary delights Take the Cake, Honey, and Melt. The nightlife in Northside is lively with a variety of clubs including Bronz, Mayday, Serpent, The Comet, and the Northside Tavern. The neighborhood is also home to a sizable LGBT population and hosts many of the citys gay pride events. This neighborhood is full of hipsters. Oakley is an up-and-coming neighborhood that borders Hyde Park. Oakley has a lively downtown area with many unique restaurants and shops including Deweys Pizza, Habits Cafe, Denim, and Bova Furniture. Also notable is Aglamesis Ice Cream, a long-time competitor of Graeters in the gourmet ice cream category. Over-the-Rhine (OTR) is the citys historic district. It is the location of Music Hall, home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Opera; Findlay Market, Ohios oldest public market in continuous operation; the Main Street Entertainment District; and much of Cincinnatis creative arts.  Also of note is the Gateway Quarter a rebranded part of the neighborhood which has some of the citys hottest/hippest bars/dining spots between Central Parkway and 14th Street on Vine. Care should be taken when visiting this neighborhood as crime is more frequent here than in other areas of the city though its going down every year, see stay safe for details. For the past thirty years the neighborhood has been a battleground between advocates for low income housing and historic preservationists/real estate developers. As a result the neighborhood is inconsistent in its make up, with high-end housing and shopping within viewing distance of abandoned and decayed buildings with boarded up windows. Price Hill is one of Cincinnati’s oldest neighborhoods, first settled in 1789 and named Price Hill in the 1870s after General Rees Price. An incline opened by Price and his sons brought many wealthy residents to the top of the hill, and the grand mansions they built still stand today. The community’s history is preserved at the Price Hill Historical Society on Warsaw Avenue, and the neighborhood is home to the first Skyline Chili parlor, the upscale Primavista Restaurant, the 120-year-old Crow’s Nest Tavern, the Gothic-style St. Lawrence Church, and the popular Blue Note Café, which features live music every night of the week. West End the little bit that survived of this once large densely populated neighborhood would not be notable for travelers except for the Dayton Street Historic District.  At its peak in the mid to late 1800s this was a millionaires row that rivaled Prairie Avenue in Chicago, or 5th Avenue in New York City in terms of wealth.  Today it’s more than a bit rundown, but less so than the neighborhood that surrounds it.  It’s worth a look for the adventurous traveler.</field>

		<field name="content">Cincinnati has four distinct seasons. Winters range from harsh to mild, while summer and early fall is hot and humid.  The average temperature in the winter drops to the low 30s (F) and during the summer reaches the upper 70s (F) to mid-90s (F).  Normally, there are very few snowy days that impair driving on the citys hilliest roads. Snow in Northern Kentucky is of exceptional concern, though, because of the increased number of hills and rural roads, which are not as quickly treated as roads in Southwest Ohio. If you plan to drive or travel through Northern Kentucky during a snowy period, be extremely careful and phone ahead to make sure your destination is still accessible.</field>

Like all of New York State west of the Genesee River, what is now called Clarence was, in 1793, purchased from the Seneca Indians and opened for settlement by the Holland Land Company, a syndicate of thirteen real estate investors from  The Netherlands . Asa Ransom was the first white resident of what is now Clarence; he opened a tavern in 1799 in the southeast corner of the town, along the Great Iroquois Trail (todays Main Street) in an area first known as Pine Grove or Ransomville and which later came to be called Clarence Hollow. He was followed a few years later by Joseph Ellicott, a Holland Land Company agent who operated a branch office near the Ransom homestead beginning in 1801. Ellicotts presence encouraged more settlers to buy land in the vicinity; in 1808, the Town of Clarence—named after Prince William, Duke of Clarence, third son of  Great Britain s King George III—was founded as one of the three original towns of Niagara County, of which Erie County was a part until 1821.   At the time of its foundation, Clarence—whose borders then also included all the land that today comprises Buffalo,  Tonawanda ,  Grand Island ,  Amherst ,  Cheektowaga ,  Lancaster ,  West Seneca ,  Lackawanna , Newstead,  Alden , and part of the towns of Elma and Marilla—had a population of perhaps 100 or 150 residents. Though Clarences land area steadily decreased over the ensuing decades as new towns were cleaved off of it, its population increased steadily, particularly beginning in the second quarter of the 19th Century as a considerable number of Germans settled on the fertile, loamy soil of Clarence. The industriousness of these Germans, part of a wave of emigration from  Germany  to North America that peaked around the 1840s, eventually made Clarence one of the most prosperous towns in the county. Aside from Clarence Hollow—then as now, the towns population center—several hamlets coalesced in Clarence during the 19th Century. These include Harris Hill, which was centered around Asa Harris homestead in the southwest corner of the town; Clarence Center, originally known as Van Tines Corners and located near the geographic center of the town, adjacent to the New York Central Railroads "Peanut Line"; a number of hamlets along Transit Road including Snearlys Corners, Swormville, Transit Station and Millersport; as well as the hamlets of Wolcottsburg and Hunts Corners in the north and northeast parts of the town, which remain rural today.    This scene is typical of the northern and eastern portions of Clarence, which are still mostly farmland.   Over the course of the 20th Century, Clarence remained predominantly farmland, with development limited almost exclusively to Main Street (a major route to Buffalo from points east in the days before the Interstate Highway System) and the aforementioned hamlets. However, a harbinger of the future for Clarence came in 1955, when construction began on the Transitown Plaza, a suburban-style shopping center located at the southeast corner of Main Street and Transit Road in the area that had once been called Snearlys Corners. Ten years later, a considerable number of residential tracts had since sprouted in Harris Hill, and the Clarence Mall (now more properly known as the "Shops at Main Transit") was under construction across Main Street from the Transitown Plaza. The Eastern Hills Mall, at that time the largest shopping center in the Buffalo area, followed in 1972.  Tragedy struck Clarence in the early morning hours of February 12, 2009 when Continental Connections Flight 3407, en route from  Newark  to Buffalo in icy conditions, stalled due to pilot error on its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. It crashed into a house in Clarence Center killing all 49 people on board and one person on the ground. The disaster inspired a rush of inquiries into the operation of regional air carriers in the United States, and spurred Congress to strengthen regulations affecting the airline industry.</field>

Essentially the only variation within the Niagara Frontier region that is major enough to be notable to visitors is that northern Erie County, including Clarence, generally sees far less lake-effect snow than the hillier terrain of southern Erie County. But, of course, this is not to say that Clarence does not still see plenty of snow in the winter.</field>

		<field name="content">Cleveland experiences four seasons, with vibrant spring blossoms, hot humid summers, colorful autumns, and frigid winters.  July, on average, is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 71.9 °F (22.2 °C); however, Cleveland summers often experience temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s °F with relatively high humidity. January, on average, is the coldest month with a mean temperature of 25.7 °F (−3.5 °C). Cleveland winters are cold, but the city usually experiences just a handful of heavy snowfalls, but does have the occasional windchill factor below 0 °F. Also, Cleveland has what is called Lake Effect snow from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, typically by early February. This is snowfall due to Clevelands position on the southern shore of Lake Erie, at the point where the shoreline shifts from an east-west direction to a northeast-southwest orientation. The city (primarily the East Side) experiences this Lake Effect snow. Clevelands Snow Belt, which receives substantially more snowfall than the West Side, begins on the East Side of the city (spreading southward from the Lake for up to 10 miles in Greater Cleveland) and stretches northeast along the I-90 corridor past  Buffalo, New York  as far as  Syracuse . Due to its proximity to Lake Erie, autumn in Cleveland has some enjoyable weather of the year. Some years, high-60-degree weather can be enjoyed through Halloween, without the humidity of the summer months.</field>

The Ice Age brought on the formation of Clifty Falls, when south flowing waters of Clifty Creek met the Ohio River, plunging two hundred feet high. Eventually the falls cut their way more then two miles into the bedrock. Now its sixty feet high, slowly making its way upstream at around one-quarter inch a year.   Many of the stone work and pathways got their start from the Madison and Indianapolis railroad being built in the area around 1852. The railroad went bankrupt, leaving excellent foot trails and a muddy rock strewn 600-foot tunnel accessible by the trails.</field>

		<field name="content">Composer Igor Stravinsky once rode a ski lift in Aspen in the summertime, while Prospector Alferd Packer dined on human flesh near  Lake City . Inventor Nikola Tesla created artificial lightning hundreds of feet long in Colorado Springs, and Writer Oscar Wilde attended a fancy dinner party at the bottom of a  Leadville  silver mine. Outlaw Butch Cassidy robbed the bank in  Telluride , while Lawman Doc Holliday and Showman Buffalo Bill were buried in  Glenwood Springs  and Denver, respectively. All are part of the quirky and sometimes colorful history of Colorado.  Around 15,000 years ago, Native Americans migrated to Colorado, a nomadic group of hunter-gatherers distributed on the plains as well as the western plateaus. The first agricultural communities appeared on the  Eastern Plains  approximately 5,000 years ago. Circa 600 AD, the Ancient Pueblo Peoples began building elaborate communities in  Southwestern Colorado  in the  Mesa Verde  area. Other Native American groups, including the Arapaho, Apache, Cheyenne, Comanche,  Kiowa, Shoshone and Utes have called Colorado home.  The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. In 1541, Coronado led an expedition north through Colorado from Mexico in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola, where the streets were supposed to be paved with gold.   A midsummer Columbine (the state flower) on Arapahoe Pass Trail near  Boulder  In 1803, Emperor Napoleon Buonaparte sold the United States a vast tract of land known as the "Louisiana Purchase," an area which included Colorado. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike explored the recently purchased territory at President Thomas Jeffersons behest.  Pike and his men "discovered" the 14,000 ft (4, 268 m) peak near Colorado Springs, which today bears his name.   From the 1820s through the 1840s, fur trappers and mountain men began harvesting highly-valued beaver and buffalo pelts for the Eastern U.S. and Europe. Trading posts were established for barter with the Native Americans, while trade routes sprang up between the United States and  Mexico .  In 1858, gold was discovered at the mouth of Dry Creek in the present-day Denver suburb of  Englewood , triggering the "Pikes Peak or Bust" gold rush of 1858-59. Approximately 50,000 people immigrated to Colorado in search of gold, creating the first large scale permanent settlements. Hard rock silver and gold mining towns were established throughout the territory.   A new town named Denver City was founded in honor of James W. Denver, governor of Kansas Territory.   In 1876, Colorado was admitted as the thirty-eighth state in the union. Colorado was called the "Centennial State" in honor of the one-hundredth anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.  In 1912,  Hot Sulphur Springs  hosted a ski jumping tournament and invited the Denver press. From this humble beginning, Colorados ski industry was born. A handful of early ski runs were built around the state over the next 20 years, with the Highland-Bavarian Corporation beginning a rudimentary development of Aspen. World War II and the arrival of the 10th Mountain Division to train near  Minturn  ushered in the mid-20th century explosion of Colorado ski resorts. Trained for high alpine combat in Italy, the alumni of the 10th Mountain Division returned to the U.S. after the war to build Aspen, Vail and  Arapahoe Basin .   By the 1960s, Colorado was a popular global destination for  alpine skiing , with travelers drawn to the states sunny days and champagne snow.</field>

		<field name="content">View from Telluride ski slopes.  Colorado is split down the middle north to south by the Rocky Mountains.  To the east is a region of high prairie, dry and wide open.  To the west are rugged mountains arranged in various groups or ranges.  (Interestingly, the largest single range in the state, the San Juan Mountains of the southwestern quarter, arent technically part of the Rockies.)  Meandering through the mountains is an imaginary line called the Continental Divide.  This marks the flow of precipitation.  Rain falling on the west of the Divide makes its way to the Pacific Ocean.  Rain on the east makes its way to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.  What may be surprising to visitors, however, is that, despite stereotypes, comparatively little of the state is actually mountainous.  Perhaps a third of it is covered by hills or mountains, and even less is actually home to the soaring, jagged peaks for which the state is known.  Colorado has 54 mountain peaks above 14,000 ft (4,267 m) of elevation. The highest peak, Mount Elbert, rises to 14,440 ft (4,401 m) above sea level making it the highest peak in the North American Rockies. Tourism is a major industry, with skiing/snowboarding, hiking/camping, hunting, mountaineering and fishing as large sources of income for the state economy.  Colorados population was 4,301,261 in the 2000 census, and the states population is growing, particularly in the large towns along the Front Range where the prairie and mountains meet. These towns include the capital, Denver, and Colorado Springs, Boulder,  Longmont , Loveland and Fort Collins.  Many of the residents of Colorado migrated from other states so being a "Colorado Native" is a point of pride with many people.</field>

		<field name="content">Those whove never been to Colorado might imagine a frigid, snowy states. However, Denvers 300 sunny days a year and overall mild temperatures are a point of pride among Coloradoans. Due to the Rocky Mountains which split the state in half, climate differs greatly from east to west, low to high. The weather changes rapidly and unpredictably, so be prepared for anything if youre traveling in most seasons. Colorado is also an exceptionally dry state, and has suffered through several recent droughts. Drink lots of waters and watch for dehydration.  Winter is generally cold, though the weather is drastically different depending on elevation. While the mountains are likely to experience frequent snow storms - guaranteeing lots of fresh powder for skiing - these become less and less frequent as one travels down on the Eastern slopes. Lower elevations to the east of the Rockies experience occasional snow storms and even huge blizzards, but low temperatures seldom last long, and the winter is frequently interrupted by warm days with temperatures in the 50s, 60s, or even higher. Bring warm snow clothes, but also a light jacket. While March is the snowiest month of the year, the warm days of spring are more frequent in this month, and even in the mountains it is not unusual for temperatures to rise to the 60s or above, making for some very interesting skiing.  Spring is generally brief and mild. Snow is not uncommon as late as May, even in lower elevation cities, and some ski resorts stay open as late as July. However, except during snow, the temperatures are warm and pleasant. Be prepared for rapid changes - its not unusual for there to be 80 degree temperatures during the day and snow in the evening.  Summer is perhaps Colorados most predictable season. While some ski resorts may stay open until July, dont be deceived: the temperatures are warm, even in the mountains. While days in the 80s and 90s are frequent, higher temperatures are not unheard of. Fortunately, Colorados low humidity means that even the hottest days dont pack the punch of heat in more humid regions. Summer does arrive later in the mountains, and some peaks have snow all year round. Still, even at the higher elevation, summer days tend to be warm, though nights are cooler. Afternoon thunderstorms are frequent starting in mid-July and continuing until about mid-September. Though very heavy, these are usually brief, lasting from as short as half an hour to two or three hours. Though they are a great relief from the dry days of earlier summer, lighting is dangerous and a huge risk factor for forest fires. These afternoon thunderstorms are especially severe in the eastern plain region of Colorado, and tornadoes also occur during this time. South Eastern Colorado has very desert-like summers, including flora and fauna, and shares many similarities to nearby New Mexico.  Fall is another relatively short season in Colorado. While daytime temperatures tend to stay warm, nighttime temperatures begin to drop starting in late August. Aspens, the primary native deciduous tree, changes colors in mid September. The first snow usually arrives sometime in October at lower elevations, though even earlier snows are not unheard of, and fairly common in the mountains.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Early Past Prehistoric foragers hunted the area and fished its waters. The Congaree Indians claimed the floodplain and Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto recounted the intrigue of the area in his journals. Around 1700, the Congarees were decimated by a smallpox epidemic introduced with the arrival of European settlers. The new residents obtained land grants from the King of England until 1776 when the state of South Carolina assumed the right to distribute ownership of the land. Attempts to make the land suitable for planting, as well as grazing, continued through 1860. The floodplains minor changes in elevation and consequent flooding stifled agricultural activity; but the intermittent flooding allowed for soil nutrient renewal and enabled the areas trees to thrive. Bald Cypress, in particular, became a target for logging. By 1905, the Santee River Cypress Lumber Company, owned by Francis Beidler, had acquired much of the land. Poor accessibility by land confined logging to tracts near waterways so that logs could be floated down river. In the perpetual dampness, though, many of the cut trees remained too green to float. Operations were suspended within ten years, leaving the floodplain basically untouched.  Recent Events In 1969 relatively high timber prices prompted private landowners to consider resuming logging operations. As a result of an effective "grass roots" campaign launched by the Sierra Club and many local individuals, Congress established Congaree Swamp National Monument in 1976. That designation was not enough to protect the area from the force of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The park lost several National Champion trees, but the overall effect was a natural stimulus to growth. Hugo snapped tree tops, thereby allowing sunlight to come through the canopy, promoting new growth beneath. Fallen trees have provided shelter for many species of organisms; standing dead trees became new homes for a variety of plant and animal species, including fungi, insects, reptiles, birds, and bats.  On June 30, 1983 Congaree Swamp National Monument was designated an International Biosphere Reserve. In July of 2001 it was designated a Globally Important Bird Area, and on November 10, 2003 it was designated as the nations 57th National Park..</field>

		<field name="content">A mix of pine forest and floodplain, the landscape here is the main reason to visit. The water level rises based on the level of the nearby Congaree river, and early months in spring and fall can find parts of the handicapped-accessible boardwalk flooded over. The subtropical flood plain was never harvested for timber, and so much of it is thick with dense, undergrowth that, to the unfamiliar, can seem thick as a jungle. The tree canopy is high here, and in most places, dense. Deep in the forest, the temperature drops noticeably when only small patches of sunlight reach the ground. Small creeks run throughout the park, and several small lakes dot the landscape. At worst, its mosquito-ridden and muddy. At best, the cypress knees and drippy Spanish moss look like a set out of Lord of the Rings. Most days, the park manages to accomplish both at once.</field>

		<field name="content">Flora - Pines dominate in the higher areas, but on the floodplain proper, cypress and tupelo dominate. Because the forest was never timbered, the several of the tallest cypress trees in the world can be found within the park - ask rangers for help locating them. Other species of tree include sassafras, holly, sweetgum, and oak.    Fauna - Birders love Congaree National Park. Pileated woodpeckers abound, even on the boardwalk near the visitors center. Other small songbirds are easy to find. Hawks are uncommon, but sometimes spotted, and farther into the park, wild turkeys have been seen. If youre lucky, you may see an osprey or two by the river. Squirrels abound, and larger mammals, such as white-tailed deer and coyotes may be heard, if not seen. All the wildlife here isnt the cuddly variety. Snakes are endemic to the area, and poisonous variety include the rare coralsnake, the copperhead, the canebrake rattler, and the ubiquitous cottonmouth. Use caution in areas that snakes may frequent, such as warm rocks, holes, and downed trees. The Congaree Swamp is also one of the most northern parts of the river with alligators, and wild pigs roam the area. These arent fuzzy little porkers, however - theyre frequently hunted in other parts of South Carolina and are known to be rather protective mothers. If you hear snuffling and cloven hooves on the forest floor, be careful.Fishing may or may not be allowed in parts of the park, depending on the sign you consult. Check at the visitors center before toting your pole into the backcountry. The lakes have lots of turtles - including snappers - and with a pair of polarized glasses, youll likely see long-nosed gar, bass, perch, and a variety of sunfish.</field>

The weather in Connecticut is generally stable compared to many other parts of the country. Dangers that plague many regions of the country (e.g., tornadoes, mudslides, earthquakes, etc.,) are not a danger here.   It is recommended to bring clothes for a variety of temperatures when visiting, and to check the weather report closely. Although there are periods of little or no rain, a raincoat or umbrella are good items to pack. Warm clothes in the winter and light clothes in the summer are also important, although it is recommended to pack a light jacket, even in the summer months.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Crater Lake was formed from the collapse of Mount Mazama, a volcano in southern Oregon that once stood about 11,000 feet tall.  A series of destructive eruptions around 5000 BC caused the mountains peak to collapse into its lava chamber, resulting in a caldera nearly six miles wide.  Over time, snowmelt and rain collected in the crater to form the lake, which at 1,949 feet deep, is presently the deepest in the USA, 2nd in North America, and 9th in the world.  Based on a comparison of average depths, however, Crater Lake at 1148 feet, is the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and third deepest in the world.  The first known white man to reach the lake was prospector John Hillman, who found the lake in 1853.  Largely through the efforts of naturalist William Gladstone Steel, the United States declared Crater Lake a national park in 1902.</field>

The lake is often enveloped in heavy snow during the fall, winter, and spring, forcing the closure of roads and trails.  In fact, the lake averages 533 inches of snow a year.  Consequently, the best time to visit Crater Lake is in the summer months, when all facilities, roads, and trails are open.</field>

		<field name="content">Over the past 15,000 years, lava eruptions created a rugged but scenic landscape that has forced animals and plants to adapt, and people to endure, detour, or ponder. Located on the Snake River Plain, a volcanic terrain spanning southern Idaho, the Monument and Preserve encompasses the Great Rift volcanic rift zone. In places, this plain is 60 miles wide, with basalt lava deposits over 10,000 feet deep in some locations. Eruptions 2,000 years ago at the Craters of the Moon and the Wapi lava fields are among the most recent volcanic activity to take place anywhere in this immense geographic area.  Features visible today include an isolated landscape filled with such features as cinder cones, spatter cones, lava tubes, and several types of lava flows.</field>

		<field name="content">Flora and lava  Despite the seemingly barren landscape the park supports a rich diversity of life including more than 660 types of plants and over 280 animal species.  While searing lava flows that initially destroyed everything in their path today protect the last refuges of intact sagebrush steppe communities on the Snake River Plain. These islands of vegetation, known as kipukas, provide important examples of what is "natural".   Animals seen most frequently in the park are birds and some rodents. The changing weather and seasons play a large role in determining which animals are active at any given time.  Most desert animals are nocturnal, or mainly active at night, and include woodrats (also called packrats), skunks, foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, bats, nighthawks, owls, and most other small desert rodents.  Animals that are most active at dawn and dusk, when temperatures are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough to allow them to locate food. Crepuscular animals in the park include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.  The parks diurnal animals are those that are most active during the day, and include ground squirrels, marmots, chipmunks, lizards, snakes, hawks, and eagles.  Animals that are unique to Craters of the Moon and the surrounding area include subspecies of Great Basin pocket mouse, pika, yellow pine chipmunk, and yellow-bellied marmot are found nowhere else in the world. Lava tube beetles and many other cave animals are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho.  To date there have been over 212 species of birds sighted on or over the monument and preserve. Many of these are rocky area or shrubland specialists seen in large numbers in only a few other places in the country.  Most are found in the areas of the park where water occurs; many small ponds and lakes formed by spring rains and snow melt provide temporary homes for a surprising number of waterbirds, such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, herons, and gulls. Even swans are sighted regularly during the spring migration north to Canada. A few small riparian areas and aspen clumps provide shelter for warblers, vireos, catbirds, orioles, woodpeckers, and more. Small marshes on the northern edge of the lava flow attract blackbirds, wrens, and herons.  The parks shrublands supports birds such as Brewers Sparrows, Sage Sparrows, Sage Thrasher, and Sage Grouse.  Limber pine, rocky mountain, and Utah juniper stands growing in cinder gardens and kipuka areas offer habitat to woodpeckers, flycatchers, chickadees, nuthatches, warblers, sparrows, and finches. These patches of trees in the midst of a vast sea of shrublands and barren lava flows are a beacon to many migrating birds, such as warblers, sparrows, and flycatchers, which reside here for brief periods in the spring and fall.  The seemingly barren lava flows provide shelter for Mountain Bluebirds, Violet-green Swallows, and Rock Wrens. During the long, cold winters that are characterized by blowing snow and temperatures well below freezing, birds are still found at Craters of the Moon. Ravens, nutcrackers, and chickadees live here all year. Mountain and arctic birds that stay for the winter include Black and Gray Crowned Rosy-finches, Rough-legged Hawks, Northern Shrikes, Snow Buntings, and in some years even Snowy Owls or Gyrfalcons.</field>

		<field name="content">Extremes of weather and climate prevail at Craters of the Moon across seasons and elevations. From the foothills of the Pioneer Mountains on the northern end of the monument to the Snake River on the south, weather conditions vary significantly. As elevation decreases from north to south, temperatures increase and precipitation decreases. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 inches at the monument Visitor Center to just under 10 inches near the Snake River at Minidoka Dam. In February, average snow depth ranges from 26 inches at the north end of the monument to just 2 inches at the south end. Intense summer sun bakes the black lava, generating surface temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air temperatures in the 90s. Drying winds are a daily occurrence, especially in the afternoon, and may reach 15 to 30 miles per hour. In June, July, and August, the average monthly precipitation is less than two inches. Winter transforms Craters of the Moon into a dramatic landscape of rugged black lava and soft white snow. Fall and spring are milder, with unsettled weather. Despite harsh conditions, delicate wildflowers burst to life in May or June against the more monochromatic background of the cinder slopes: pink monkeyflowers, yellow dwarf buckwheats, white bitterroots, and many others. No matter what the season or the weather, the wide open desert sky at Craters of the Moon offers unobstructed views of spectacular cloud formations, sunrises, sunsets, moonscapes, and stars.</field>

In winter and summer it can also be a very dry place, as it receives warmer, drier weather from the Mojave Desert in the west and the Great Plains in the north.  Winters are generally mild, with average highs in the 50s and 60s (10-20C) and average lows around the freezing mark. It does snow in Dallas a couple times a year, and there is the rare day where temperatures will not get out of the 30s (0-5C), but for the most part winter is just relatively dry and cool. There is, however, the danger of freezing rain and ice storms.  Spring and fall bring very pleasant temperatures, but spring is also known for its storms. With Dallas lying within Tornado Alley, springtime weather can be quite volatile and severe storms often occur. Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures often surpassing 100F (38C).  Average rainfall in Dallas is 37.1 inches (942.3nbsp;mm) per year, and average snowfall is about 2.5 inches (63.5nbsp;mm) per year.</field>

		<field name="content">Darien Lake didnt exist before 1955.  It was that year that the 25-acre man-made lake opened to the public (admission $0.50 for adults, $0.25 for children 10 and older).  Swimming and picnicking were the only attractions.  It was popular at first, but after a few years, records of it as a summer destination disappear.  By 1964, Darien Lake was open again, this time with boating, camping, and picnicking facilities.  The first rides were added in the 1970s, and by 1980 the area had grown into a full-fledged amusement park, named Darien Lake Fun Country.  The park added a marquee attraction in 1982: the Viper, the first roller coaster in the world with five inversions.  In 1983, the park was sold; "Fun Country" was dropped from the name (although the park is still known by some locals as "Fun Country"), and the new owners acquired the Giant Wheel, a 165-foot (50m) Ferris wheel, from the 1982 Worlds Fair in  Knoxville .  The park continued to grow and add attractions, although it wouldnt get its second roller coastermdash;the wooden Predatormdash;until 1990.  The same year, a small water park was added in the middle of the park.  1993 saw the opening of the 21,600-capacity amphitheater, which replaced a smaller amphitheater and started attracting major touring acts.  In the late nineties, the owners added a new roller coaster each year, increasing the parks total to five and making the park the roller coaster capital of the state.  In 1999, the park was rebranded as Six Flags Darien Lake to reflect its ownership by the mega-chain, and several licensed Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters made appearances in the park.  The parent company soon fell into financial trouble due to overextension, however; Darien Lake was among seven properties put up for sale in 2006, and in 2007 the park was bought and "Six Flags" dropped from the name.  Although the new owners added another coaster in 2008, the Orange County Choppers MotoCoaster, the park endured a couple of lean years as it struggled to reestablish itself.  By the end of 2010, however, it was clear that the park was thriving again, as the year saw the expansion of the water park areas into a new "separate" park called SplashTown, new ticket packages, and a new paint job for the venerable Viper.</field>

Winters have cold temperatures and often high winds.  Snow is likely to fall from November through February, however it has been know to snow as late as April. Average snowfall in Davenport is 30.7 inches (78nbsp;cm) per year. January is on average the coldest month, while July is the warmest. The highest temperature recorded in Davenport was 103 °F (39 °C) on July 18, 2006. The lowest temperature, −22 °F (−30 °C), was recorded on February 2 and February 3, 1996. Spring and Autumn can be difficult seasons to dress for as the days can be quite warm while the evenings can be quite cool.    Flooding can occur along the Mississippi River due to the lack of a flood wall. During the Great Flood of 1993, the river crested at 22.63 feet (6.90 m) on July 9, nearly 8 feet (2.4 m) above flood stage.  Flooding, however, only affects the river front parks and River Drive in the downtown area.  Most of the city is above the bluffs that overlook the river and most of the city below the bluffs is not directly affected.</field>

Storms during this period may produce tornadoes. ;Summer : characteristically hot and humid.  While the thermometer may read one number in the summer, it will often feel hotter due to humidity. ;Autumn : Autumn in Dayton and Southwest Ohio is usually cool, but an extension of summer-like days into this season is possible. Storms seem to increase during this season too, which, due to the fluctuation of temperatures can produce extremely dangerous storms with the potential of producing tornadoes late into the year.</field>

The separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach and Seabreeze merged to form Daytona Beach in 1926. In the 1920s, the city became known as The Worlds Most Famous Beach.  Daytonas wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts beginning in 1902, when pioneers in the industry tested their inventions.  On 8 March 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Course. In 1959, William France created Daytona International Speedway to replace the beach course.    Automobiles are still permitted on the beach mdash; at much slower speeds! Daytona is one of the few places in the world where a family car can be driven on an ocean beach.</field>

It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona, and Port Orange.     Daytona Beach has a very humid subtropical climate typical for a city in the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and humid with highs usually in the 90s (32+°C)and a heat index often exceeding 100°F (38°C). Thunderstorms are frequent in summer afternoons and the hot, humid weather can last through the fall months. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold fronts followed by warmer air. In wintertime, temperatures dip into the low 40s and upper 30s (5°C) on occasion, although freezes are rare.  Frost occurs a few times a year mainly in the inland areas. Snowfall is extremely rare: the last time snow flurries fell on Daytona Beach was in January 2003. Temperatures in spring are famously pleasant with warm afternoons, cool evenings, and far less humidity. This beautiful weather usually attracts tourists back to the beaches by early March.</field>

		<field name="content">The first non-Native Americans arrived in Death Valley in 1849 looking for a shortcut to the California gold fields. Although only one member of their party died, the name Death Valley was given to the area. Various mining operations used the valley afterwards, most notably for borax mining. When mining prospects went sour, the Pacific Coast Borax Company lobbied for federal protection of Death Valley, in order to develop tourism. President Hoover declared about two million acres of the area a national monument in 1933. In 1994 the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres and declared a national park.</field>

		<field name="content">Badwater Basin, lowest point in North America   Death Valley National Park is the lowest point in North America and one of the hottest places in the world. It is also a vast geological museum, containing examples of most of the earths geological eras. Death Valley National Park includes all of Death Valley, a 130-mile-long north/south-trending trough that formed between two major block-faulted mountain ranges: the Amargosa Range on the east and the Panamint Range on the west. Telescope Peak, the highest peak in the Park and in the Panamint Mountains, rises 11,049 feet above sea level and lies only 15 miles from the lowest point in the United States in the Badwater Basin salt pan, 282 feet below sea level. The California Desert Protection Act added most of the Saline, Eureka, northern Panamint, and Greenwater valleys to the Park.</field>

		<field name="content">Animal life is varied, and numerous species of reptiles, birds and  mammals populate Death Valley, adapting well to the desert environment. However, many of these animals have a nocturnal lifestyle in order to escape the searing climate and can be difficult to spot.  The largest native mammal in the area, and perhaps the best studied member of the fauna, is the desert bighorn sheep. Small herds of sheep are most commonly found in the mountains surrounding Death Valley but at least occasionally visit the valley floor. Look for these animals near the springs and seeps that can be found throughout the park.  Over 350 species of birds are now known to inhabit or visit the area. And even native fish are to be found in Death Valley - several forms of desert pupfish of the genus Cyprinodon live in Salt Creek and other permanent bodies of water.</field>

		<field name="content">Death Valley is one of the hottest places in the world. Air temperatures over 120 °F (49 °C) are common during the summer months of June, July, August and September. The hottest recorded temperature in the world was measured in the park in 1913 at a blazing 134 °F (57 °C) (a measurement of 136 °F recorded in  Libya  in 1922 has since been dismissed due to questions over its accuracy). Since it is often up to four degrees hotter near Badwater than it is near Furnace Creek where the official record was recorded, it is entirely likely that Death Valley should hold the title as the hottest place on Earth.  Fortunately, temperatures from November through March are mild with highs averaging in the 60s and 70s (15-25) with winter nighttime lows usually in the 40s (5-10). This makes the winter and early spring the best seasons to visit.   Sun-baked sand in Death Valley   Very little rain falls in the valley, but rainfall in the mountains often sends floodwaters roaring down narrow canyons, scouring boulders, rocks and soil along the way and eventually depositing them in the valley. These deposits are evident in the form of gigantic Alluvial fans seen throughout the valley. Many of these fans reach over a mile wide and are the product of hundreds and thousands of years of this process.  The granular structure of these fans is also interesting to note as you will commonly see the larger boulders near the top of these structures and as you go further and further down, the granularity becomes finer and finer until you are finally left with the salts on the valley floor!  The higher elevations of the Panamint Range reach up to 11,049 feet (3,368 m) at Telescope Peak and are usually covered with snow from November to May, making a breathtaking backdrop to this unique desert climate.  A land of extremes and superlatives, there are locations within the park that allow the visitor to see both the lowest and highest elevations in the 48 contiguous United States on a clear day. As far as US phenomena occur, not only does it feature the hottest recorded temperature, but also reports the lowest annual precipitation, the tallest sand dunes, and at 13,628 square kilometers, is the largest National Park in the 48 contiguous United States.</field>

		<field name="content">Deerfield Beach has a true tropical climate, with hot, humid summers, and warm, dry winters. The city does experience cold fronts from November through March. However, the average monthly temperature for any month has never been recorded as being under 64.4 °F (January averages 66 °F). Most of the year is warm and humid, and the summers are almost identical to the climate of the Caribbean tropics. In addition, the city gets most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is relatively dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when it gives way to the dry season. The dry season features mild temperatures with some invasions of colder air, which is when the little winter rainfall occurs — with the passing of a front.   The hurricane season largely coincides with the wet season. 69% of the citys annual rainfall occurs during the five month summer period. The hurricane season is between 1 June and 30 November, with major hurricanes most likely to affect Florida in September and October. The most recent storms to directly affect the city were Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both of which struck the city in 2005; other direct hits were Hurricane Cleo in 1964, Hurricane King in 1950 and the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane.</field>

Later, DeLand entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer from Philadelphia and a founding trustee. In 1889, it was renamed John B. Stetson University after its new patron. The name was later shortened to Stetson University, and in 1900 it became the first law school in Florida. The Universitys sports teams are called the Mad Hatters.   DeLand grew during the 1920s Florida Land Boom.

Summers are almost always hot, very humid, and unpleasant. The air quality is accordingly poor, but no more so than surrounding counties. Winters, although it rarely snows heavily, can get bitterly cold. Spring and fall are generally the nicest seasons, although snow storms can arrive in April, and heat waves can hit in late November.  Delaware weather is unpredictable, the only real way to prepare would be to carry an umbrella and pray for sunshine. Average monthly temperatures range from a high of 85.6 degrees to a low of 23.2 degrees.</field>

		<field name="content">The climate in Delray Beach is tropical, with some discernible seasons, although not in the temperate climate sense. Delray Beach does experience cold fronts from November through March, however most of the year is warm and humid and the mean temperature for any month is never below 64.4°F (18°C). The brief, mild "winters" (December to early March) are noticeably cooler than the more humid summers. High temperatures during "winter" typically range from 65°F to 82°F (18°C to 28°C), although during cold spells high temperatures can remain in the 50s°F (10°C to 15°C).   The six months of summer (May through October) are hot and humid although easterly winds off the Atlantic and afternoon thunderstorms from the interior tend to temper the heat on a day to day basis during this period. Daily high temperatures consistently range between 86°F to 92°F (30°C to 33°C) between early June and late September. The heat index or humidex consistently measures between 90°F to 102°F (32°C to 38°C) during this period. Low temperatures average between 72°F to 81°F (22°C to 27°C) during this period.  The transitional months, November, March and April, are typically dry and warm with temperatures ranging from 55°F to 85°F (12°C to 28°C), although there can be short periods of quite cool weather in March and late November. Hurricane season is officially from June 1 through November 30, with the peak months being August, September and October. The city has received direct or near direct hits from hurricanes in 1928, 1947, 1949, 1964, 1965, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2004, and 2005.</field>

		<field name="content">Denver residents enjoy a mild climate and the most sunshine of any US state, with four pronounced seasons.  Heavy snowfalls can occur between October and March, often alternating with days of high temperatures and sunshine. About once a year, a snowfall of over a few feet occurs.  Winter is also when the Denver area gets pounded by a phenomenon known as the "Chinook". Thats when air flows over the mountains to the west and sinks on the leeward (eastern) slopes of the foothills and warms up. This raises air temperatures dramatically, which can last for several days.  If youre planning to visit Denver during the winter, be prepared with full winter gear just in case, but also pack a light sweater and t-shirt; the weather is usually very sunny and mild.   Evening thunderstorms are common in late spring and fall   Spring in Denver is pleasant, though generally rather brief.  Trees begin budding by late March and are in full leaf by mid April to mid May.  March, on average, is Denvers snowiest month.  By June, Denver enters its summer season.  Temperatures typically rise in earnest at this time, with most heat waves beginning in mid-June and continuing through July, usually Denvers hottest month with temperatures in the high 80s to mid-90s.  By late July, the southwest monsoon kicks in. In August, short spells of thunderstorms occur about three to four days per week. By late August, temperatures begin to drop with a noticeable difference between day time and night time temperatures. As the days get shorter through September and October, daytime temperatures drop to the high 50s to mid-60s. Slather on that sunscreen all summer long; the rays are strong and the air is dry, with temperatures often reaching the upper 90s in July and August.  Autumn is a peaceful time to visit, with mild temperatures, little severe weather and lots of that famous clear blue sky. Youll get to see the trees display their fall colors, which usually peak around mid-September in the mountains and October in the city itself. October usually brings the first snowfall of the season to Denver, although its very light. By November, its clear that winter is on its way, with plenty of clouds, some snow and much cooler temperatures.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Tower was known as "Mateo Tipi" by American Indians of the region, and is considered sacred. "Mateo Tipi" translates as "Bear Lodge", as the Indian legend revolves around the creation of the tower as a refuge for a group of Indian youths being pursued by a giant bear. Imploring the great spirit to save them, a rock they were standing on began to rise into the air. The bear tried to reach them, with its claws carving the fluted columns into the rock. The youths then were taken up and became what is known as the seven sisters constellation. A U.S. cavalry scouting party reached the tower in 1876 and incorrectly translated the name to mean "Bad Gods Tower" and thus its present name remains.  Devils Tower is probably best known as the location of the alien-human rendezvous point in Steven Spielbergs oscar winning 1977 Science Fiction film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Production designer Joe Alves traveled the west looking for a proper landmark and stumbled across the obscure park finding it a perfect fit for use in the film. Devils Tower National Monument is administered by the National Park Service, a part of the Department of Interior, and is a popular place for rock climbing, hiking, and as a tourist waypoint located between popular destinations such as  Mount Rushmore National Memorial ,  Badlands National Park ,  Yellowstone National Park  and  Grand Teton National Park .</field>

		<field name="content">The one obvious contrast in landscape here is jarringly weird, and indeed the main attraction! Devils Tower is one of the worlds most striking natural monoliths in no small part for its sheer, vertical form, and its dramatic contrast with the rolling prairie extending in all directions for seemingly endless distances (the rolling prairie being essentially a lower extension of the nearby  Black Hills  in  South Dakota ).  The tower itself is the eroded remnant of a giant laccolith—an igneous intrusion produced by rising molten magma exploiting a weak point in the existing sedimentary rock layers about 65 million years ago. Over the epochs since, the softer sandstones and shales that covered and surrounded the intrusion (which had pushed them up), leaving us with this alien-attracting, arrestive tower. The tower is fully surrounded by constantly eroding hexagular basalt columns (in fact, the same columnar basalt found at the  Giants Causeway  in  Northern Ireland , as well as at  Devils Postpile National Monument  in  California ).   A close up of the hexagonal basalt columns surrounding the tower   You might notice that the forest rolling along the hills is a little repetitive. The lack of diversity was caused by fire suppression by ranchers, settlers, and actually the U.S. Forest and Park Services, as a means of avoiding fires spreading to settled areas and the burning down of the valuable and beautiful forests. But without the natural cycle renewal caused by (natural) forest fires, the Ponderosa pine has taken over, depriving any smaller ground plants from getting needed sunlight. In more recent decades, the Park Service has undertaken prescribed burns to try and restore the rich, diverse ecosystem that once prevailed.</field>

		<field name="content">Dinosaur National Monuments cultural history dates back 10,000 years.  The Yampa and Green Rivers have provided water for survival in an arid country.  Indian rock art in the form of petroglyphs and pictographs provide evidence that many people have come before us.  The Fremont Indians lived in the canyons in Dinosaur National Monument 800 - 1,200 years ago.  Following the Fremont were the Ute and Shoshone, who are still found in the area today.  Early settlers left their mark on the landscape with their homesteads.  Those who had access to the rivers and a constant flow of water survived, while others dried up with drought and moved away.  Now, many of the remains of homesteads are found alongside the Indian art work of the past.  The parks value as a site for dinosaur remains was established when paleontologist Earl Douglass first came to Utah looking for mammal fossils. He returned in 1909 and discovered an immense deposit of dinosaur bones, now protected at Dinosaur National Monument. Although made famous by dinosaurs, Douglass died preferring his beloved mammal fossils over dinosaurs.</field>

		<field name="content">Due to the close proximity of Lake Superior, a deep lake and the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area, Duluth can be cool or cold anytime of year. The official temperatures are reported from the airport, over the hill, and can be ten or more degrees (Fahrenheit) above the downtown temperatures. Sixties (18C +/-) for a high in August are not uncommon, but it can reach the 80s (about 28C) just as easily. Bitter windchills can occur in the winter, although air temperatures generally do not go below -20F (-29C). Despite this, some people bike to work year-round.</field>

Summertime highs average in the low 80s, but with occasional short heat waves with temps over 95F, with considerable humidity and occasionally intense thunderstorms.   Winters are somewhat cold with average highs in the mid to upper 30s, but with occasional short thaws when temperatures can suddenly rise over 65F for a few days. Severe cold snaps are common, with highs dropping into the twenties. Heavy snowfalls rarely occur more than once or twice each winter, but a wintry mix of ice, sleet, and light snow is possible from mid-November through early April. The combination of above freezing daytime temps and below freezing nights makes black ice a constant wintertime driving hazard even when there has not been precipitation recently.  Late spring and early summer (from mid-April to late June), and autumn are the most pleasant times of the year, with very mild temperatures and generally low humidity. Autumn leaf season usually arrives in the last two weeks of October.</field>

Sandstone bluffs and mesas border the eastern side, providing access to vast wilderness.  Elevation in the park ranges from 6500 to 8300 ft.  The most recent lava flow emanated from McCartys Crater within the last 2,000 to 3,000 years, so the park remains a geologically active area.</field>

The highest ground is populated by Dade County Slash Pine forest, with underbrush that includes saw palmetto. Both plants encourage fire which keeps the hardwoods out. A little lower "altitude" brings cypress heads, and lower than that swampland (a river of grass). In the swampland, small hills (a couple of inches higher than water level) are covered with tropical hardwoods with dense foliage below. As you get to the south and southwest part of the glades, the tides bring in salt loving plants like mangroves and their kin. There is a lot to see but it takes paying attention to it—and it is well worth the time. Things that may seem small at first may be really big and bring fond memories.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In the mid 17th century Fire Island was used as a base for whaling. Whalers would watch for spouting whales from towers, then launch their boats after them. The island also has a bit of pirate history as pirates were known to build fires on the island to attract passing boats on which to prey.  The Fire Island Lighthouse was first built in 1826 at a height of 74 feet due to the large number of shipwrecks. In 1868, a new lighthouse was built to a height of 168 feet, 100 feet from the old. The foundation of the original lighthouse can still be seen today. For many immigrants the lighthouse was their first sight of land when arriving to America. In less than a century four miles of sand accumulated between the lighthouse and the western tip of the island. The island still grows at its western end and is constantly reshaped.  The state set aside part of Fire Island as a state park in 1908, making it the first state park on Long Island. In the 1920s Fire Island began its life as a Bohemian beach community. By the 1950s real estate was booming as the island became a fashionable retreat from the city. In 1964 the rest of the lands were designated the Fire Island National Seashore. In 1980 Congress set aside 1400 acres as the Otis Pike Wilderness area.</field>

		<field name="content">All barrier islands are shaped to some degree by the ocean, and that certainly applies to Fire Island. The Sunken Forest area is the result of high dunes built up on both sides of the trees which protect them and allow their protected growth. Swamp species such as red maple and sour gum are then able to thrive there. On the west end of the island new land has formed at the rate of 50 meters a year. In some areas dunes are whipped into low cliffs in one season and the cliffs later dissolved to sloping beach.</field>

		<field name="content">From the unassuming insectivorous sundews lurking in swales to the tops of the wind-pruned trees in the Sunken Forest, Fire Island is a varied and most interesting barrier beach ecosystem. This makes taking in a ranger-led interpretive program or tour a must. The Sunken Forest area in particular is a somewhat unusual barrier island situation with several bogs, complete with sphagnum, ferns, mosses, cattails, rushes and other wetland species.  The island is also a wonderful birdwatching (and listening!) venue. Catbirds and eastern towhees keep the music playing and yellow warblers and yellow bellied sapsuckers keep it colorful. Fire Island is a popular rest stop for migratory birds with over 300 species have been recorded here -- over one-third of the birds in North America.  There is a full array of beach dwellers as well and fishing is excellent, particularly in Great South Bay.</field>

		<field name="name">culture</field>
		<field name="content">Florida is the most southern of all U.S. states other than Hawaii and is a unique blend of societies. The northern part of the state is part of the cultural region of  The South , where you will find traditional southern cooking, entertainment, dialect, and lifestyles, much as you would expect to find just north in  Georgia ,  Alabama , and the Carolinas. Generally, the more south you go in the state, the more unlike the South it seems, and you should not expect to experience southern culture everywhere, although southern culture can be found in every region of the state, it is not always the most prominent. Cities such as Tampa and Orlando offer the feel of many different cultures. There are a lot of southerners in these areas, as well as people who are not from the state (midwest, northeast), whereas Miami is unique in seeming like a cross between an American metropolis and a major Latin American city (like Caracas, Rio, or São Paulo). There are some Seminole Indian reserves and villages throughout southern Florida (namely in the Everglades) and their indigenous culture can be experienced by visiting a gift shop and browsing arts and crafts. The southernmost Florida Keys offer yet another flavor, full of the slow paced and casual atmosphere of true beach life. All in all, Florida is its own region of the  United States  in its own right.  The Florida State Fair held every February near Tampa is the best event to attend to sense the varying cultures. The fairgrounds are host to a "cracker" village similar to the villages that were found in rural Florida in the 19th century. It hosts an exposition of counties, where each Florida county has a display and a representative to answer questions. In addition, the fair has animal displays and shows, an exhibition dedicated to citrus, various dance cheerleading competitions, and a large selection of rides and games. A few weeks later, nearby Plant City host the Strawberry Festival, usually the last few days of February and first week of March. Plant City is the "Strawberry Capital of the US" and almost every food vendor at the festival offers several dishes featuring strawberries.  Driving near Plant City in February and March, one can find many roadside vendors offering flats(~$10-12) and half-flats(~$5-8) of strawberries. Another common dish found at roadside vendors in north and central Florida is boiled peanuts-a southern dish usually found in "regular" and "cajun" flavors, which taste nothing like roasted peanut. Floridas Natural, a company that sells fruit juice, has a great roadside "welcome center" along US 27 in Lake Wales that includes a display and video on the history of citrus growing in Florida and offers samples of several flavors of juice.</field>

		<field name="content">Floridas coastline is world class, with several gorgeous beaches, bays, and estuaries lying on the coast. The Floridian landscape is flat, with many lakes and wetlands throughout most parts of the state. The only exception is parts of the center in Highlands, Polk, Lake, and a few other counties where rolling hills are common. The highest point in the state is 345ft (105m) and "Iron mountain" in Polk county is the highest point on the peninsula at 298ft (81m). Floridas cities tend to be big, sprawling, and well developed. For such a highly populated area there are fortunately still several areas of wilderness left (although they are often found sitting right next to a large city). Many rural parts of the state grow citrus and sugar cane, but farmland tends to be far out from the usual tourist areas. The  Florida Panhandle  and  North Florida  is mostly farmland and pine trees, but as you travel south, youll see more wetlands and urbanization.  The  Florida Keys , a small chain of tropical islands, have their own unique geography, surrounded by beautiful blue waters.</field>

		<field name="content">Hurricane Frances makes landfall on the morning of September 5, 2004 near Stuart. Its impact, however, was felt throughout central Florida and most of Floridas east coast.  Florida is known around the world for its balmy weather. The states mild winters have made it a haven for retirees year-round and temporary residents during the winter known as "snowbirds". Summers can be long and hot, with the interior being a few degrees warmer than the immediate coast. Coastal areas also experience gentle breezes during the summer, and the beach is usually the coolest place to be.   While coastal breezes are a welcome relief from the scorching temperatures, they are also the cause of the most notorious Florida weather feature: thunderstorms.  While the storms are often brief, they are common, and anyone visiting Florida during the rainy season (mid-June to September) should plan a few activities indoors in the afternoon as a backup plan. Floridas thunderstorms occur everyday during the rainy season and typically form 20-30mi inland and either move toward the center of the state or toward the coast. While most simply cool the air bringing a welcome relief to stifling temperatures, these storms produce considerable amounts of dangerous lightning and sometimes hail, high winds (50mph+), and tornadoes. See the "stay safe" section for thunderstorm safety. Many attractions such as Disney World have multiple attractions available even during downpours.  It is common to be in a rain shower yet be in the sun at the same time.  It is also an interesting contradiction that rain can be occurring just a few miles inland from the coast, while those at the beach experience a beautiful day.  Average Annual Temperatures:  Summer: 80.5 °F degrees (26.9 °C) (North Florida) 82.7 °F degrees (28.2 °C) (South Florida)  Winter: 53.0 °F degrees (11.7 °C) (North Florida) 68.5 °F degrees (20.3 °C) (South Florida)  The above temperatures are average temperatures throughout the day. During the summer, high temperatures on the peninsula are usually around 90 on the coast and mid 90s inland...with lows ranging from around 80 on the coast to mid 70s inland. During the winter, temperatures are much more variable. Freezing temperatures (below 32ºF/0ºC) occur at least once a year as far south as central Florida, but even on the coldest days will warm back up into the 50s for a high. It is best to consult the individual city page for temperatures during the winter. The spring is the driest time of the year, which can lead to wildfires nearly every May and early June.  The six-month hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30 and Floridians have learned to be ready when a storm threatens the area. If you plan on visiting during the summer, stay abreast of the news and weather advisories.  Information is available from the  National Hurricane Center .</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In 1847, Sallie Daugherty came from Arkansas with her four sons and purchased 1,000 acres of land four miles southeast of present-day Forney, naming the area Union Hill. This area later became known as Lone Elm. In 1848, Kaufman County was carved out of the huge Nacogdoches County.   In the early 1850s, more settlers began to arrive in this area. By 1860, many hardy settlers entered booming Texas, mainly from the South. Hearing of the good land of the rolling prairies of this North Central Texas area, many stopped here and began their lives as farmers and ranchers. The small village that began to spring up near the rim of the bluff that overlooked the Bois DArc Fork of the Trinity River was to be named Brooklyn.   By 1873, Brooklyn was a growing town, with saloons, merchandise store, lodge, and was being supported by a few hundred people. It was the year that the Texas and Pacific Railroad come through Brooklyn, which was to change the face of our town forever.  As the town progressed, through the influence the Railroad provided, it was now ready for a Post Office to satisfy the residents needs. The name of Brooklyn was submitted to the Post Office Department in Washington, D.C., however, another town by the same name with a Post Office was already established in Fayette County, so another name had to be selected for our town if it wished postal service.   Changing of a town name was unusual, even in 1873. John Wein Forney, born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1817, was a director of the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company and was believed to have been instrumental in the new railroad route through the village of Brooklyn.   In gratitude to Mr. Forney, several influential residents suggested Forneys name be submitted as a Post Office, and it was accepted. Thus the name of the town of Forney was established permanently.  The prairies that surrounded the town were covered with a native grass that was found to produce a sweet, nutritious hay when cut and baled. For the next 50 years "Forney Prairie Hay" as it was known, was one of the leading export products of Forney.  When the peak of the hay industry had been reached, cotton took its place. Money and wealth came to many large landowners from hay and then cotton. By 1910, Forney boasted of eight cotton gins, the most for its size of any town in Texas. Fifteen to twenty thousand bales of cotton were ginned each fall and shipped to cotton markets across the United States.  The new Dixie Highway (U.S. 80) opened through Forney in the late 1920s, resulting in better automobile travel in this area. The Texas Interurban Railway Company began operations in 1923 on its Dallas-Forney-Terrell rail line. Running through Forney on Church Street, this streetcar-type electric rail line served for 10 years as an advanced commuter type service, a source unequaled before or since.  During the 1940-1950 period, the town came virtually to a standstill, due primarily to the Second World War. Very few, if any, new businesses were opened in the city. Many larger companies chose Garland and Mesquite during the post-war period, after considering Forney as a prospective home. Little residential building was recorded and the town slumbered as many of its neighbors grew like wildfire.  The area north of the new Interstate Highway 20 was exclusively farmland in the 1960s. Today it composes a major residential section of Forney. During the late 1960s, a new elementary school was completed in South Forney and the city became a three-school town. It was during the 60s that the Forney High School jackrabbit football team won approximately 100 games in a ten-year period, one of the winningest records in Texas and a proud heritage of Forney athletes.  In the late 1960s, Glenn "Red" Whaley opened the first antique business in east Forney, the genesis of the huge antique business the city boasts today. Forney has now been recognized by the Texas Senate as the "Antique Capital of Texas" (Senate Resolution 101 - July, 1987).  Today these flavors all blend together with rural farmers and suburban-ites all calling Forney home.</field>

		<field name="content">Fort Lauderdale has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are very humid with temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s lasting into early fall.  The city sees most of its rainfall in the summer (the wet season). Winter is warm and mild and mainly dry (the dry season) with mild temperatures that are occasionally broken up by some rain when cold fronts come through.   May to September is the summer wet season.  During the summer, it is warm and humid, with the prevailing wind bringing tropical breezes blowing up from the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and equatorial Atlantic. It is often clear and sunny in the mornings but as the land heats up the air rises and the sea breeze kicks in.  This brings in more damp moist air from the sea and so by noon it often starts to cloud over, and then there are commonly short showers in the afternoon, which helps to cool the air off for a cooler and generally dryer evening. The Atlantic hurricane season largely occurs from late July through early November, with peak activity generally occurring from mid-August through early October.   Fort Lauderdale, positioned just above the Tropic of Cancer, owes a lot of its winter warmth to the Gulf Stream that runs just a couple of miles off shore.  The Gulf Stream brings warm water up from the tropics year-round.   On a typical summer day the temperature does not get below 75 ºF (24 ºC).  Summer temperatures are commonly in the high 80s to low 90s (30-35 °C), which is often relieved by the sea breeze, which in turn brings some afternoon thunderstorms.   During winter, humidity is significantly lower.  The average daily high in the winter is usually between 65 and 75 °F (18-24 °C) and the low normally around 59 ºF (15 ºC), rarely dipping below 40 ºF (4 ºC) when a front comes through.  Fort Lauderdale receives abundant rainfall, most of it falling in the summer. The annual total of 63.8 inches (1488 mm) is one of the highest for a U.S. city.  This sounds a lot, but it does not rain that much, its just that when it does rain it really chucks it down, a real tropical downpour.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">According to a handbook authored by Francis Asbury Hendry who lived from 1833 – 1917, Fort Myers first appears in about 1841 when it was first manned as Fort Harvey.  The military fort was abandoned in 1842 then, re-established in 1850 and named in honor of a U.S. Army officer named Abraham C. Myers, a Colonel.   The fort was a center for command and control operations during war against the native Indian tribes that lived in Florida until they were defeated and, relocated out of the state to regions of western United States.   However, some of the Seminole Indian tribe never surrendered and remained in the Florida wilderness.  Colonel Myers reportedly resigned his commission and joined the Confederate army when the Civil War started.  Under Confederate control, African slaves were transported to the area from Virginia to support cultivation of crops.  During the Civil War, the fort changed hands between forces of the North and South once or twice more.  An African-American Infantry of Union soldiers was stationed in Fort Myers during the period of 1863 to 1864.  Under the authority of Monroe County, the first school for African-Americans in the area was formed near Fort Myers, on the property an emancipated slave by the name of Nelson Tillis in 1885.  Although Thomas Edison operated telegraph services for the northern side of the Civil War, in 1886, Edison purchased a winter home in Fort Myers after marrying his second wife earlier that year (National Park Service, 2012).  In 1890, the first female African-American school teacher (Annie Moore), was hired to teach in the area (Lee County Black History Society, 2011).  A county entitled Lee County, named so in honor of the southern commanding General, Robert E. Lee was established in 1887.  By about 1908, the population of Fort Myers was approximately five to six thousand (Captain F.A. Hendry Reunion Committee, 2002).  In 1912 the first local Black population only public school was established in Lee County (Williams Academy).  Henry Ford bought the home and land next door to Thomas Edison in 1916.  In 1920 the Jones-Walker Hospital was opened for the Black population only.  Bunche Beach was dedicated as the first local beach intended for the Black population only, in 1949. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled to end segregation in public schools.  However, this decision was not implemented by integrating local Lee County schools until 1969.  The Williams Academy was relocated to Clemente Park located in the Dunbar section of Fort Myers in 1995 and, is the primary center for African-American history in Lee County.  The museum and administrative offices are established at 1936 Henderson Avenue (Lee County Black History Society, 2011).   Fort Myers Black History Society Museum entrance view.   Fort Myers Black History Society Museum, Clemente Park view.  The 2010 total census population of the city of Fort Myers was 62,298 (United States Census Bureau, 2010).  This population figure does not include seasonal residents or, residents of Lee County outside of the city limits.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Four Corners site   The genesis of Four Corners as a novelty on a map dates back to 1846, when the U.S. Army invaded and defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. With the Treaty of Guadalupe y Hidalgo, the U.S. gained control of  California ,  Nevada , Utah, as well as portions of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and  Wyoming .   Twenty-two years later, as Colorado prepared for statehood and admission into the Union, Four Corners was first surveyed by the U.S. Government Surveyors and Astronomers. This initial 1868 survey demarcated Colorados southern boundary line. In 1878, New Mexicos west boundary and Utahs east boundary were surveyed and added. With the inclusion of the Arizona Territory boundary, the site became known as Four Corners.   The original survey monument, a sandstone marker, was erected in 1899, and was replaced with a small metal and cement marker in 1912. The northern boundary of the state of Arizona was surveyed in 1901.   Four Corners was originally declared by Congress at a different latitude and longitude, but an early surveying error misplaced the location. The U.S. Supreme Court had to wade into the bureaucratic mess, ruling that the current location was so popular, it should be recognized as the boundary between the four states.   For most of the 20th century, the Monument was very simple, consisting of three steps up to a concrete pad, with a few posts and highway guard rails surrounding it. The Monument received a facelift in 1992 and now includes a flat slab of granite embedded with an aluminum bronze marker, as well as surrounding state flags and state seals. The Navajo and Ute nation flags are represented, as well. An inscription in the granite reads, "Four states here meet in freedom under God." Just outside the monument, there are "welcome and goodbye" border signs for all four states.   In 1999, Congress appropriated money to Four Corners to improve the visitors center and build bathrooms with running water. Unfortunately, the project became entangled in various state and federal agencies, as well as squabbling between the tribal councils of the Ute and Navajo nations. It still remains unbuilt.  In May 2009, it was in correctly reported by the new media that a survey done by the National Geodetic Survey    had discovered that the original survey done in 1878 was incorrect. The actual borders between Colorado and Utah were reported to be 2.5 miles to the west. Congress and the States involved agreed to change the original longitude and latitude to match the marker. (The 109th Western Meridian was originally set as the boundary between Colorado and Utah.) Thus rendering the original survey invalid.</field>

Dating from about 1805, it became a center for lumber and furniture industries. Gardner is known as the "Chair City" and "The Furniture Capital of New England", due to its long history in furniture production. By 1910 it had 20 chair factories which produced 4 million chairs per year. It was also noted for silversmithing. The Gardner State Colony for the Insane pioneered the use of cottage residences.

		<field name="content">Gateway was established on October 27, 1972 as the countrys first urban National Park. Jamaica Bay had been developed as a wildlife refuge by the New York City Parks Department beginning in the early 1950s with the creation of two large ponds and the planting of trees, shrubs and grasses. This excellent and extensive refuge is combined in Gateway NRA with much military history:  Floyd Bennett Field is significant in the history of civil and military aviation. It was New York Citys first municipal airport. Floyd Bennett Field as Naval Air Station New York defended the nation and its ships from 1941 to 1971.    Fort Tilden is the last of a long line of fortifications that stood on the Rockaway peninsula, ready to defend the United States from attack from the sea and air. The site witnessed the use of the most technologically advanced weaponry of the period including smooth-bore cannons, sixteen inch naval rifles, and anti-aircraft missiles.   Jacob Riis Park was the site of Rockaway Naval Air Station, significant for its relationship to the famous NC-4 crossing of the Atlantic. This historic crossing ultimately changed commercial aviation.   Fort Wadsworth, important military high ground since the 1600s, was the oldest continuously used military site in the country when closed in 1994. Still used by the Coast Guard today it displays remnants of old fortifications.  Miller Field gained recognition as an airfield during World War I. Today the Elm Tree Light and an airplane hangar are all that remain, but dozens of athletic fields provide recreational opportunities.  Fort Hancocks guns and missile defenses and Sandy Hook Light also had a part in defending New York Harbor.</field>

Maps, guides, trail brochures and display rooms are available in the Visitor Center. Park Rangers give interpretive talks and lead nature walks year-round. Trails, benches, blinds and gardens provide "habitat" for human visitors. In 1980 a butterfly reserve was set aside and planted with attractant plants. Native species of frogs and peepers have been reintroduced. Egrets, heron, ibis and other waterfowl abound in the salt marshes. Tree swallows, kestrels, wrens, osprey, and a large population of barn owls also have been encouraged. In all, over 325 species of birds have been recorded here. All the usual shoreline and coastline suspects such as crabs, mollusks, and turtles are found here, too.  Reed grasses, beach grasses and native meadow plants such as bayberry and milkweed are found here as well. The "Upland Trail", in particular, explores some of the bushes and trees such as the Autumn Olive, Hackberry, Japanese Black Pine, Tree of Heaven, Eastern White Pine, Black Cherry, European Alder, Gray Birch, Sassafras, Holly and others.</field>

		<field name="content">As the 150th anniversary of the American Revolution neared, interest in celebrating the accomplishments of George Rogers Clark grew. May 23, 1928 President Coolidge signed a resolution starting the George Rogers Clark Commission to create a monument to celebrate Clark. June 14, 1936, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the memorial. In 1966 it became part of the National Park Service.   The memorial itself stands more than 80 feet high and 90 feet across at its base. The walls are two thick wide, made of granite from Vermont, Minnesota and Alabama. 16 Doric columns go around the building with inscriptions celebrating the life of Clark.   Inside the memorial are seven murals painted by Ezra Winter at 16x28 feet. The murals depict Clarks remarkable 18-day journey and the events that it entailed. In the middle is a bronze sculpture of Clark by Hermon Atkins, standing over 7 feet tall. Qoutes and dates are placed in and out of the building on the walls, discussing the life and death and accomplishments of Clark. He was only 25 years old when these events took place, immortalizing him.   George Rogers Clark captured Fort Sackville from British Lt. Governor Henry Hamilton on Feb. 25, 1779, this is considered one fo the most important moments of the American Revolution, leading to Clarks march on the Mississippi River, solidifying Americas future in the Northwest.</field>

		<field name="content">The battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1-3, 1863. The fighting started accidentally when Union and Confederate troops converged just north of the town of Gettysburg. Three bloody days of fighting ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Confederate forces fell back after Lees final frontal assault broke on the third day. After touring the three days of Gettysburg, follow the Confederate Retreat through Fairfield, just 8 miles west of Gettyburg on PA Route 116, through beautiful rolling countryside and farms. As you drive the 8 miles try to imagine a soldier who has just participated in what will become the largest battle ever fought in North America, tired, hungry, possibly wounded, retreating from the Union in a driving rain storm through mud into the town of Fairfield — most likely the longest 8 miles ever marched! The town, itself, was raided by the Confederates in 1862 and during the retreat on July 4, 1863. It is worth the drive. You can pick up an area tour guide and map at the Fairfield Inn located in the center of town.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Glacier Bay was first surveyed in detail in 1794 by a team from the H.M.S. Discovery, captained by George Vancouver.  At the time the survey produced showed a mere indentation in the shoreline.  That massive glacier was more than 4,000 feet thick in places, up to 20 miles wide, and extended more than 100 miles to the St. Elias mountain range.  By 1879, however, naturalist John Muir discovered that the ice had retreated more than 30 miles forming an actual bay.  By 1916, the Grand Pacific Glacier – the main glacier credited with carving the bay – had melted back 60 miles to the head of what is now Tarr Inlet.  Efforts for protection of Glacier Bay were made by John Muir and other conservationists, and in 1925 President Calvin Coolidge signed a proclamation creating Glacier Bay National Monument.  At the time the monument contained less than half the area of the present park.  In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act elevated the monument to national park status and also extended the park boundary northwest to the Alsek River and Dry Bay. Further protection and recognition of Glacier Bays significance occurred in 1986, when the Glacier Bay-Admiralty Island Biosphere Reserve was established under the United Nations Man and the Biosphere Program. In 1992 Glacier Bay became part of an international  World Heritage Site , along with neighboring  Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve  and Canadas  Kluane National Park .</field>

		<field name="content">The park has snow-capped mountain ranges rising to over 15,000 feet, coastal beaches with protected coves, deep fjords, tidewater glaciers, coastal and estuarine waters, and freshwater lakes.   Steep, sculpted peaks and scoured, rock-strewn valleys show scars of glacial activity and mark the advances and retreats of glaciers dating back over 115,000 years to before the Wisconsin Ice Age.  The sheltered waters of Glacier Bay ebb and flow with the region’s huge tides, which can change as much as 25 feet during a six-hour period.  Ocean waves pound the beaches of the wild and remote Gulf of Alaska coast.  Between the bay and the coast, snow-clad peaks of the Fairweather Range capture the moisture coming in off the Gulf of Alaska and, in turn, spawn the park’s largest glaciers.  At the base of these lofty peaks, deglaciated foothills and outwash plains rapidly turn green as the ice retreats and seeds find their way to the newly revealed land.</field>

		<field name="content">Orcas (also known as killer whales) on the prowl in Glacier Bay.  Each summer humpback whales return to the bay from their wintering grounds near Hawaii to feed on the abundant small schooling fish such as sand lance and juvenile pollack.  Minke and killer whales along with harbor and Dalls porpoises also feed in the parks productive near-shore waters. Steller sea lions congregate on rocky islands to mate or to rest. Thousands of harbor seals breed and nurture their pups on the floating ice in Johns Hopkins Inlet and among the rocky reefs of the Beardslee Islands. Sea otters are rapidly colonizing Glacier Bay as well as park waters in Icy Strait and Cross Sound.  Many land animals also use the marine environment for foraging and travel.  Moose and bears, for example, are accomplished long-distance swimmers that are frequently seen "dog paddling" their way across the bay.  Bears work the beaches when the tide is low turning over rocks looking for tasty barnacles, clams and other intertidal life.  Wolves and coyotes find the traveling easier along the edge of tall beach grass rather than fighting through alder thickets.  At times, even the most upland of animals like marmots and mountain goats are drawn to the waters edge to nibble seaweed or to lick salt spray off beach rocks.  Mountain goats and brown bears were quick to reinvade after the glaciers retreat, while coyote, moose and wolves have moved in more recently.  Black bears prowl the forested portions of the lower bay, and the glacier bear, a rare color phase of the black bear, is occasionally spotted.  River otters are widespread along with marten, mink and weasel, while the wolverine is scarcer and rarely sighted.  The Alsek River delta in Glacier Bay National Preserve is home to lynx, snowshoe hare and beaver -- species that have reached the coast from the interior by traveling along the river corridor.  Seabirds spend most of their time searching for food in the marine waters and come ashore only to rest or to breed.  Thousands of seabirds nest on cliffs and rocky shores within the bay or on the parks outer coast.  Molting and migrating geese and sea ducks find refuge in quiet arms of the bay.  Bald eagles nest in tall cottonwood trees or on cliffs along much of the parks shoreline. Newly vegetated hillsides support great numbers of nesting songbirds, including many neotropical migrants.  The shallow waters and sloping beaches of the Beardslee Islands are important foraging and breeding areas for shorebirds, seabirds, and waterfowl.  Arctic terns and jaegers prefer the barren glacial outwashes near the glaciers for nest sites.   It is believed that nearly 200 species of fish may swim in Park waters.  Many, including all five species of Pacific salmon, are well-known, while others have yet to be documented.  Many fishes are associated with deep water or "subtidal benthic" communities, and several of these are identified with important fisheries such as Pacific halibut, rockfish, lingcod, Pacific cod, sablefish and pollock.  Glacier Bay is blanketed by a mosaic of plant life, from a few pioneer species in recently exposed areas to intricately balanced climax communities in coastal and alpine regions. Since virtually all the vegetation in the bay has returned to the land in the past 300 years following the retreat of the glaciers, this area is one of the premier sites on the planet to study plant recolonization.</field>

		<field name="content">Glacier Bay has a maritime climate, heavily influenced by ocean currents. The result is mild winter temperatures and cool summer temperatures near sea level. Summer visitors can expect highs between of 50-to-60 degrees F (10-to-15 degrees C). Winter temperatures rarely drop into the single digits, with average nighttime lows of 25-to-40 degrees F (-2 to 5 degrees C).  Bartlett Cove receives about 70 inches of precipitation annually.  April, May and June are usually the driest months of the year while September and October tend to be the wettest.  All this moisture helps to create the lush temperate rainforests of the lower bay.  Unlike the areas at sea level, conditions in the mountains are more severe with colder temperatures and more precipitation that takes the form of snow. It’s all that snow falling year after year that goes into creating the magnificent glaciers we love to see.</field>

		<field name="content">Colorado boasts the southernmost moose population in  North America , and is home to the smallest subspecies of moose, Alces alces shirasi, or Shiras Moose. The North Park area surrounding Gould is home to over 600 Shiras moose, observable year round.  Colorado moose are about the size of a horse and can weigh up to 1,000 pounds. While they may seem sluggish or placid in appearance, moose can also be highly territorial. If they feel threatened and charge, moose run up to speeds of 35 miles per hour.  Their favorite haunts are in marshy spots along rivers, streams and beaver ponds, where moose feed upon willows and aquatic plants.</field>

		<field name="content">Throughout the past century, hundreds of authors have attempted to depict the enormous landscape that is Grand Canyon.  Not surprisingly, words most often fail to invoke the sense of awe and wonder that many visitors experience.  Edward Abbey, a noted Southwest author, once penned:  "Those who love it call it the canyon.  The canyon.  As if there were no other topographic feature on the face of the Earth".  There are, of course, other canyons on the planet.  Some are longer, others wider, and even some that are deeper.  Canyon visitors are often surprised to learn that Grand Canyon sets no records for sheer size.  It is, however, simply regarded by most as the "grandest" canyon of them all.  Geologically, the canyon extends from Lees Ferry near the Arizona/Utah border to the Grand Wash Cliffs near Las Vegas, a distance of 277nbsp;mi (445nbsp;km).  It ranges in width from about a quarter mile to over 18nbsp;mi (29nbsp;km) wide.  In places the canyon is over a mile deep.  However, it is not the statistics that define this landscape as "grand", but rather a combination of factors.  The desert environment and a lack of herbaceous ground cover reveal a geologic story that is unparalleled.  Surprisingly, the rock layers displayed at Grand Canyon show little sign of wear.  The layers have been preserved almost perfectly, as though they were layers in a cake.  Nowhere else on Earth displays so many volumes of the planets history in such pristine condition.  The resulting landscape provides visitors with some of the most magnificent and unsurpassed vistas on the planet.</field>

		<field name="content">A raven sitting near the canyon edge   Arguably, the most famous animal in the park is the rare California Condor. They can occasionally be seen flying near Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim.  Common bird life includes Canyon Wrens, Stellars Jays (with their peaked caps), swallows, hummingbirds, and the playful and entertaining Raven.  Mule Deer are common.  Some of the largest Elk in North America can be found in the national park, and in the adjacent Kaibab National Forest.  Desert Big Horn Sheep are also seen on occasion, mainly in the inner canyon.  Youll often spot Coyote no matter where you are in the park, and if youre lucky, youll get to hear them sing.  Other predators are Mountain Lions and Bobcat.  Black Bears are rare, and they generally stay away from the inhabited areas.  Some of the smaller creatures that can be found in the inhabited areas of the park are the Ringtail (called a cat, but not in the cat family), which like to live in the rafters of some of the historic buildings on the rim.  They are quick and stealthy, but they often forget how visible that tail is, and youll see it hanging out over a  beam.  A favorite with visitors is the Aberts Squirrel with their tufted ears.  Other varieties of squirrels and chipmunks are also popular. They seem tame and like to beg for food behind the Bright Angel Lodge, near the Ice Cream fountain.  But heed the warnings and resist the urge.  One of the most common injuries in the park are squirrel bites.  You might also see the common Striped Skunk, and if lucky, you might even see the rarer Western Spotted Skunk (usually at lower elevations).  Skunks here are also habituated to humans and may seem tame, but they will react as all skunks do, so dont come up on them suddenly!  For the reptile family, there are variety of small lizards, and a few snakes. The most striking (in more ways than one) is the Grand Canyon Rattlesnake; with its reddish (almost pink) coloring it neatly blends into the rocky terrain of the canyon. They are interesting to see as long as it is at a safe distance.  Rattlesnakes are MORE afraid of you than you are of them. If given the chance, they will avoid any contact with humans. Most rattlesnake victims are young males that are chasing or trying to capture a snake.  Do not feed the animals.  It is unhealthy for them, and may be unhealthy for you. A seemingly tame squirrel might bite you—they carry plague, rabies, etc.  A deer or elk can charge at you without warning.  If the animal is aware of your presence, youre too close.</field>

This is a land of extremes.  It can be snowing at the rim, while others are comfortable sunbathing at the river.  Conversely, it can be cool and comfortable at the rim in the summer, while temperatures at the river exceed 120°F (49°C).  It is not unusual for local canyon guides to encounter neophyte hikers in desperate shape.  Some die.  An unusual number of fatalities occur among young people who overestimate their abilities.  The months of July and August are monsoon season in Arizona and strong thunderstorms can sweep in quickly with lightning strikes every few minutes and sudden downpours.  Due to the elevation of the Grand Canyon rims, people are struck by lightning fairly regularly so take shelter indoors during storms.</field>

		<field name="content">Between 250 and 1300 AD, the Fremont people were the area’s first inhabitants. Their culture can still be glimpsed today in the many petroglyphs and pictographs they created on canyon walls. Circa 1500, the Ute nation moved into the Grand Valley.   With the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish formed the Viceroyalty of New Spain and claimed a large part of North America for themselves, including the Grand Valley.  As Spanish settlers established colonies along the Rio Grande River in  New Mexico  during the 1590s, they introduced horses to various Native American nations. It was the Utes turn in the 1630s. Through both bartering and theft, the Utes acquired their horses from the Spanish. This transformed Ute society as they became skilled horsemen.  The first Europeans arrived in the Grand Valley in 1776, when the Dominguez-Escalante expedition passed through the area. Silvestre Vélez de Escalante was a Franciscan friar who attempted to discover an overland trade route between  Santa Fe , New Mexico and  Monterey ,  California . After six grueling months, the expedition was abandoned and Escalante returned to Santa Fe through  Arizona .  In 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain successfully revolted, splitting with the Spanish crown. The Grand Valley became part of Alta California, a province in the new nation of  Mexico .  Hoping to develop the area, Mexican officials opened the land up to mountain men, trappers and traders. Between 1821 and 1840, explorer Antoine Robidoux ventured through the Grand Valley in search of beaver pelts. Robidoux built Fort Umcompahgre (then known as Fort Robidoux) near present-day  Delta . With this influx of adventurers and speculators came many of the men who would later lead U.S. Army expeditions and Government Surveying parties through the region: Kit Carson, John Charles Fremont and Captain John Gunnison.  In 1846, the U.S. Army invaded and defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. With the Treaty of Guadalupe y Hidalgo, the U.S. gained control of the Grand Valley, as well as California,  Nevada ,  Utah , and portions of Arizona, New Mexico and  Wyoming .  Friction between the Utes and whites over resources was inevitable. In 1868, the U.S. Government and the Ute Indians signed a treaty that designated the Grand Valley as part of the Ute reservation. But the Grand Valleys rivers offered both a reliable source of water and arable land. This was compounded by the discovery of gold in the San Juan Mountains to the south. These factors proved to be too great for the settlers to resist. Eventually the Utes were pressured to leave the area. After the Utes forced relocation, settlers poured into the area.  In 1882, the City of Grand Junction was founded. The railroad came to town a few months later. Canals were dug to tap into the Grand and Gunnison Rivers, and Grand Junction built its economy on farming and ranching.  In 1900, dinosaur bones were discovered at Riggs Hill to the west of town by Elmer S. Riggs, Assistant Curator of Paleontology at the Field Museum in Chicago. Huge Jurassic era dinosaurs like bracchiosaurus, apatosaurus, allosaurus, and stegosaurus were pried from the desert soil.  By the mid-20th century, Grand Junction began to ride out a series of boom-and-bust cycles related to mining. In the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission set up shop in town to buy uranium for making atomic bombs. Over 35 mining companies used Grand Junction as a base to mine the radioactive element found throughout the Colorado Plateau. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, oil shale was discovered on the Roan Plateau east of Grand Junction. This boom came to a crashing halt in 1982, leaving the Grand Valley in a decade long local recession.  In the last 25 years, the Grand Valley was discovered as an optimal place to grow wine grapes. An eclectic mix of aging hippies, hopeless romantics, artists and entrepreneurs flocked to the area. They all shared a common dream of creating a wine culture in Western Colorado. Slowly, with a lot of trial and error, this core group of self-taught winemakers began growing grapes and crafting award winning wines.  Grand Junction now serves as a recreational hub for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts. Leisure travelers can hike, camp or enjoy boating and fishing in the surrounding national parks, forests and recreation areas.</field>

		<field name="content">The mild, sunny days of spring and fall are why people move to this mini-sunbelt. Late March is usually when the fruit orchards blossom, with the days averaging about 70°F (21°C) and the nights in about 40°F (4°C). Spring barrel tastings happen at many of the vineyards in April and May, and are accompanied by food and wine pairings. High season occurs during the summer months of June, July and August. Late summer can range around 90 to 100°F (32 to 37°C) in this desert biome, but is well worth the visit because the peaches and other fruit crops fill the fruit stands throughout the region. September is harvest time for the grapes. The third week in September is also the height of the fall color season in Colorado, when the aspen and cottonwood trees change many brilliant colors of yellow, red and orange. October is a shoulder season where the weather is usually decent, but minus the crowds and high hotel prices. November through February are the slow months, when the Grand Valley shuts down for the winter. Bargain hunters can still book hotel rooms at drastically reduced prices, while a majority of the wineries and tasting rooms remain open. Be sure to call ahead, however. Western Colorado is home to an oil shale and natural gas boom, and many hotels are already full of energy workers needed to work the fields.</field>

For many years it received only token protection and was not part of the national park system, but threats to develop it for mining and commercial use led the Clinton administration to place it in National Monument status in 1996. This was done without consulting area residents and was not seen favorably in Republican-dominated Utah.  It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, rather than by the National Park Service.</field>

		<field name="content">In the late 1800s, Colonel S.B.M. Young, the acting Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, suggested the expansion of Yellowstones park boundaries towards the south. During the following years, various officials introduced a series of proposals to include the Teton mountain range and Jackson Lake in an enlarged Yellowstone. These proposals were met with fierce opposition by local ranchers, who feared that an expanded park would lead to cuts in their grazing areas.  Around this same time, farmers in the region suggested the damming of Two Ocean, Emma Matilda and Jenny Lakes for irrigation purposes. Ranchers became concerned that if the lakes were dammed, it could lead to the destruction of natural resources by way of increased commercial development. This concern led to a key meeting in 1923, when Yellowstone Superintendent Horace Albright and some local residents decided that they could pool private funds to buy up land. This way, they could lock the land away from developers and preserve the natural character of the Jackson Hole region.  Albright was the only person at the meeting who openly supported a national park. The other attendees wanted to make sure that they could continue to use the land for hunting and ranching. As time went by, public support for a national park grew. This support wasnt unanimous, and there were still many holdouts who would not sell their land to the government. Nonetheless, on February 26, 1929, Grand Teton National Park was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge.  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. became enamored of the Jackson Hole area and decided to help with Superintendent Albrights plan. Rockefeller created a private company as a front to buy land, using the company to hide both his personal involvement and any links to the federal government. That way, local residents would sell their land to the company, not knowing that it was in fact going to be donated to the National Park Service.  When the true nature of Rockefellers front company became publicly known, it caused outrage in the area. After many legal battles, this controversy was put to rest with a compromise that allowed limited hunting and grazing within the park, as well as the existence of some privately run guest ranches.</field>

The southern end of the valley averages 15 feet of snow in the winter and often reaches balmy 80 degree temperatures in the summer. Temperatures in higher elevations average four degrees Fahrenheit cooler every 1,000 feet in rise.   Raingear is recommended during spring, summer and fall. Sub-zero temperatures are common throughout winter and demand multi-layered clothing, hats, mittens and cold weather boots.   Vehicles with four-wheel drive or all-weather tires are recommended for winter travel, roads may be closed during blizzards. Drive at or below posted speed limits at all times; moose and other wildlife are often seen crossing roads during the winter.  Winter doesn’t officially set in until December 21, but the first heavy snows may fall by November 1. Between winter storms the days are sunny and the nights are frigid. Average temperatures range from a daily maximum of 29°F to a minimum of 6°F. Ask at the Moose Visitor Center for road closures during blizzards.  During spring mild days and cool nights frequently come with rain or snow. The spring months average 11 days with measurable precipitation. Temperatures typically range from 22°F to 49° F. Valley trails remain snow-covered until late May.   Between the months of June through August the average daily temperature is 76°F, but high-elevation hiking trails don’t melt out until mid-July. Nighttime temperatures can reach the lower 40s. Most of the year’s precipitation falls during the summer months; afternoon thunderstorms are common.  Sun and occasional rain and snow fill the short fall days. The average daily maximum is 54°F while the minimum average is a cool 25°F. The fall months average 23 days that drop below freezing. For a comfortable trip, bring plenty of layered clothing.</field>

		<field name="content">Great Sand Dunes National Monument was one of the many United States national parks and monuments created during the Great Depression (1932).  In its original form it covered only the dunes themselves.  However, it has expanded significantly since its roots, due in large part to concern among residents of nearby communities about the need to protect the watershed containing the dunes.  Recent actions in 2000 and 2004 led first to the creation of a "preserve" adjoining the monument, and then to the designation of the combined monument/preserve as a full-fledged national park.</field>

Summer nights are surprisingly cool thanks to the elevation of 8200 above sea level, with lows sometimes dropping into the 40s.  Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with associated winds and lightning. Be prepared to leave the dunes promptly if thunderstorms threaten: lightning strikes are common and may be fatal.  Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days. Highs average in the 60s - 70s °F, with chilly nights in the 20s - 30s °F. Be prepared, though, for the occasional cold fall storm, bringing icy rain or even snow.  Cold temperatures are the norm in winter, even though sunshine is generally abundant. The lowest temperature recorded at Great Sand Dunes was -25 deg;F in 1963. Average highs are in the 20s-40s °F, with lows averaging -5 to 15 deg;F. Snow may fall and high winds may occasionally occur, so bring warm, layered clothing and sturdy footwear.  Spring can bring high winds; March, April, and May winds are unstable and can be unusually strong. Temperatures can vary widely: highs may reach into the 60s °F, or only into the 30s °F with an even colder windchill. Lows can also vary from 0 deg;F to the 30s °F. March and April are the snowiest months of the year, but some days in spring can also be swimsuit weather.  The average annual precipitation is 11 inches including an average snowfall of 37 inches.  Overall, precipitation increases in all directions as you leave the heart of the San Luis Valley.  Yearly there are only 30–40 days when clouds obstruct the sun the majority of the day. The valley is known as the "Land of Cool Sunshine", and lives up to that name throughout most of the year.</field>

More than $11 million was required to make all of the purchases.  The main benefactor, who came to rescue during the Great Depression, was the Rockefeller family which donated $5 million.  This great deed was honored by the erection of a memorial at Newfound Gap.  The park was officially dedicated on September 2, 1940 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</field>

		<field name="content">March through May: Spring brings with it unpredictable weather. Changes occur rapidly - sunny skies can yield to snow flurries in a few hours. March is the month with the most radical changes; snow can fall at any time during the month, particularly in the higher elevations. Temperatures in the lower elevations have a mean high of 61°F. Low temperatures, which are often below freezing, have a mean of 42°F. By mid-April the weather is usually milder. Daytime temperatures often reach the 70s and occasionally the 80s. Below freezing temperatures at night are uncommon in the lower elevations but still occur higher up. April averages over four inches of rain, usually in the form of afternoon showers. May is warmer, with daytime highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the 40s and 50s. May rainfall averages about 4.5 inches.</field>

Temperatures increase through the period with July and August afternoon highs in the 90s in the lower elevations. Evening lows are usually comfortable with readings in the 60s and 70s. In the higher elevations, the weather is much more pleasant. On Mount Le Conte (6,593 elevation), no temperature above 80 degrees has ever been recorded.</field>

Daytime highs are usually in the 70s and 80s during September, falling to the 50s and 60s in early November. The first frosts often occur in late September. By November, the lows are usually near freezing. This is the driest period of the year with only occasional rain showers. In the higher elevations, snow is a possibility by November.</field>

		<field name="content">Mid-November through February: Winter in the Smokies is generally moderate, but extremes in weather do occur, especially with an increase in elevation. It is not unusual to have warm temperatures in the low elevations and snow in the higher areas. About half the days in the winter have high temperatures of 50 degrees or more. Highs occasionally even reach the 70s. Most nights have lows at or below freezing. But lows of -20°F. are possible at high elevations. In the low elevations, snows of 1" or more occur 1-5 times a year. Snow falls more frequently in the higher mountains and up to two feet can fall during a storm. January and February are the months when one is most likely to find snow in the mountains.</field>

Temperatures can easily vary 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit from mountain base to top, and clear skies lower down do not guarantee equally pleasant weather at higher elevations. Rainfall averages 55 inches per year in the lowlands to 85 inches per year at Clingmans Dome.</field>

And despite the heavy forest, there are plenty of open areas, wetlands, and escarpments where wildlife tend to gather. As with all national forest land, there are parts set aside for recreation, logging, and mining, as well as areas that are totally closed off to protect wildlife.  Trails and roads in the forest are well maintained and range from very scenic to mosquito-ridden.</field>

They are mostly covered by northern deciduous forests (maples, oaks, birches, etc) but also have patches of coniferous forest, wetlands, tundra, grassy ski slopes, and powerline greenways.  Each of these areas has its own collection of flora and fauna.  Thousands of bird species flock to these well-protected mountains and the bird-watching can really be excellent, especially in the clearings where birds come to feed and mate.  Mammals in the national forest are more reclusive but abound in large numbers, and if youre lucky you might see a moose, black bear, coyote, fox, or Indiana Bat.</field>

		<field name="name">landscape</field>
		<field name="content">Upon approaching Guadalupe Mountains National Park, the mountains and surrounding desert flats appear very rugged and desolate.  There are no trees visible- only boulders, cacti, and a few hardy shrubs.  Once you hike up into the mountains, you will find an extremely different environment with temperate and alpine forests, streams, grassy meadows, and a wide variety of plants and animals.  Views of the mountains are stunning from the parking lots, but by far the best views are to be had atop the mountains, with views of over a hundred miles common.  The Guadalupe Mountains, or "Guads" in local parlance, are formed of limestone laid down in a vast, prehistoric reef and subsequently fossilized.  The most prominent summit is El Capitan (no connection to the feature of the same name in  Yosemite National Park , but similarly imposing) at the southern end of the range; nearby Guadalupe Peak is higher (the highest mountain in Texas), but less conspicuous.  The limestone composition of the Guads creates challenges for the hiker, as the rock tends to break into chunks that are rapidly worn smooth and behave like ball bearings underfoot.  This is a good park in which to wear sturdy hiking boots when youre on the trails.  The Guads continue north into  New Mexico  and contain a great number of caves, including the famous Carlsbad Caverns; Guadalupe Mountains National Park contains a few of these caves, but in general theyre smaller and less spectacular than the ones on the New Mexico side of the state line, and in any event are not generally open to the public.</field>

		<field name="content">The park is largely covered with the usual flora of the Chihuahuan desert (prickly-pear cactus, ocotillo, various yuccas, etc.), but one of its more startling features is a significant stand of native maple trees, quite an outlier in this ecosystem.  The maple leaves turn a brilliant red in late fall and can be seen to good advantage from McKittrick Canyon and vicinity.  Higher up in the mountains significant remnant forests of ponderosa, pinon and spruce exist, most notably in the area known as "the bowl".  Top predators of the park ecosystem are mountain lion and black bear, but neither are frequently seen.  Encounters with coyotes, gray fox, raccoon, and ringtail cat (one of the characteristic species of the park) are more common.  Mule deer and elk are the largest herbivores and mostly stay in the mountains, but javelinas are more typical of the desert floor.  While bat populations are not as concentrated or as famous as in the "Bat Cave" section of nearby Carlsbad Caverns, there are still 15 or so species of bats that take refuge in the smaller caves of the park.  Over 300 bird species are known from the Guadalupes, although many of them are rare visitors.  Large birds include golden eagle, various species of hawk, turkey vulture and sandhill crane.  Many species of finch and warbler are present.  There are few waterfowl except for accidental visitors during migration season.  The largest venomous snake of the park is the western diamondback rattlesnake, but other rattlesnake species are also present.  (Not to worry; your chances of a rattler encounter arent high, although some caution is indicated when out on the trails around sunrise or sunset.)  The park is also home to three different species of the unusual horned lizard.</field>

It is an area that has seen the transformation from farmland and water-powered mills to a unique suburban neighborhood. It was well known for both gunpowder and textile manufacturing, producing powder for the War of 1812 and the cloth for the Union army during the Civil War. Havertown is the home to several historical sites and is well known for being the birthplace of Swell Bubble Gum, whose factory still stands but closed down in 2004 (is currently being demolished). It is also known for its large Irish-American population, which is still evident today in the many Irish bars and stores throughout the town.</field>

		<field name="content">Hollands growth as a commuter city took place in the mid-1980s, just after the town lost its passenger trains. Regularly scheduled train service lasted until January 14, 1983 via SEPTAs Fox Chase Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, were closed due to failing diesel train equipment that the SEPTA could not afford to fix. As a result, passenger numbers were low and the service cancelled on a temporary basis. As such, Holland Station still appears in SEPTAs publicly posted tariffs. Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, the number of riders remained low. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a good replacement for a rail service, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.</field>

		<field name="content">The name Honolulu means "sheltered bay" or "peace of shelter" in Hawaiian, and its natural harbor catapulted this humble village to importance when King Kamehameha I moved his royal court from the island of Hawaii to Oahu in 1809, shortly after conquering Oahu to unite the Hawaiian Islands. Eventually, in 1845, Kamehameha III officially moved the kingdoms capital from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu.  Honolulus ideally located port made the city a perfect stop for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia, and through the 1800s, descendants of missionaries who arrived in the early 1800s established their headquarters in Honolulu, making it the center of business and the main seaport for the Hawaiian Islands.  The late 1800s and early 1900s brought the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and subsequent annexation by the United States. Under American rule, Honolulu saw the rise of tourism and the first hotels were constructed in Waikiki. The U.S. military also built numerous bases in the islands, including nearby Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor later became known for the surprise attack by the Japanese in 1941, which brought the U.S. into World War II in the Pacific.  Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the states major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the center of the islands tourism industry.</field>

Water temperature averages 82°F (27°C) in the summer months and 77°F (25°C) in the winter months.  The only noticeable variation in seasons is in terms of rainfall. Honolulu is on the sunny, leeward side of the island, and where you are in the city will affect the chances for rain - areas like Waikiki, downtown, and the western side of the city will usually be sunny, while the hills or eastern side of the city may get some passing clouds and very brief rainfall. On average, Honolulu gets less than half an inch of rain in the summer months to almost three inches in the winter months.</field>

		<field name="content">Mankind nearly obliterated this natural treasure.  Upon coming to the area in the mid 1800s, white settlers commenced to alter the marsh, and in the 1900s, the marsh was even drained.  The fact that the marsh exists today is a testament to the hard efforts of forward-thinking individuals and the adaptability of Mother Nature.  Through the efforts of concerned citizens, conservationists and sportsmen in the 1930s, the water levels of the marsh were restored and the marsh was slowly reborn.  The old roots and seeds of the marsh plants that were dormant for decades suddenly came back to life.  Flocks of birds, including some species which hadnt been seen on the marsh for decades, returned each year in greater numbers.  The marsh you see today is a result of 70 years of careful management.  When you look out over the vast marsh, you arent just seeing the wonders of nature--youre witnessing an ongoing success story.</field>

		<field name="content">Joseph and Monee Bailly, the fur traders, settled on the banks of the Little Calumet River in 1822.  The wetlands of the Indiana Dunes proved to be a good place for contacts between the Bailly family and the Pottawatomie tribe of Native Americans.  In 1822, the Pottawatomie nation had already developed an established lifetyle of duneland use, including the trapping of local beaver, raccoon, and muskrat.  After the Pottawatomie people were forcibly expelled from the Lake Michigan shoreline in the 1830s and 1840s, railroads built lines through the Indiana Dunes westward to the fast-growing city of Chicago; but the Dunes themselves, with their comparatively infertile soil, were settled relatively slowly.</field>

		<field name="content">After the newly formed U.S. Steel Corporation began to construct a massive mill complex within the dunes at Gary, Indiana, lovers of the Dunes began efforts to preserve them.  The National Park Service offered in 1916 to protect much of the remaining duneland as Sand Dunes National Park, but many locals opposed the proposal.  In the 1920s, the state of Indiana preserved 2,182 acres of central duneland as Indiana Dunes State Park.  Other sections of duneland were developed as the small communities of Ogden Dunes, Dune Acres, and Beverly Shores.  World War II and the early Cold War years increased pressure upon the United States to increase its production of steel.  For reasons of economical coal and iron ore supply, one of the most efficient geographic locations to make steel within the United States is on the southern border of Lake Michigan.  During the 1950s and early 1960s, several additional steel mills were sited within the dunelands in areas that could otherwise have been preserved for parkland.  After the former Bethlehem Steel Corporation acquired and built its Burns Harbor mill in 1962-64, a public outcry and pressure from activists, led by Sen. Paul H. Douglas (D-Ill.) led to the creation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.</field>

		<field name="content">The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was created by Congress in 1966.  It initially owned no land of its own, and land acquisition opportunities were limited because of previous development.  Many local residents were understandably opposed to federal condemnation.  By the 1980s, much of the 15,000 acres of land making up the current IDNL (as of 2006) had been acquired.  The federal government officially included the Indiana Dunes State Park within the boundaries of the national lakeshore, but has allowed the state to continue to maintain and charge a separate admission fee to the state park.  By 2006, the Lakeshore had come to include eight separate parcels of Lake Michigan beachfront land, as well as numerous parcels of property inland from the lake.  Because the national park was founded after much of the drier land had already been developed, many of the inland parcels that make up the current Lakeshore are riverbottoms or sandy wetlands.</field>

During the warming process that ended the last Ice Age, the lake at several periods rose to levels much higher than the current lake level and laid down sandy shorelines and beaches at points that are now inland from the current coastline.  Todays lake waves and currents continue to bring more sand ashore from beds underneath the surface of the current lake.  This sand, further sculpted by wind and foot erosion, has become todays Indiana Dunes.</field>

		<field name="content">Many ecosystem types can be readily recognized by amateurs.  Ecosystem types, and characteristic grasses and flowering plants, that exist within the Indiana Dunes include the following:  Sand dunes - marram grass, prickly pear, puccoon Wetlands (bogs, marshlands, and swamps) - marsh marigold, skunk cabbage Ponds - bladderwort, gentian Prairies - black-eyed susan, butterfly weed, goldenrod, lupine, prairie grass Savannas - asters, prairie grass Dry woods - columbines, hepatica, Solomons seal Wet woods - Dutchmens breeches, hepatica, trillium, violet  The most common large tree in the Indiana Dunes is the black oak.  There are also plenty of cottonwoods.  Jack pines often grow in burned-over or disturbed areas, and there are several groves of sugar maples (the Bailly/Chellberg farm operates an maple-syrup boil in early spring).  A grove of paper birches on the Cowles Bog Trail is said to be the farthest-south naturally reproducing population of this species in the Great Lakes area.  As of January 2006, whitetail deer lived in quantity in the Indiana Dunes.  The common North American wetland and woodland rodents, such as beavers, muskrats, and squirrels, can be easily seen.</field>

		<field name="content">Old School House  Over four millennia ago, Native Americans began visiting Isle Royale to dig for copper, to tap maple trees for sugar, and to fish.  Since Europeans came to the area, its been host to whitefish fisheries, a series of unprofitable copper mining efforts, and a resort community around 1900.  In the 1920s, Detroit News journalist Albert Stoll Jr. visited Isle Royale, saw what commercial exploitation was beginning to do to undermine the wilderness, and campaigned for its protection; a plaque in his honor was later placed near the tip of Scoville Point.  Isle Royale National Park was established by Congress in 1931, and the last of the land de-privatized in 1940 (with a few of the land owners given lifetime leases).  The archipelago was designated a Wilderness Area in 1976, and named an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.</field>

		<field name="name">landscape</field>
		<field name="content">Isle Royale   The archipelago (consisting of Isle Royale itself and dozens of smaller islands) is the edge of a geologic fault which pushed up from the lake floor and was scoured by ice-age glaciers into a long, ridged island, with lakes and inlets of Lake Superior filling in low points between some of the ridges.  The south sides of these ridges and the south lakeshore tend to be more gently sloped; the north sides and lakeshore more steep.  Crossing from one side of the island to the other isnt usually a great distance, but because of the ridges can involve a lot of climbing and descending.  The island and its ridges run roughly WSW-to-ENE end to end, but for informal navigational purposes theyre usually described as if they ran directly west-to-east (a notion reinforced by the orientation of the park services official map).  When using a compass, keep in mind the islands true orientation.  The Greenstone Ridge runs the length of the island, with a trail along most of its crest.  Isle Royale itself is 45 miles (74 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) at its widest, with an area of about 205 mi² (530 km²).  The highest point on the island is Mount Desor at 1394 feet (425 m) above sea level ndash; about 800 feet (245 m) above lake level ndash; with several other spots along the Greenstone above 1200 feet (365 m) in elevation.</field>

		<field name="content">The island is mostly forested in a mixture of boreal and northern hardwood ecosystems, with a selection of conifer (spruce, fir, pine) and deciduous (birch, aspen, maple, ash) trees.  Past human habitation has left some apple trees behind.  Marsh vegetation is more common in the west, but found in low spots everywhere.  A wide variety of orchids and wildflowers can be found throughout the island.  Berries grow wild; blueberries can be found on open ridge tops, and thimbleberries (with maple-like leaves bigger than your hand; white flowers in early summer, red berries in late summer) grow seemingly everywhere.   a moose grazing in Washington Creek   The island is far enough from the mainland and small enough in area to limit the variety of animals on it; there are no bears, deer, raccoons, nor cats of any kind.  Around 1900, moose introduced themselves to the island, presumably swimming from Ontario.  Wolves followed later, crossing increasingly rare safe ice bridges in 1948 and 1967.  As a closed environment, the island serves as a prime field study of the relationship between prey and predator.  Because the wolf population is descended from two small packs, the island also demonstrates the effects of inbreeding on their viability.  Both populations have gone through booms and busts due to weather, disease, food availability, and predation (the past several summers heat has brought the February 2007 moose population way down to 385, with 21 wolves trying to subsist on the survivors), but they still endure.  Other common mammals are red foxes (filling the scavenger niche, especially around camp sites), beavers (in inland lakes and ponds), red squirrels (everywhere), snowshoe hares, and otters.  Loons, eagles, and ospreys nest on the island, and a large variety of songbirds, woodpeckers, and aquatic birds (especially gulls and ducks) will be seen.  Painted turtles, garter snakes, and a few varieties of amphibians are common.  Northern pike are plentiful in most of the inland lakes, along with varieties of trout, perch, walleye, and other sport fish.  Mosquitoes, no-see-ums, and a few varieties of biting flies are unfortunately abundant, though the extent of these nuisances varies year to year, by season, and from one locale to another.  Insect repellent is essential, and a face net will provide welcome relief when the bugs seem intent on driving you crazy even when your bug dope prevents them from landing.  There are bees on the island as well.</field>

		<field name="content">At a latitude of 48deg;North, and with the moderating influence of cold Lake Superior, Isle Royale rarely gets hot by human standards.  During the summer months youll reach shorts-and-t-shirt weather in the afternoon, especially hiking up on the ridges, but youll also experience some rather chilly nights, sometimes even below 50deg;F (10deg;C) in the "heat" of August.  In May and October, temperatures can easily dip below freezing by night and stay below 60deg;F (15deg;C) all day.  Rainfall fluctuates from month to month, but July and August have the least overcast days (making them the busiest weeks of the summer).  Regardless, a stay of several days any time of the summer without at least some rain is uncommon; either bring rain gear or plan on spending time stuck in your tent or a shelter.  The good news for people with hayfever is that theyll find few common pollen allergens in the air.  (During its resort days, the island was a popular haven for allergy sufferers.)  In the winter, conditions are inhospitable and the island is closed to all but wildlife researchers.  Even the park headquarters relocate to Houghton for the winter.</field>

The profile of the Joshua Tree National Park (then a National Monument) was raised significantly in 1987 with the release of the best-selling U2 album The Joshua Tree, the cover of which featured evocative black-and-white photography of the Parks landscape and distinctive trees.</field>

The higher, moister, and slightly cooler Mojave Desert is the special habitat of the Joshua tree. In addition to Joshua tree forests, the western part of the park also includes some of the most interesting geologic displays found in California’s deserts. Five fan palm oases also dot the park, indicating those few areas where water occurs naturally and wildlife abounds.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown Kansas City is generally defined as the areas including the River Market, the central business district (the "Loop"), the Crossroads Arts District, Crown Center and Union Station.   After years of neglect and decay in the 1980s and 1990s, downtown is making a comeback. Many once-abandoned buildings in downtown have been (or are being) rebuilt into high-dollar condominiums and loft apartments. The demand for residences downtown is quite high. In October of 2007, the Sprint Center sports arena was completed, bringing a modern sports and entertainment venue to the downtown core. The Power and Light District was constructed and opened in 2008. The "PL" District comprises 5 high rise residential and office towers, with many clubs, bars, restaurants, and shops on the lower floors. A new performing arts center south of the convention center area opened in 2011.   The "Downtown Council"    operates security and cleaning/maintenance crews, who keep downtowns streets clean and serve as a security presence. Downtown is one of the safest areas of the city, both day and night.   Traveling north to south, the River Market is the first neighborhood one encounters, south of the banks of the Missouri River. A burgeoning urban neighborhood, it houses many shops, restaurants, bars, and a very active farmers market that convenes every Saturday, even in winter.   The expressways form a loop around the central business district (CBD). Crossing the north segment of the loop takes you from the River Market to the CBD. This is where Kansas Citys famed skyline reaches its greatest heights, further accentuated by its position on top of a sizable hill. The CBD has the principal concentration of white-collar employment in the metro area. The world headquarters for HR Block is located here, within the P and L District.   From here, crossing the south segment of the loop will bring a visitor into the Crossroads Arts District, which is a regional center for art, culture, and nightlife.    When crossing Pershing, Union Station and Crown Center are seen, which houses shops, restaurants, and offices, including the world headquarters of Hallmark. The nearby Liberty Memorial    is the worlds first World War I memorial and has spectacular views from the top. Just south of Crown Center is Union Hill, another revitalized area offering some of the best skyline views in the city.</field>

Summers in Katmai are cool with frequent high winds and rain. Please note that following heavy rainstorms, most rivers in Katmai rise quickly and become extremely hazardous to cross.  Insects can be intense and headnets are recommended.  Winter in Katmai means cold, quiet, and beauty.  Temperatures can range from -40F to 40F with snow or rain possible throughout the season.

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In describing the settlement of Keene, historian H.P. Smith writes “Pioneers penetrated its primitive forests and scaled the natural barriers formed by its precipices as early as 1797.” Most came by way of a rough, almost impassable road linking Keene with Jay and Lewis. Benjamin Payne was the first of those pioneers to put down roots in Keene. He emigrated from Keene, NH, by way of a marked tree trail from Westport. In 1860, the Beede Boarding House opened for business and welcomed T.S. Perkins, the first of many artists to arrive at this North Country wilderness and the beginning of a wave of summer visitors. During the latter half of the 19th century, Keene Flats became known as the “Yosemite of the East”. In 1872 more than 500 guests vacationed here.  The first Adirondack Bicycle Club was formed here in 1897. It developed a riding trail between Keene Valley and St. Huberts. When it folded in 1920, the bike path became a hiking trail. In 1883 Keene Flats became Keene Valley with its own post office. Hiking, health, capturing nature on canvas and waxing philosophical in the mountain air turned Keene and Keene Valley into a summer resort.   The Adirondack Mountain Reserve was incorporated in 1892 and the road to the lower Ausable Lake was built. Guides and caretakers led visitors hiking, hunting and fishing. The tourism industry was established. At the end of the century the town was filled with guest houses, general stores, vegetable gardens, meat markets and all of the commercial facilities needed to run a tourist community. Dentists, taxidermists, car dealerships and insurance agents opened their doors as the 20th century began. Schools moved toward centralization, churches were built and sidewalks laid.    The economic backbone of the town remained the influx of summer people. They stayed at the Ausable Club, at Putnam Camp, on East Hill at Glenmore and Summerhill.   As of 2013, the town has an official  town website  and a more detailed site about  life in the town  maintained by two residents.</field>

		<field name="content">Kenai Fjords National Park is a geological wonderland where glaciers and ice caps meet the ocean. Comprising an edge of the Kenai Peninsula in south central Alaska near the town of Seward, the park is home to the Harding Icefield, one of the four major ice caps in the United States. The Icefield, which covers more than half of the 700,000+ acre national park, has carved long, steep-sided water valleys, called "fjords," forming the perfect habitat and aquatic environment for a wide array of marine wildlife. These plankton-rich waters are natural feeding grounds for whales on their long migrations north and south. Above sea level, the chiseled fjords reach toward the sky, home to millions of migratory birds.  Although the Harding Icefield and other topographic relics found in the park date back to the last ice age, the Kenai Fjords area is one of constant change and activity. The rugged coastline is constantly changed by the collision of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. These forces deepen the fjords, lower the Kenai Mountain Range, and create spectacular landscapes.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In Pre-Columbian times Key West was inhabited by the Tequesta and Calusa peoples. The first European to visit was Juan Ponce de León in 1521. As Florida became a Spanish colony, a fishing and salvage village with a small garrison was established here.  The island was used by fishermen from Cuba and from the British Bahamas, who were later joined by others from the United States after the latter nations independence. While claimed by Spain, no nation exercised de facto control over the community there for some time. The island was considered the "Gibraltar of the West" because of its strategic location on the 90-mile (140 km)–wide deep shipping lane, the Straits of Florida, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. On March 25, 1822, Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, physically claiming the Keys as United States property.   Key West was relatively isolated until 1912, when it was connected to the Florida mainland via the Overseas Railway extension of Henry M. Flaglers Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the railroad and killed hundreds of residents. The FEC could not afford to restore the railroad. The U.S. government then rebuilt the rail route as an automobile highway, completed in 1938, which became an extension of United States Highway 1. The portion of U.S. 1 through the Keys is called the Overseas Highway.</field>

		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">Key West claims to be the only city in the lower 48 states never to have had a frost. Because of the proximity of the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida, about 12 miles (19 km) south and southeast, and the tempering effects of the Gulf of Mexico to the west and north, Key West has a notably mild, tropical climate.  Precipitation is characterized by dry and wet seasons. The period of November through April receives abundant sunshine and slightly less than 25 percent of the annual rainfall. This rainfall usually occurs in advance of cold fronts in a few heavy or light showers. May through October is normally the wet season, receiving approximately 53 percent of the yearly total in numerous showers and thunderstorms. Rain falls on most days of the wet season. Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon. Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent hurricanes may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts. At any rate, Key West is the driest city in Florida.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Lakeland was first settled in the 1870s and began to develop as the rail lines reached the area in 1884. It was incorporated 1 January 1885. The town was founded by Abraham Munn (a resident of Louisville, Kentucky), who purchased 80 acres (320,000 m2) of land in what is now downtown Lakeland in 1882 and platted the land for the town in 1884. Among the names considered (and rejected) for the town by its residents were Munnville, Red Bug and Rome City.  In April 1898, the Spanish-American War began and started a crucial point in Lakelands development. While the war ended quickly and had little impact on most of the nation, the Florida peninsula was used as a launch point for the war and the then small town of Lakeland would house over 9,000 troops.  The Florida boom resulted in the construction of many significant structures in Lakeland, a number of which are today listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This list includes the Terrace Hotel, New Florida Hotel (Regency Tower, currently Lake Mirror Tower), Polk Theatre, Promenade of Lake Mirror, Polk Museum of Art (not a product of the 20s boom), Park Trammell Building (formerly the Lakeland Public Library and today the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce), and others. The city also has several historic districts with many large buildings built during the 1920s and 1940s. The Cleveland Indians held spring training there from 1923 to 1927 at Henley Field Ball Park. Parks were developed surrounding Lake Mirror including Barnett Childrens Park, Hollis Gardens, and the newest, Allen Kryger Park.  The "boom" period went "bust" quickly, and years passed before the city recovered. Part of the re-emergence was due to the arrival of the Detroit Tigers in 1934 for spring training. (The team continues to train at Lakelands Joker Marchant Stadium and owns the citys Florida State League team, the Lakeland Flying Tigers.) The development of the Lakeland Municipal Airport as a major facility in central Florida transportation was another factor. The 1930s also featured the arrival of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he came to Lakeland at the request of Florida Southern College President Ludd Spivey to design a "great education temple in Florida." For 20 years Wright worked on his "true American campus" creation. In his original master plan he called for 18 buildings (and several other structures), nine of which were completed and nine left on the drawing board. All of the buildings were built out of what Wright called his "textile block system," the first use of such a system in Florida. He called his project "A Child of the Sun," so named from the architect’s own description of being "out of the ground, into the light, a child of the sun." It is the largest one-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings in the world, and in many ways helped to form a pattern for many colleges in Florida and other areas of the country in the future years.</field>

		<field name="content">Lakeland—like all of Central Florida—has a humid, subtropical climate. Summers are generally hot and humid, with highs above 90°F from May-September although, oddly enough, the temperature seldom surpasses about 96°F (which results in a month like July, where the average high is 95°F and the all-time record for the month is just 5° higher at 100°F). Early morning lows are usually in the mid-70s °F (around 23°C) but the humidity is usually around 90-100% at sunrise, so mornings can be steamy. Beginning in early or mid-June, the rainy season lasts until mid to late September, during which time thunderstorms (sometimes severe) are a regular afternoon event. June, July, August average over 7nbsp;in (178nbsp;mm) of rain per month, with September falling to a respectable 6.33nbsp;in (161nbsp;mm) of rain. Winters are mild with average highs in the 70s °F (around 22-25°C) and lows in the 50s °F (around 11-15°C). Highs may occasionally surpass 80°F (27°C), while lows in the 40s (5-10°C) arent uncommon. Winter weather is punctuated by occasional cold fronts, which can knock highs into the 60s °F (16-20°C) or even 50s °F (11-15°C) and night-time lows into the 40s °F (5-10°C) and 30s °F (0-4°C). Lows below freezing (32°F, 0°C) occur, on average, just 2 times a year (very rarely below 28°F/-2°C). Spring and fall are transitional seasons between summer/winter temperatures. February-May are the driest months of the year, averaging 2-3nbsp;in (50-80nbsp;mm) of rain, but in drier years these months may see less than 0.5nbsp;in (13nbsp;mm) of rain.   Lakeland can be impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes during Hurricane Season (1 Jun-30 Nov). Tropical storms in Central Florida can bring heavy rains (several inches in a 24 hour or less time span) and potentially a squall line. As with any storm, there is danger involved with minor flooding, lightning, tornadoes, and trees falling down, but for most people tropical storms are just a nuisance for a day or two. The effects of hurricanes varies with each storm, depending on location, size, strength, and other factors. Hurricanes Dennis Ivan, which passed well off the west coast, brought squall lines in outer bands that swept over the region, bringing strong winds (50-80nbsp;mph or 80-130nbsp;km/h) and isolated tornadoes. In 2004, Hurricanes Charley (Category 2), Frances (actually a strong Tropical Storm when it reached Lakeland), and Jeanne (Category 1) all passed through Polk County, within 25nbsp;mi of Lakeland, bringing moderate destruction. However, these were the first hurricanes since Hurricane Donna in 1960 to pass through Polk County, so fortunately they are not a common occurrence.</field>

		<field name="content">Lake Wales climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the lines of storms (each called a "seabreeze") sometimes collide, resulting in strong thunderstorms with frequent lightning and tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+nbsp;mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.  Winters are mild, with highs in the 70snbsp;(°F; 21-27°C) and lows in the 50snbsp;(°F; 10-15°C). Lows in the 30snbsp;(°F; 0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F/−1°C at 6AM, 55°F/13°C by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is extremely rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010.   Spring and fall are transition periods, with spring tending to be the driest months of the year.  In 2004, Lake Wales was hit by three hurricanes: Charley, Frances, Jeanne. It was the first time in recorded U.S. history that 3 hurricanes passed through the same county (Polk County) in the same year, with Lake Wales and other southern Polk County towns lying closest to the path of these hurricanes eyes.</field>

		<field name="content">The history of the recreation area is tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority.  Established in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the TVA was tasked with bringing flood control, power generation, and river navigation to the waterways of the Tennessee River valley.  After the Great Flood of 1937, the TVA began land acquisition in order to build a dam on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, KY.  The dam was completed in 1945 and the resulting impoundment of water was named Kentucky Lake.  Shortly after, the US Corps of Engineers began constructing a dam on the nearby Cumberland River with the aim of connecting the navigable waters of the Cumberland with the Tennessee.  To accomplish this, a canal was constructed between the two rivers.  The dam was completed in 1966 and the resulting lake was named Lake Barkley after Alben Barkley, a Kentucky native and Vice President of the United States under President Harry S. Truman.  By 1963, all of the land between the two lakes had been acquired by the federal government and President John F. Kennedy signed legislation creating the recreation area and giving control of the land to the TVA.  In 1998, the administration of Land Between the Lakes National Recreation area was transferred to the US Forest Service.</field>

		<field name="content">Beneath Lassen Volcanics peaceful forests and gem-like lakes lies evidence of a turbulent and fiery past. 600,000 years ago, the collision and warping of continental plates led to violent eruptions and the formation of lofty Mt. Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano.) After 200,000 years of volcanic activity, vents and smaller volcanoes on Tehamas flanks-including Lassen Peak-drew magma away from the main cone. Hydrothermal areas ate away at the great mountains bulk. Beneath the onslaught of Ice Age glaciers, Mt. Tehama crumbled and finally ceased to exist. But the volcanic landscape lived on: in 1914, Lassen Peak awoke. The Peak had its most significant activity in 1915 and minor activity through 1921.  All four types of volcanoes in the world are found in the park. Over 150 miles of trails and a culturally significant scenic highway provide access to volcanic wonders including steam vents, mudpots, boiling pools, volcanic peaks, and painted dunes.</field>

Over 700 flowering plant species grace the park, providing shelter and food for 250 vertebrates as well as a host of invertebrates including insects.  This great diversity of life forms is due to two factors: the geographic location of the park and the abundance of habitats that occur there.  Situated at the southern end of the Cascade Range geologic province, Lassen Volcanic National Park lies at the crossroads of three great biological provinces: the Cascades range to the north, the Sierra Nevada mountains to the south and the Great Basin desert to the east.  The myriad habitats of Lassen Volcanic National Park are produced by variations in environmental conditions such as elevation (5,000 to 10,457 feet), moisture (precipitation is greater on the western than the eastern side of the park), substrate (rock type and soil depth), temperature, insolation (amount of sun) and prior disturbance (both natural and human-caused).</field>

In the middle of the 19th century, when the Erie Railroad needed to bridge the gorge, they built the worlds tallest wooden bridge right above the Upper Falls.  The view from up there was so spectacular that trains would stop and let passengers off just to take in the sight.  On one such voyage was  Buffalo  industrialist William Pryor Letchworth; he so enjoyed the view that he bought over a thousand acres of gorge land and built himself a summer home.  He called the estate Glen Iris after the rainbow that often formed in the mist of the Middle Falls.  As his death approached, the elderly Letchworth decided to protect the gorge from hydro-power development by deeding it to the State for use as a park in 1906.</field>

		<field name="content">The Lower Falls   The three cascades are near the south end of the park.  The Upper Falls, which total 71 feet (a 50-foot main drop and a few rapids just below) drop over a tight horseshoe bend, making them a little hard to see, but the Portage Bridge just above the crest makes for a dramatic backdrop.  The Middle Falls are within easy walking distance of the Upper, and they are both the tallest (107 ft) and the most picturesque.  The rainbows of the Middle Falls captured the imagination of both the Seneca Indians (who believed the beauty of the falls made the sun pause at midday) and William Pryor Letchworth, who named his estate Glen Iris after the rainbow-filled valley of the Middle Falls.  The Lower Falls are a bit farther downstream, and they have the shortest drop (70 feet).  Youve got to climb down a substantial set of stairs to get to any decent viewing location, but its worth it, as the Lower Falls face is the most interesting of the three.  Theres a stone footbridge just below the Lower Falls, the only (legal) way to walk across the river within the park.  While the three main waterfalls capture most of the attention—rightfully so—there are a number of other waterfalls in the park, each representing a tributary of the Genesee that now has to drop all the way down into the carved gorge.  That makes for some very tall falls, though they tend to be fairly small in width and volume.  Some even dry up seasonally.  But with total drops approaching 500 feet, the heights some of these falls reach can rival the volume of the Genesee Falls for sheer spectacle.</field>

		<field name="content">Despite its nickname, the valley carved by the Genesee River doesnt really look like the Grand Canyon; visitors whove seen the real thing wont be very impressed by the comparison.  For starters, its much smaller in scale.  At its widest point, the Grand Canyon is 18 miles (29 km) wide; Letchworth Park would just fit inside theremdash;lengthwise!  And the Grand Canyons mile-high depth dwarfs the 300-foot walls of the Letchworth gorge.  On the other hand, Letchworth has far more vegetation in and around the gorge, and its fair to say there are few other gorges this side of the Mississippi that approach Letchworth in either size or beauty.  Geologically, the Letchworth gorge is very young, carved when the Genesee was forced to find a new route northward after the last ice age.  The preglacial river that flowed through current-day  Portageville  was a tributary of the preglacial Genesee River, and it took a more easterly course through  Nunda .  It then joined the main branch of the preglacial Genesee, which flowed northwest to  Mount Morris , then north to  Rochester .  When the two branches of the river were blocked by glacial debris at  Dansville  and Nunda, the east branch rerouted to the south, becoming part of the Susequehanna watershed, while the west branch was forced into a more direct route between Portageville and Mount Morris.  The new route led the river over the Allegheny Plateau, dropping into the preglacial river valley at Mount Morris.  Over the next ten millennia, the cascade carved its way backward, much as the Niagara River did during the same period, eventually forming a series of three waterfalls just north of modern Portageville... and a spectacular gorge in its wake.  The course the gorge takes is a bit unusual; it twists and turns rather than taking a straight path; since the river once flowed in a meandering route over a broad plain, the falls cut their way backward along the course that it initially took.  The three cascades of the upper Genesee should not be confused with three similar waterfalls farther downstream (to the north) in Rochester.  Both locations have a Lower, Middle, and Upper (or High) Falls, and both sets were formed during the same period, but they are more than fifty miles apart.</field>

The "little rock" was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The original historic "little rock" was later dynamited and used as a foundation for a railroad bridge, but its location can be visited in downtowns Riverfront Park.  Little Rock is located at the first high that upstream travelers on the Arkansas River came to, and so was a logical place to found a settlement. When it became apparent that the original capital of Arkansas Territory, Arkansas Post, was too subject to flooding, the seat of government was moved to Little Rock in 1819.</field>

Winters are very cold, with daytime temperatures rarely getting above freezing and overnight lows frequently dropping below 0F (-18C). Snow is less frequent than in  Salt Lake City  but the individual storms are usually larger. Cache Valley also has one of the worst inversions in the state, in which cold, moist air and pollutants can become trapped in the valley. A simple five minute ride up any of the cayons will get you out of the inversion and into some of the most beautiful winter mountain landscapes in all of Utah.  Spring and Fall are wild and feature frequent temperature changes with possibilities of snow as early as October and as late as May. Summer is cooler than in Salt Lake City but still hot, with daytime temperatures generally ranging from 75F (24C) to 95F (35C) - they rarely reach above 100F (38C). It is, however, far enough north that it avoids most of the summer thunderstorms. Although the city is cozy and the surrounding terrain is spectacular, the unpredictable weather is a turnoff for some. Others find the changing weather enjoyable and enjoy spend time outdoors taking in the many recreactional oppertunities throughout the valley and its many canyons.</field>

Between the months of June - September average daytime highs are 82°F (28°C), and nighttime lows average 63°F (17°C). Winters are mild and bring much of the annual rainfall. Between the months of December - March average daytime highs are 68°F (20°C), and nighttime lows are 49°F (9°C). The season of spring is comprised of a mixture of gloomy rainy days and warm sunny days; and fall has the same mixture, typically with more sunny days, however.  Temperatures can also fluctuate wildly depending where you are in the city. For example, it can be 84°F (29°C) in Venice and 93°F (34°C) in Pacoima on the same day in mid-July. The coast tends to stay a bit cooler which helps during summer days, but as such, is chillier at night even in the summer. Bring a sweater and pants if you stay for dinner near the coast.</field>

		<field name="content">Lubbock County was founded in 1876 and named after Thomas S. Lubbock, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and subsequent Confederate officer.  Mr. Lubbock didnt have any particular ties to the area; but the area bore his name because a state administrator penciled in names of counties on a crude map of the Panhandle - at random. The modern town of Lubbock was not established until 1890 when old-Lubbock and the smaller town of Monterey struck an unusual alliance and merged the two communities, a deal most likely initiated by rival town promoters hired by area ranchers and merchants to lobby Ft. Worth Denver for a rail depot. The site of Monterey was chosen in lieu of the new townships name, Lubbock. Old-Lubbocks residents relocated to Monterey just south of the the Yellowhouse Canyon, dragging the Nicollete Hotel with them on rollers. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891 and incorporated as a city in 1909.  In 1923 Texas Technological College was founded after a contentious bid war among several area cities including  Amarillo  and Plainview. The city of Lubbock was a mile away from the only campus building during its first session.   A category F-5 tornado cut a 8-mile (13 km) gash through the city on the evening of May 11, 1970, resulting in $125 million in property damage and the loss of 26 lives. The devastation received international news coverage and was among the first natural disaster recoveries to be documented on television. The coordinated effort served as a model for disaster recovery research and planning. The destruction of several thousand homes effectively ended segregation throughout the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Lynchburgs nickname, the "City of Seven Hills," is very descriptive of the geography of the city. Though it refers most directly to the hills near where the city was founded, these hills extend far beyond the riverfront at the James River. The area includes much of Candlers Mountain.  Spring in Lynchburg is short-lived, often it is simply a period of wide fluctuation between mid-late winter and early-mid summer temperatures. Summers are humid and hot with temperatures generally reaching 90°F. Autumns are mild; temperatures stay somewhere between 40°F and 55°F. Once winter hits, temperatures will top out near freezing until February and, perhaps, beyond. Recently, winters have brought lots of snow to the Lynchburg area, bringing about three one-foot snowstorms each winter.  Generally, storms will pass through over the course of a few hours, but rain systems without lightning and thunder will stick in Lynchburg for days at a time, lending to the nickname "Drenchburg." When there is wind in Lynchburg, it tends to be a very high wind. Unlike nearby areas, the warmest part of the day in this part of Virginia is generally 5PM.</field>

		<field name="content">President Johnsons family owned the ranch and the "Texas White House" since at least the turn of the 20th Century.  LBJs aunt and uncle owned the main house on the ranch during the Presidents childhood.  In fact, Johnson purchased the ranch from his aunt in the 1940s while a United States Senator representing Texas and continued accumulating land along the Pedernales River throughout the remainder of his life.  President Johnson was born in a smaller house down the riverbank from his aunts home.  The home, constructed in the "dogtrot" or "breezeway" style, is so named because a "dogtrot" or "breezeway" open porch runs through the middle of the home for maximum ventilation during the hot Texas summers.  Reconstructed during his first presidential term using historically accurate building techniques, the house served as a guest house for dignitaries and/or staffers visiting LBJs Texas ranch.  (The original home fell into disrepair and met with demolition in the 1930s.)  Interestingly, however, LBJ landscaped the property in a style attractive by 1960s-1970s standards: expansive green lawns of St. Augustine grass, squat green shrubs, and huge oak and pecan trees.  The landscaping, which the  National Park Service  ("NPS") maintains to look as it did when LBJ reconstructed the birthplace home, differs from the landscaping used when LBJs parents owned the home.  During the early 20th century, when Sam Ealy and Rebekah Baines Johnson, LBJs parents, owned the home, many rural Texans and southerners favored a "swept" yard of packed dirt and without grass.  Finally, in 1912, when LBJ was four years old, the Johnsons left what became part of the ranch along the Pedernales and moved into Johnson Citys limits.  A white frame house with large porches sits a few blocks off U.S. Highway 290 surrounded by a white picket fence.  LBJ spent most of his formative years in the Johnson City home before graduating from high school and attending Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now  Texas State University-San Marcos ) in San Marcos, Texas.  Later, Johnson launched his congressional bid from his parents front porch in Johnson City.  President and Mrs. Johnson gave the ranch and the boyhood home to the American people in 1972, reserving a life estate for themselves.  After President Johnsons 1973 death caused by a heart attack, Mrs. Johnson lived in the "Texas White House" until her final hospitalization in July 2007.  Following Mrs. Johnsons July 2007 death, the Secret Service turned over all portions of the ranch property to the National Park Service.  NPS is currently working with the Johnson family to determine what personal belongings will remain at the residence.  LBJs office should open to the public for tours on August 27, 2008, which would have been his 100th birthday.  Other rooms in the house will open subsequently as NPS readies them for historical interpretation and public use.  Across the river from the ranch, however, is the  Lyndon B. Johnson State Historical Park , administered by the Texas Parks Wildlife Department, an agency of the State of Texas.  State-owned lands, as distinguished from the federally-owned ranch, contain the visitors center from which all ranch tours depart, restroom facilities, picnic areas, and a living history village.  The State of Texas acquired the land in 1967 and opened the park in 1970.</field>

Prairie grasses cover rolling hills dotted with mesquite trees and scrub brush.  Both areas of the park, however, are located nearer the clear, cold Pedernales River.  The Pedernales, part of a spring-fed river system in the Hill Country which also includes the Comal, the Guadalupe, the Colorado, and the Nueces, maintains a steady temperature in the 60-70 degree Fahrenheit range.  Nearer the river, where the main park areas lie, the landscape changes to lush green pastures with towering oak and pecan trees.</field>

		<field name="content">Notably, the rolling pastures of the state-owned park land across the Pedernales from the federally-owned ranch are covered in wildflowers, blooming a brilliant yellow in early summer.  Wildflowers played a large role in the Johnsons life, as Mrs. Johnson badgered the President to push the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 through Congress.  As a result, highway right-of-ways across the nation are better maintained, with some having an almost park-like feel.  Mrs. Johnson herself personally contributed to the beautification effort by planting the first tree funded by the project in Washington, D.C., fighting to preserve a natural environment for  Town Lake , now called  Lady Bird Lake  in  Austin, TX , and founding the  National Wildflower Research Center , also in Austin.  Seldom,however, was Mrs. Johnson seen on the ranch land without a pocket full of wildflower seeds; thus, the fields of wildflowers at the state park entrance serve as a fitting tribute to a Presidents wife.  The park hosts a number of animal species, including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.  There are also many exotic species within the park boundaries that were introduced to this area. The only threatened and endangered species known within the park is the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), which winters in the area. Endemic species found within the boundaries of the park include the Guadalupe Bass (Micropterus treculi) and the Texas Map Turtle (Graptemys versa). The Texas Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma Cornutum) was once common within the park and region and is now listed as a Texas Endangered Species.  LBJ prided himself that the ranch functioned as a working cattle ranch.  After purchasing several head of Texas Longhorn cattle, building the necessary barns and other facilities, and appointing a ranch foreman, insiders knew that LBJ would call the ranch almost daily for weather reports, grazing conditions, and medical updates on his herd.  In order to maintain the cultural landscaping within Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, the National Park Service continues to manage the working ranch established by President Johnson. A very regimented, closely-monitored livestock management and grazing program is followed. There is strict control over livestock numbers at the park - approximately 100-125 head of white-faced, registered Hereford cattle. In the Johnson Settlement, the park maintains a small herd of Longhorn cattle and horses.  Common native mammals that can be found within the park include the Opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Eastern Red Bat (Lasiurus borealis), Nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), Black-tailed Jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), Fox Squirrel (Sciurus niger), Pygmy Mouse (Baiomys taylori), House Mouse (Mus musculus), Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), Ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), Raccoon (Procyon lotor), Skunk (Mephitis or Spilogale), and White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus).  Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, ranchers in the Texas Hill Country diversified their practices in order to generate income. This diversification included raising a variety of exotic species for sale (such as emu) or for species propagation for zoos or other certified repositories. Income is also generated through hunting leases of native white-tailed deer and exotic game animals.  A number of exotic animal species have been historically raised on the LBJ Ranch as exotic game for hunting.  Neighboring ranches also manage populations of exotic game animals. These include Mouflon-Barbados Sheep (Ovis sp.), Aoudad Sheep (Ammotragus Lervia), Nilgai Antelope (Rosetaphus tragocamelus), Blackbuck Antelope (Antilope cervicapra), English Red Deer (Cervus Elaphus), Axis Deer (Axis axis), Fallow Deer (Dama dama) and Sika Deer (Cervus Nippon).  Another exotic species that can be seen along the river is Nutria (Myocastor coypus).  These large rodents burrow into riverbanks, leading to increased erosion during the frequent floods this region experiences  Habitats for amphibians at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park include the Pedernales River, Town Creek, multiple stock tanks, and natural springs and seeps. These areas support multiple varieties of amphibians. There is an abundance of frogs, toads and salamanders that take advantage of these moist habitats.  The park offers a rich variety of avian habitats: mesquite grasslands; live oak, post oak, and cedar woodlands; open water and the margins of the Pedernales River including a narrow pecan gallery woodland. Live oak, post oak, mesquite, juniper, native pecan, sugar hackberry, yaupon, and sumac are abundant. Among the approximately 100 types of grasses that grow here are little bluestem, bushy bluestem, Canada wild rye, switchgrass, and eastern gamma grass. Dove weed (Croton), giant ragweed, and goldenrod are common. Over 25 species of conspicuous wildflowers bloom in profusion during spring and early summer.  Bird inventories within the park reflect the mingling of eastern and western species and races characteristic of the avifauna of the Edwards Plateau. Although some Hill Country specialties are rarely found, eastern and western subspecies commonly overlap. Many of the approximately forty permanent resident species, along with numerous summer residents, nest within the park. Of the permanent residents are the  Eastern Bluebird Blue Jay Northern Mockingbird Mourning Dove Cardinal Northern Bobwhite Eastern Phoebe Bewicks and Carolina Wrens.  Summer visitors nesting in the park include  Summer Tanager Painted Bunting Black-chinned Hummingbird Scissor-tailed Flycatchers and a variety of swallow species  Migrations in the spring are normally light, but among the species of migrating warblers are the Yellow Warbler and Common Yellowthroat. Especially during the winter, the Pedernales River hosts a number of duck species, cormorants, shorebirds, and waders.  Common fish species identified within the park include:  American Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) Central Stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum) Red Shiner (Cyprinella venusta) European Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Mimic Shiner (Notropis volucellus) Bullhead Minnow (Pimephales vigilax) Grey Redhorse (Scartomyzon congestus Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) Brook Silverside (Labidesthes sicculus) Green Silverside (Lempois cyanellus) Warmouth (Lepomis gulosus) Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) Guadalupe Bass (Micropeterus treculii) White Crappie (Pomoxis annularis) Texas Logperch (Percina carbonaria)  Other fish that are common throughout most of Texas and the Hill Country include:  Black Bullhead (Ameiurus melas) Yellow Bullhead (Ameiurus natalis) River Carpsucker (Carpoides carpio) Plains Killfish (Fundulus zebrinus) Longnose Gar (Lepisosteus osseus) Redbreast Sunfish (Lepomis stramineus) Longear Sunfish (L. megalotis) Redear Sunfish (L. microlophus) Sand Shiner (Notropis stramineus)  Headwater spring pools and streams in the Texas Hill Country typically harbor few, if any, mussels, largely because the cool, clear waters lack sufficient phytoplankton and other foods needed to support mussel populations. There are two types of mussels that have been identified at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park - the Yellow Sandshell (Lampsilis teres) and the Southern Mapleleaf (Quadrula apiculata).   A variety of reptile species have been identified within the boundaries of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park.  The five common turtles inventoried include the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina), Texas Map Turtle (Graptemys versa), Red-eared Slider (Trachemys scipta elegans), Texas Cooter (Pseudemys texana), and Guadalupe Spiny Softshell (Apalone spinifera guadalupensis).  Common snakes include the Diamondback Watersnake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), Texas Brown Snake (Storeria dekayi texana), and the Texas Rat Snake (Elaphe obsoleta lindheimerii). The Green Anole (Anolis carolinensis) is a lizard that is usually seen sunning on fence lines throughout the park.  The Mediterranean Gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) is a common exotic found inhabiting many of the structures.</field>

		<field name="content">Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park is made up of two districts (the Johnson City District in Blanco County and the LBJ Ranch District in Gillespie County), each lying in the Pedernales River Valley, which cuts through a geologic region known as the Llano Uplift. The area is characterized by hills covered with juniper and oak, with elevations ranging from 1,000-2,500 feet above sea level. The climate is dry, sub-humid: Blanco County averages 34 inches of rain per year and Gillespie County, 27.44 inches. The summers are generally hot and the winters mild. The average length of the growing season is 234 days in Blanco County and 219 days in Gillespie County. The average annual free water evaporation is 58 inches in Blanco County and 62 inches in Gillespie County.  The regional climate for the Texas Hill Country is classified as subtropical-subhumid. The mean annual temperature in the area is 18.7ºC and the mean annual rainfall is 30.2 cm. Precipitation maxima occur in spring and fall in response to frontal systems entering the region from the north that merge with unstable and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.  The park maintains a weather station in the Johnson City District, where daily weather readings are manually collected. The Texas Forest Service maintains a weather station in the LBJ Ranch District. This collected data is used for fire weather forecasts.</field>

		<field name="content">The state crosses many different geographical zones, from the low, sandy barrier islands of the Atlantic Coast to the fertile, lowlands of the Chesapeake Basin, which rise into the foothills of the Piedmont, and eventually the rugged terrain of the Appalachian Mountains.  Maryland has been called "America in Miniature" because of the great difference of landscape one can experience in such a small area.   The state sport is indeed jousting   The climate of Maryland varies as much as its topography.  The lower elevation Atlantic Coastal Plain, which surrounds the  Chesapeake Bay  and includes the major cities of  Baltimore ,  Annapolis , and  Salisbury  has a mild subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and cold winters with little to moderate snowfall, though winter storms do occasionally bring several inches to a foot or more of snow across Central Maryland.  As one moves away from the Bay and higher in elevation, the climate becomes more continental, with milder summers and colder winters including the major cities of  Hagerstown  and  Cumberland .  In the mountains of the west summers are cool, and winters can be very cold with heavy snows.  The mountains protect the eastern half of Maryland from much of the harsh winter weather experienced in the  Great Lakes  region.</field>

		<field name="content">Massachusetts is one of the oldest states in America, dating back to the foundation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1620. The name Massachusetts comes from Algonquian Indian words that mean the great mountain, an apparent reference to the tallest of the Blue Hills, a recreation area south of the town of Milton.   Massachusetts is a state of firsts - the first public school (Boston Latin School), the first public library (Boston Public Library), the first public park (Worcester), the first American university (Harvard), the first National Armory (Springfield), the first gasoline-powered automobile (Springfield), the first birth control pill (Worcester), the first public beach (Revere Beach), the first motorcycle (Springfield), the first modern fire engine (Springfield), the first liquid fuel rocket (Worcester), the birthplace of basketball (Springfield), and the birthplace of Volleyball (Holyoke). It also features the site of the Boston Massacre, the event that set off the American Revolutionary War, with the "shot heard round the world" in Concord at the Old North Bridge.  Massachusetts also has its dark side, the Salem Witch Trials being one of the most significant black spots on the states history. Though far less frequent than in the past, murders related to organized crime and rampant corruption of public officials were once a fact of life for Bostonians.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The name of the park is Spanish for "green table", referring to the vegetation found at the tops of the plateaus in this area. The Ancestral Puebloans chose Mesa Verde as their settlement 1,400 years ago, establishing small pithouses (large holes in the ground with a wooden roof overhead) on the mesa tops. Back then they were more nomadic, and hunted game with spears and were skilled basketmakers. Over time they began to farm the mesa tops, learned how to create pottery, and fashioned bows and arrows instead of spears.  As the population grew, the Ancestral Puebloans moved from pithouses to pole-and-adobe houses built above ground. The pithouses became kivas (ceremonial rooms) as the mesa top villages became larger and more complex. Stone masonry replaced the poles and mud of earlier houses, as villages rose two or three stories high, became more compact, and had many rooms. During this time, pottery replaced baskets as a more desired craft.  Around the year 1200, the Ancestral Puebloans began to move under overhangs found in the cliffs of the canyons. Here, they built cities with multi-storied structures that housed 100-400 people. However, the Ancestral Puebloans only used these incredible constructions for less than 100 years. By the year 1300, they had left the area for reasons unknown, traveling south into New Mexico and Arizona.</field>

		<field name="content">About 100 million years ago, Mesa Verde and the surrounding area were covered by a shallow sea, and sand deposits cemented into the sandstone layers that make up much of the parks geology. As the sea withdrew to the south, uplift in the area created the high plateau that is Mesa Verde. Over time, small streams have cut channels into the plateau, creating steep canyons which separate the individual mesas. Traveling south, the mesa extends like fingers into the desert.  From the park entrance in Montezuma Valley, the elevation climbs steeply to the rim of the flat mesa top.  Elevations in the park range from about 6,100 feet (1,860 meters) to about 8,400 feet (2,560 meters) above sea level.  After a spring storm, melted snow drips from the cliff tops at Spruce Tree House and refreezes on the trees below. Spruce Tree House is the only cliff dwelling in the park open year round.</field>

You might also see squirrels, skunks, or an occasional black bear around the campground. Other mammals seen in the park include coyote, gray fox, mountain lion, black bear, elk, marmot, and porcupines. There is also a wide variety of birds in the park (Mesa Verde even has a bird checklist). In the canyons you could find warblers, flycatchers, woodpeckers, jays, hawks, chickadees, titmice, and other species. Hawks, golden eagles, and peregrine falcons can be seen on the rim of the mesa along the Montezuma Valley.  Mesa Verde is in the Upper Sonoran Life Zone, which is characterized by semi-arid climate, moderately high altitude, and pinyon-juniper forests. Big sagebrush, Douglas fir, and Ponderosa pine are quite common. Gambel oak is in abundance around the Morefield Campground.  Watch for  poison ivy , particularly around Morefield Campground and in the canyons.  Incidentally, if youve never seen poison ivy in the wild, the parks brochure for the Petroglyph Point trail—see below under "Do"—helpfully points out a place along the trail where it grows perennially, so that you can see what its like.  Look but dont touch!</field>

		<field name="title">Miami Beach/South Beach</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In 1870, South Beach was completely different from what we know and vision South Beach as it is today. In 1870, South Beach was predominantly unsettled farmland. In that year the Lum brothers decided to purchase the 160 acres of land to grow coconuts. From this a daughter of one of the Lum brothers named the land “South Beach” and the name did not stick until later on. The brothers decided in 1894 to leave the land to John Collins and after receiving the property he then discovered fresh water and expanded his parcel further to what is now 67th street.   Later in 1912, two Miami businessmen bought 400 acres of land from Collins to create their vision of turning the land into “single-family” homes. With the idea to build these “modest” single family homes, Collins felt that there would need to be a bridge built from Miami to the island and construction for this bridge took place in 1913 after the support of many local bank investors. Due to the enormous amount of money this bridge was costing as always John Collins ran out of money and a year later the project was taken over by Carl G. Fisher who had a different vision for an independent city from Miami. The bridge was built a year later after a nice price for fifty thousand dollars. The drive and determination that each business men had for Miamis South Beach, it was not incorporated until 1915 and the land boom for the location did not set in until 1920. With automobile accessible roads that includes the famous streets like Collins avenue, 5th street, Washington Avenue and Ocean Drive, these areas were built for the rich and possibly the famous.   During World War II, Miamis South Beach became the location for many soldiers as a training location and after the war many of soldiers wanted to make Miami Beach their permanent place of residency, which help double the population for the area. Forty years later Miami Beach became an area filled with new buildings and had a new reputation as the “Art Deco District” and took on the famous name “South Beach” or nickname “SoBe”. It was not until later on in 1964, that South Beach became more popular from the help of TV personality Jackie Gleason. His comedy hour show that would broadcast once a week would display a sunny and warm endorsement for the beautiful Miami Beach.   Years after many advertisement of this beautiful destination began to gain more popularity; especially with the retirement community. Many retirees planned on relocating from the cold bitter atmosphere and retire to Miamis South Beach for warm and relaxing location and could experience this all year long. Unfortunately some of these retirees did not take into consideration the upkeep that would have to be put into a property that was closer to the beach. After the decline for the senior citizen population in this area, South Beach took a downturn in appearance and was considered rundown for an amount of time, affecting the appearance and the reputation for the city.   However this change of scenery for the town helped when it came to the filming the famous gangster movie “Scarface”. The movie was then released in 1983 and this helped put South Beach on the map and interest began to rise again to its once beautiful location and a playground for the rich and famous. Throughout the rest of the 1980s and 1990s; South Beach infused many more investment opportunities that has helped it transform once again into a destination for business, tourists and others to make South Beach their new home. South Beach is advertised more through television and has adapted to the city for nightlife with many dance clubs, bars, restaurants and shopping. With the help from these investments, South Beach today has a new wonderful, fun and relaxing reputation, which makes it the perfect destination for all ages.</field>

Visit sites like Lincoln Road pedestrian mall, considered South Beachs premier shopping area. It is home to many restaurants and several nightclubs, such as Score and Function, as well as many retail outlets. Ocean Drive is the easternmost street in South Beach, and stems from south of First to 15th Street, running in a north-south direction. Ocean Drive is responsible for the South Beach aesthetic that most out-of-town visitors expect. It is a popular Spring Break and tourist area, including the famous, yet predominantly local, Pearl and Nikki Beach night spots. It is also home to several prominent restaurants (including "News Cafe," "Mangos," and the MTV-popularized "Clevelander") and is the site of Gianni Versaces former ocean front mansion. South Beach has a very active club and bar scene. It is host to over 150 clubs and other destinations, most of which close at 5AM.   Dining opens up a great variety for all taste and culinary preferences. With the most known restaurants of South Florida, South Beach has the best reputation in international cuisine. Classic dinners, cafeterias and fast food restaurants give more option to a day by day casual meal. South Beach is also home to all kind of variety of cultural, art and exhibition events. Miami Beach Convention Center hosts most of the events, and conventions that you could find in Miami.</field>

		<field name="content">Michiganders (the feverishly-defended demonym) have a variety of local dialects or accent, depending on the region. Letters or syllables are sometimes removed from longer words ("probably" is almost always shortened to "probly" and sometimes "prolly"; "mirror" sounds like "meer"). Unnecessary prepositions may be added to the end of sentences. When the letter T appears in the middle of a word, it is sometimes pronounced with a D sound, a pronunciation more common in the western U.P. than elsewhere. Michiganders of the U.P. can sound like their Canadian neighbors in Ontario. Context awareness is very important to fully understand some Michiganders in these regions.  When in the middle and southern regions of the Lower Peninsula, you will often hear references to "UpNorth".  When Michiganders in these areas speak of getting away for the weekend, they often say "Im heading UpNorth."  Most frequently, theyre referring to the mostly-rural, wooded areas and scenic shoreline somewhere in the northern areas of the Lower Peninsula. Sometimes, theyre referring to the U.P., but more often youll hear "Im heading up to the U.P."   State highways are referred to as the letter M followed by the highway number. For example, Michigan State Highway 43 becomes M-43. Interstate highways and US highways are usually referred to with the highway number alone. For example, Interstate Highway 94 becomes 94 in conversation. Many counties and cities also employ a number-based naming scheme for local roads and may be referred to by their number alone as well; however, local road numbers and highway numbers rarely overlap. If youll be spending time in a small area of Michigan, take a few minutes to study a map of the area when possible to avoid confusion.   Carbonated soft drinks are most commonly referred to as pop. Coke is a specific kind of pop (regular Coca-Cola), unlike some other areas of the United States. The term "soda" is usually acceptable. The term "soda pop" is nearly unheard of.</field>

Prior to 1728 it was considered a part of Salem, and contains territory previously within the limits of Andover,  Boxford , and  Topsfield . The name Middleton is derived from its location mid way between the important early settlements of  Salem  and  Andover . The town grew as a farming community, mostly due to its location on the Ipswich River, with homesteads of hundreds of acres. However, during the 18th century, Middleton also contained a vital ironworks industry, located in the area of what is now Mill and Liberty streets. This enterprise was carried on for approximately seventy years.  In the late 18th and to the mid-19th centuries Middleton was a vacation town to those who lived in areas such as  Lawrence  and  Lowell .   Middleton is one of the fastest growing towns in the Commonwealth, and the fastest on the North Shore. When locally grouped it is grouped with  Salem ,  Danvers , and  Beverly , but also occasionally  Topsfield  and  Boxford , as these three towns are a tri-town, sharing a high school.</field>

		<field name="content">Milwaukees human history begins with American Indian people who lived near the confluence of Milwaukees three rivers into Lake Michigan for centuries. Tribes who inhabited the area that is now Milwaukee included Menominee, Fox, Mascouten, Sauk, and Potawatomi. With the arrival of Europeans and an increasing population, large and often violent divides become more prominent. These settlers built three dueling settlements (Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walkers Point) around what is now Downtown. The two former communities were extremely competitive and created two non-aligning street grids. This is why 1st Street is west of the Milwaukee River and the reason that many of the citys bridges cross the river diagonally (connecting the two grids).   Milwaukee has historically been a major immigrant city. During the early 20th Century, German and Polish immigrants tended to dominate, and the city still strongly identifies with its German and, to a slightly lesser extent, Polish heritage. For part of the early 20th century German was even the main language of the city, and German names are still very common.   As waves of immigrants arrived in Milwaukee they tended (and tend) to form communities in specific areas. The different areas of the city are still identified with the ethnic groups that originally populated them. The Near North and Northwest sides were originally German, but are now mainly African American with Hmong enclaves. The Near South side was originally Polish but is now mainly Hispanic. Juneautown was originally mainly populated by English immigrants as well as people from the eastern United States.  The city experienced white flight during the 1960s and 70s, creating a large socio-economic divide between the inner city and suburbs. Today the city remains highly segregated with low rates of social and economic mobility within the inner city.  Milwaukee is home to some instantly recognized corporations such as Miller Brewing and Harley Davidson. Harley holds an enormous celebration on every fifth anniversary attracting riders (and celebrity riders such as Jay Leno) by the millions to Milwaukee each time. The 110th anniversary will be held in 2013.   Milwaukee was once the home to four of the worlds largest breweries (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller), making it the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the worlds leading beer producer through the loss of three of those breweries, its one remaining major brewery, Miller Brewing Company is a key employer. Miller employs over 2,200 people on Milwaukees west side. All this beer brewing has earned the city the nickname "Brew City" and its identification with and fondness for beer remains strong as ever.  Milwaukee has advertised itself as the "City of Festivals," especially emphasizing an annual summer party along the lakefront called  Summerfest . Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as "the largest music festival in the world", Summerfest attracts about a million visitors a year to its twelve stages. Smaller ethnic festivals throughout the summer celebrate many of Milwaukees ethnic groups.</field>

In the summer, the temperatures can range from as low as 60°F and as high as 105°F. In the winter, the temperature can drop below 0 regularly but can get as high as 40°F. In general, six months of the year are cold, overcast, and wet. Milwaukee is the second coldest major city in the country; winter is very long and cold! Spring is often very wet and sometimes cold and miserable. It is not unheard of to get snowfall in early April. Winter visitor may quickly get an idea why there are so many bars, bowling alleys and festivals in Milwaukee. The best time to visit is by far in the summer or the early fall during Indian Summer when the whole place comes to life and everybody is outside.</field>

The Preserves unique ecology is attributed to its remarkable geology. The desert is a land of old mountain ranges, sand dunes, great mesas and volcanic features such as cinder cones, domes, and lava flows; these features contribute to the remarkable beauty of the landscape. The most ancient rocks in the preserve, found in the Clark Mountains, are 2.5 billion years old.</field>

		<field name="content">Changes in elevation and soil type, combined with dozens of seeps and springs, many in sheltered canyons, create a wide range of microhabitats that support a rich diversity of plants and animals. Some species are only found in this area. Notable plant assemblages include one of the largest and most dense Joshua tree forests, cactus gardens, and reelect plant communities of white fir and chaparral.  Signs of animal life are subtle and easily overlooked. Birds and lizards are seen most frequently, but time of day, weather, and season all play a role in determining which animals are active.  A large percentage of desert animals are nocturnal: being active at night rather than during daylight hours allows them to avoid both high daytime temperatures and predators. Typical nocturnal animals include most desert rodents, bats, owls, mountain lion, skunks, and foxes. Other animals are crepuscular, active at dawn and dusk, and include coyotes, bighorn sheep and jackrabbits. Diurnal animals, those active during the day, are the most dynamic in that their activity periods will change based on temperature and season.</field>

		<field name="content">Starting in 1941 the streams that fed Mono Lake were diverted for use by the city of Los Angeles.  With a yearly evaporation rate of 45 inches (nearly four feet) the lake level quickly dropped, going from an elevation of 6,417 feet above sea level to a low point of 6,372 feet above sea level.  The accompanying 31% loss of surface area and 50% loss of water volume had a devastating effect on the estimated two million birds that used the lake each year, as well as causing air quality problems due to the dust from the now-exposed lakebed.  In 1994 a court ordered that the lake be returned to a level of 6,392 feet above sea level, but due to droughts in the region the current (2008) level is still only 6,382 feet above sea level.</field>

		<field name="content">The lake is believed to have formed 760,000 years ago, although it may be a remnant of a larger lake that formed 1-3 million years ago, thus making it one of the oldest lakes in North America.  It is a saline lake with no outlets, fed solely by runoff from the surrounding mountains.  One unusual feature of the lake is its many tufa rock formations.  These rock towers form when underwater springs rich in calcium mix with the waters of the lake, which are rich in carbonates.  The resulting reaction forms limestone.  Over time the buildup of limestone forms a tower, and with the drop in lake level the towers have become exposed.</field>

		<field name="content">Mono Lake is a noted birdwatching destination.  Brine shrimp and brine fly larva in the water and brine flies on the shorelines provide abundant food for hungry migrants that stopover to refuel before moving on.  Additionally, despite the fact that Negit Island has become land-bridged (and thus accessible to predators) due to lake level decrease, the areas islands remain important breeding areas for birds.  Approximately 85% of the states population of California gulls cross the Sierras each year to breed here, as well as a significant portion of the states snowy plovers.  In addition, between 1.5 to 2 million eared grebes use the lake during migration each year, as well as 80,000 Wilsons phalaropes, 60,000 red-necked phalaropes, and nearly 80 other species of waterbirds.  The lakes food chain begins with algae that bloom in summer months.  This algae becomes food for the 4-6 trillion brine shrimp that inhabit the lake, as well as the brine flies that gather on the shoreline.  In summer months these flies rise up in black clouds when approached, although luckily they arent biting insects and thus are not a nuisance to humans.</field>

Choking alkali dust clouds can be lifted out of basin by the winds.  Usually, the wind direction sends these clouds out to the east away from the most visited parts, but theres no guarantee that the direction wont change and provide you with a much more intimate opportunity to study the clouds firsthand.  In winter, snow occasionally covers the ground.  Chains may be required to get around the basin, and are frequently required to cross the passes to get in and out of the region.  State Route 120 is closed just west of US 395 all winter (and often all spring), and is closed east of the South Tufa area for much of the winter too.  In summer, if the wind stops suddenly, a cold day can suddenly turn into a scorcher.</field>

		<field name="content">Monticellos first resident was George Haworth. Haworth came to the area in 1822 to serve as a U.S. liaison agent to local Native American tribes. Haworth did not remain, but in 1829, James A. Piatt purchased Haworths small log cabin. Soon more settlers arrived.  In 1837, residents decided to form a new town which was christened Monticello – after the home of Thomas Jefferson. Monticello officially became a town on July 1, 1837. Townsfolk held a celebration on July 4.Monticello continued to grow as the population increased over the next decade.  A new county was established on Jan 27 1841: Piatt County - named in honor the first permanent settler, James A. Piatt. As it was the only town in the area at that time, Monticello was named the county seat. The county began legal functions on April 5, 1841 in the "Old Fort." In 1843, the first courthouse was built on land donated by William H. Piatt.  Monticellos star resident arrived in 1885. Dr. William B. Caldwell came to practice medicine in Monticello but his homemade mixture of senna and pepsin brought Monticello to a level of national prominence. The Pepsin Syrup Company was founded in 1893, and became the leading employer in the city for decades until its closure in 1985. （History from 1985 - now）</field>

Much of the vegetation is still used by the Navajos for medicinal purposes, and as dyes for their world famous hand-woven rugs.   Cryptobiotic soil in Hovenweep National Monument .]]  Cryptobiotic soil crust in Natural Bridges National Monument  near  Sipapu Bridge .]]  Landscapes in the  Four Courners  states often have Cryptobiotic soil, a biological soil crust composed of living cyanobacteria, green algae, brown algae, fungus, lichens, and/or mosses.  Cryptobiotic soil crusts are important members of desert ecosystems and contribute to the well-being of other plants by stabilizing sand and dirt, promoting moisture retention, and fixing nitrogen for plants to use.  Because of their thin, fiberous nature, cryptobiotic soils are extremely fragile systems.  A single footprint or tire track is sufficient to disrupt the soil crust and damage the organisms.  While some species within the soil crust system may regrow within a few years of a disturbance, the damage to slow-growing species may require more than a century before the delicate soil returns to its former productivity.  This sensitivity to disturbance means that travelers should be mindful of their impact on cryptobiotic soils.  As a general rule, visitors should stay on pre-existing roads and trails, only traveling off-trail on durable surfaces such as bedrock or river gravel.</field>

The Lummi Indians near Bellingham Bay called it kulshan, meaning "broken off." Presumably, they were referring to the frequent volcanic activity.  English explorer Captain George Vancouver rededicated the mountain while charting the region in 1792. He named it for Lt. Joseph Baker, a young officer in his command who spotted the peak while their sloop "Discovery" was sailing off the coast of Washington, near Dungeness Bay.</field>

Vegetation is diverse, reflecting the varied climatic and environmental conditions encountered across the park’s 12,800-feet elevation gradient. Approximately 58 percent of the park is forested, 23 percent is subalpine parkland, and the remainder is alpine, half of which is vegetated and the other half consists of permanent snow and ice. Forest ages range from less than 100 years old on burned areas and moraines left by receding glaciers to old-growth stands 1,000 or more years. Some alpine heather communities have persisted in the park for up to 10,000 years.  Species known or thought to occur in the park include more than 800 vascular plants, 159 birds, 63 mammals, 16 amphibians, 5 reptiles, and 18 native fishes.  Commonly seen animals include Columbian black-tailed deer, Douglas squirrels, noisy Stellar’s jays and common ravens.  Other animals that are less-commonly seen but still popular include mammals like elk and black bear, which range in many habitats throughout the summer.  Mountain goats typically remain in alpine or subalpine life zones.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Mount Rushmore is named after Charles E. Rushmore, a New York City attorney who was sent out to this area in 1884 to check legal titles on properties. The giant outcropping of rock was a favorite place that many presidents visited with their families.   The four granite faces that give the mountain its greatest claim to fame were carved over a 14-year period (October 4, 1927 - October 31, 1941) by over 400 workers under the supervision of Gutzon Borglum, an American sculptor. Each face is about 60 feet high; if the bodies were to be included, each figure would be about 460 feet high.  Mount Rushmore is a project of colossal proportion, colossal ambition and colossal achievement. It involved the efforts of nearly 400 men and women. The duties involved varied greatly from the call boy to drillers to the blacksmith to the housekeepers. The workers had to endure conditions that varied from blazing hot to bitter cold and windy. Each day they climbed 700 stairs to the top of the mountain to punch-in on the time clock. Then 3/8 inch thick steel cables lowered them over the front of the 500 foot face of the mountain in a "bosun chair". Some of the workers admitted being uneasy with heights, but during the Depression, any job was a good job.  The work was exciting, but dangerous, 90% of the mountain was carved using dynamite . The powdermen would cut and set charges of dynamite of specific sizes to remove precise amounts of rock. Before the dynamite charges could be set off, the workers would have to be cleared from the mountain. Workers in the winch house on top of the mountain would hand crank the winches to raise and lower the drillers. During the 14 years of construction not one fatality occurred.  Dynamite was used until only three to six inches of rock was left to remove to get to the final carving surface. At this point, the drillers and assistant carvers would drill holes into the granite very close together. This was called honeycombing. The closely drilled holes would weaken the granite so it could be removed often by hand. After the honeycombing, the workers smoothed the surface of the faces with a hand facer or bumper tool. In this final step, the bumper tool would even up the granite, creating a surface as smooth as a sidewalk.  From 1927 to 1941 the 400 workers at Mount Rushmore physically sculpted, through the rock and soil, a landmark that people from across the nation and around the world would travel to see for generations to come.</field>

In the early 1960’s, the suburbanization of the once vast farmland increased.  Many people migrated east to escape the “city-life” and retreat to a quiet, family oriented suburban area. Within the past ten years, the development of Mt. Sinai has been aimed at building private communities and classic housing developments.  Some of the most recent include Island Estates, The Orchards, The Ranches  and The Hamlet.

		<field name="content">On March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens awakened from over 100 years of dormancy with a magnitude 4.1 earthquake which began a series of events leading to eruption.  Steam and ash eruption started on March 27, and over the next two months the north side of the mountain started bulging at the rate of about 5 to 6 feet a day.  Then on May 18, 1980, at 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake caused the bulging north face to collapse in one of the largest landslides in recorded history.  The highly pressurized magma burst forth in an explosive eruption, sending super-heated volcanic gas and ash across a large portion of the United States, destroying hundreds of square miles of forest, and killing 57 people in what was the most destructive volcanic eruption in the United States.  Today, over a quarter century later, life is starting to return to the barren landscape surrounding the mountain.  However, as the recent steam eruptions starting in October 2004 have illustrated, the danger of another catastrophic eruption is ever present.  Visiting Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is to simultaneously witness the result of catastrophic destruction and see the result of rebirth.</field>

		<field name="content">Mount St. Helens is a typical "stratovolcano," the volcanic form most familiar from photographs of their typically conical profiles.  The great 1980 eruption destroyed most of the volcanic cone, leaving a huge amphitheater on the north side that is well seen from the Johnston Ridge observatory/visitor center.  Current (2004-5) volcanic activity is building a new lava dome within this amphitheater, visible from the "VolcanoCam" at the observatory but not yet large enough to replace the destroyed cone.   panoramic view of Mount St Helens   St. Helens is still glaciated to some extent, despite its reduced altitude.  One unexpected and remarkable bit of landscape on the mountain is the astonishing Loowit Falls, a waterfall that emerges directly from the amphitheater bearing meltwater from a glacier within the crater.  This falls can be seen (use binoculars) from the observatory, but to get the best feeling for the incongruity of the falls -- it seems to emerge as though from the surface of the moon -- requires a hike on a trail that is closed as of 2005 owing to the volcanic activity.</field>

		<field name="content">As you explore the Monument its easy to see the results of 30 years of ecosystem recovery. Plants that sprouted from buried soil and late lying snow banks have gradually spread, transforming a gray-brown landscape to green. Over time, these initial survivors have been joined by legions of colonizers as wind blown seeds of weedy plants like fireweed and pearly everlasting have taken root on shattered hillsides. In spring the Monument glows with the purple blossoms of penstemon and lupine. By late summer, magenta fireweed and patches of cream-colored pearly everlasting frame the blown down forest. In fall, Monument breezes will dance with cotton-covered seeds as life continues its march across the blast zone.  Watch for animals that have taken up residence in the developing forest. The once silent blast zone is punctuated by the calls of killdeer and red-winged blackbirds that have made their homes in lush shoreline vegetation. Red-tailed hawks can be spotted hunting for abundant mouse populations while osprey dive for trout in blast zone lakes. The open valleys and hillsides are a favorite feeding ground for North American elk. If you listen you can sometimes catch the echo of a whistling elk or maybe the howl of a lonely coyote.</field>

Other high peaks -- Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison -- the Northern Presidentials arc to the north and northeast.  Massive Chandler Ridge heads ENE over secondary summits before descending to the valley of the Peabody River.  An automobile road ascends this ridge.  Great Gulf -- a large glacial cirque -- lies between Chandler Ridge and the Northern Presidentials.  East of the peak are two more cirques, Tuckermanss Ravine famous for spring skiing, and steeper Huntington Ravine attracting rock climbers in summer and ice climbers in winter, however these face away from the summit and are not visible from it.  Distant views extend east across the Carter Range to the lowlands of southern  Maine .  At night, light from Portland and other coastal cities may be visible, but the Atlantic Ocean is just over the horizon.  South of the peak is a plateau above 5,000 (1,500m) named Bigelow Lawn.  Beyond there are two major ridges.  The higher ridge -- Southern Presidentials -- heads SW along a series of minor alpine peaks mostly named after presidents to Crawford Notch.  Montalban Ridge heads south and rapidly drops below treeline beyond prominent Boott Spur.  Oakes Gulf separates the two southern ridges.    Many other peaks of the White Mountains, especially the Franconia Range lie to the SW.   Vermont s  Green Mountains  and  New York s  Adirondacks  are to the west.</field>

Flora is limited to lichens, grass and alpine herbs, including a dwarf variety of cranberry.  About 1/2 mile (1 km) east of the park and some 1,000 (300m) lower, Alpine Gardens occupies a small plateau area at the head of ancient glacial cirques.  Alpine Gardens are known for abundant alpine herbs and grasses, and for displays of flowers in late spring-early summer.  The Alpine is to be protected so it can flourish properly, and it is encouraged for hikers to watch their steps not to crush them.  Homo sapiens touristicus is by far the most abundant fauna, but limited numbers of birds and insects inhabit the alpine zone in the warmest months.</field>

		<field name="content">Nashville was founded in 1779 and it grew rapidly because of its excellent location on the Cumberland River. It was incorporated in 1806 and became the county seat of Davidson County. Nashville was named the capital of Tennessee in 1843.  Like many Southern cities, Nashville was not immune to the economic woes of the post-Civil War South but it quickly rebounded. It only took a few years for the city to reclaim its important shipping and trading position and to develop a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a new found prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.  Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor (former Tennessee Governor) Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Public Library downtown, Bridgestone Arena, and LP Field.  :For more information please visit the Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau, 150 Fourth Avenue North, +1 615 259-4730,</field>

		<field name="content">Nashville sits in the middle of a geographic region known as the Nashville Basin. It is surrounded by the Cumberland Highlands and is bordered by the Cumberland Plateau to the east. The Nashville Basin is characterized by rich, fertile farm country and high natural wildlife diversity.  Nashville has cool, relatively short winters and hot, humid summers, with long spells of spring and autumn in between. Winter temperatures commonly hover slightly above freezing, and a fair amount of light snow generally falls throughout the months of December to February, though large storms of 6-plus inches in a day do occur every few years. Nashville can be prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the spring and fall months. Summers are hot, but no more than the rest of the southeastern U.S. with temperatures around 90F (32C) during the day.</field>

		<field name="content">Owachomo Bridge  Repeatedly occupied and abandoned during prehistoric times, the area was first used during the Archaic period, from 7000 B.C. to A.D. 500. Only the rock art and stone tools left by hunter-gatherer groups reveal that humans lived here then. Around AD 700, ancestors of modern Puebloan people moved onto the mesa tops to dry farm and later left as the natural environment changed. Around A.D. 1100, new migrants from across the San Juan River moved into small, single-family houses near the deepest, best-watered soils throughout this area. In the 1200s, farmers from Mesa Verde migrated here, but by the 1300s the ancestral Puebloans migrated south. Navajos and Paiutes lived in the area during later times, and Navajo oral tradition holds that their ancestors lived among the early Puebloans.  In 1883, prospector Cass Hite wandered up White Canyon from his base camp along the Colorado River in search of gold. What he found instead were three magnificent bridges water had sculpted from stone. In 1904, National Geographic Magazine publicized the bridges, and in 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt established Natural Bridges National Monument, creating Utahs first National Park Service area.</field>

		<field name="content">Access of the Kachina Bridge  While arches stand on the skyline, natural bridges form in the bottoms of deep canyons.  This difference is due to how each is formed: seeping moisture and frost shape arches, but running water carves natural bridges. As the curving meanders of streams carved down into the sandstone at Natural Bridges they undercut the canyon walls and bent back upon themselves until only a thin fin of stone separated them. Flash floods periodically pounded against weak spots formed by the soft siltstone layers in the sandstone. Eventually, the water cut through the narrow neck of the meander, forming a natural bridge. At first each bridge is thick and massive, as is Kachina Bridge, but as erosion attacks them on all sides, the bridges become more delicate (as with Owachomo Bridge) and eventually collapse.  Geologically speaking, the bridges themselves are relatively recent and short-lived occurrences.  Since sandstone erodes at different rates (more weathering occurs when the climate is wet than during times of aridity), the exact age of the bridges is difficult to determine. We do know that ten million years ago the Colorado Plateau was flat and featureless. When the last glacial period ended 18,000 years ago, glacial melt and increased rainfall speeded the erosion of canyon country. A wet climate between 900 and 4,000 years ago probably began the erosion of most spans; the largest spans are believed to be over 5,000 years old.</field>

		<field name="content">Birds, desert cottontails, kangaroo rats and lizards are common and may be seen by a majority of visitors. Many desert animals are either inactive during daylight hours or wary of humans, so sightings can be special events.  The areas hot climate and lack of water seems to favor small mammals. Because of their size, these animals have an easier time finding shelter and require less food and water to live. Rodents are numerous, with nine species of mice and rats alone.  Large mammals like mule deer and mountain lions must roam vast territories in order to find food and water, and sometimes migrate to nearby mountains during summer.  The desert climate also favors reptiles like lizards and snakes. Natural Bridges has several known rattlesnake dens. The midget faded rattlesnake, a subspecies of the widely distributed western rattlesnake, is the most common. During spring, these dens may contain several dozen snakes. Though small (usually around 24 inches long), the midget faded rattlesnake has a very toxic venom.  Amphibians may be the last thing people think of when they visit Natural Bridges. However, the area is home to a variety of frogs and toads, as well as one species of salamander. These animals take advantage of intermittent springs and pools when they are available and remain dormant during drier periods. Witnessing a chorus of toads in White Canyon may be one of the most memorable experiences canyon country has to offer.  Plants in the park fall into three basic categories: drought escapers, drought resistors and drought evaders.  Drought escapers are plants that make use of favorable growing conditions when they exist. These plants are usually annuals that grow only when enough water is available. Seeds may lie dormant for years if conditions are not favorable. Spring annual wildflowers are escapers. They sprout following winter and early spring rains, and sometimes again after late summer rains.  Drought resistors are typically perennials. Many have small, spiny leaves that reduce the impact of solar radiation, and some may drop their leaves if water is unavailable. Spines and hairy leaves act to reduce exposure to air currents and solar radiation, limiting the amount of water lost to evaporation. Cacti, yuccas and mosses are examples of drought resistors. Yuccas have extensive taproots that are able to find water beyond the reach of other plants. Moss, a plant not commonly associated with deserts, thrives because it can tolerate complete dehydration: when rains finally return, mosses green up immediately.  Drought evaders, the final group, survive in riparian areas where water is plentiful. Monkey flower, columbine and maidenhair fern are found in well-shaded alcoves near seeps or dripping springs. Cottonwoods and willows require a lot of water, and only grow along river corridors and intermittent streams where their roots can reach the water table easily.</field>

Summer temperatures often exceed 100 F, making strenuous exercise difficult. Late summer monsoon season brings violent storm cells which often cause flash floods. Winters are cold, with highs averaging 30 to 50 F, and lows averaging 0 to 20 F.

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Archaeological evidence has shown that humans have existed in New Mexico for at least 13,000 years now, as shown by the existence of "Clovis points" - arrowheads first found near the town of  Clovis . For the next several millennium, a long line of Native American cultures lived, prospered, and perished here, the most well-known being the Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the "Anasazi", though that term has recently fallen out of favor) who emerged around AD 700 and by AD 1100 has established impressive settlements in what is now the northwestern region of the state and were part of a far-flung trade network that reached south to what is now Mexico. However, in the 12th and 13th centuries they abandoned their settlements for reasons not entirely clear; drought, environmental degradation, pressure from other groups, and religious or cultural change are all considered possibilities. It is commonly believed today that the inhabitants of todays Pueblos of New Mexico are the descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans.  Of course, Puebloans were not the only Native American group to establish themselves here; despite changing climates, war, and European and later American aggression, many Navajos, Apaches, Comanches, and Utes also make the state their home today.  The first Europeans to arrive in New Mexico were the Spanish. The explorer Cabeza de Vaca may have passed through a portion of the area, but it was the expedition of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado in the 1540s that marked the first significant European contact in the area. Coronado came seeking the mythical Seven Cities of Gold, but found nothing of the sort. His contact with the Puebloan residents in New Mexico was marked by violence against the Natives, which sadly set the stage for more bloodshed to come.  Though Coronado returned to Mexico in disgrace, his reports paved the way for the first settlers to arrive in 1598, who were led by Juan de Oñate and established the first European village in the area near present-day Española.  Oñate displayed vicious cruelty toward the Puebloans, and after being chewed out by the Spanish Empire a new governor was appointed who led the construction of a capitol city, Santa Fe.  Over the next several decades, the Puebloans continued to be the victims of repression on the part of the Spanish, particularly Franciscan missionaries who found that while many Puebloans were receptive to Catholicism, they were also unwilling to abandon their traditional religions. Tension grew until finally the Pueblos banded together in 1680 to drive the Spanish out of New Mexico. It wouldnt be for another 12 years that Europeans returned, this time through a reconquest led by Diego de Vargas. Though there were some military campaigns involved, the Pueblo Revolt had taught the Spanish the consequences of oppression and the Puebloans were granted rights and land in exchange for allowing the Spanish to live side-by-side with them. This partnership largely worked; indeed, Spaniards and Puebloans frequently banded together to wage war against the nomadic tribes (Apaches, Comanches, Navajos) in the area.  Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, but New Mexicos isolation meant that little changed in the relationship between the settlers and rulers, with the exception that Mexico was more willing to trade with the United States. This set the stage for the creation of the Santa Fe Trail - a rugged wagon route that brought American goods and settlers to New Mexico, as well as opening the floodgates to encroachment from the east. An attempt on the part of the then-independent Republic of Texas to gain control of New Mexico ended in humiliating defeat, but within several years Texas was part of the U.S. and the vision of an America "stretching from sea to shining sea" brought New Mexico into the Mexican-American War. Mexican officials didnt focus much on defending New Mexico - American General Stephen W. Kearny marched into Santa Fe without firing a shot - but the residents reacted to U.S. presence with a mixture of welcome and deep suspicion; New Mexicos early years as a U.S. territory were marked by rebellion and bitter land disputes.  Under American rule, New Mexico experienced combat in the American Civil War. Most of New Mexico remained loyal to the Union, and Confederate forces mounted a campaign to stake their claim here.  Their presence was short-lived however, as Union forces soon drove them back south after winning a couple of key battles near Santa Fe. The Civil War over, the Union returned to focus on breaking the Comanche, Navajo, and Apache forces in the area, with considerable success.   The arrival of the railroad in 1880 brought numerous new settlers to the area and caused an explosion of growth in towns along the rail lines. Ranching and mining came to New Mexico in full force, becoming the mainstay of the economy. Following statehood in 1912, a new set of visitors came to New Mexico as the state shed its wild west image: artists established themselves in the Santa Fe and Taos areas, tourists came via the railroad to experience the scenery and culture of the Southwest, and tuberculosis patients came to live the rest of their lives in New Mexicos mild climate.  With the rise of the automobile came the arrival of Route 66, bringing a new wave of arrivals to the state.  World War II brought a new industry to New Mexico: nuclear science. The worlds first atomic bomb was constructed in the top secret government town of Los Alamos and tested at the Trinity site in southern New Mexico. Federal investment in military research brought money and new migrants to the state, which coincided with considerable urban growth in parts of the state, particularly the Albuquerque area.  The 1960s and 70s manifested itself in civil rights battles for Latinos and the arrival of a large number of Hippies in the northern part of the state who were attracted by New Mexicos relative isolation.  The last couple of decades have seen a modernization effort in New Mexico. The metro areas of Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces are still experiencing major urban growth, and the typical features of todays built American landscape - cell phone towers, gas stations, Wal-Marts - have certainly arrived, along with the problems - traffic, pollution, etc. However, New Mexico remains a place isolated enough from the rest of the country that one can still venture out of the city and find great, wild beauty, and still catch a glimpse of what New Mexico was like hundreds of years ago.</field>

		<field name="content">New Mexico seems to suffer from the paradox of having a lot of artists, writers, filmmakers, and other purveyors of culture, yet rarely is actually named in cultural works, instead standing in as a generic "Southwestern" place. The areas around Santa Fe and Taos have long been home to artist colonies who find inspiration in the beauty of the states natural scenery, while many, many films and television shows have been filmed at least in part here (especially recently, given state tax credits for the film industry), using New Mexico as a stand-in for desert or Western scenes. Its not hard to find New Mexico in popular works, but it can be difficult to find ones that take full advantage of both the unique beauty and the culture of the state.   Of the many artists who came to northern New Mexico in the early 20th century, the painter Georgia OKeeffe is perhaps the most famous. OKeeffe eventually settled in  Abiquiu  and used the local scenery to extensive effect in her later works (today, a museum devoted exclusively to her work sits in Santa Fe). Other notables who came to New Mexico around the same time are the writer D.H. Lawrence, whose ranch near Taos now holds his ashes, and famed photographer Ansel Adams, who regularly used New Mexico as a subject in his work.   The Atomic City (Jerry Hopper, 1952). This black-and-white film from the Cold War days took advantage of the then-recently publicly revealed existence of Los Alamos (birthplace of the atomic bomb), focusing around a nuclear scientist whose child is kidnapped. Scenes set in and around Los Alamos, Santa Fe, and a climatic sequence taking place on a nearby Indian ruin make excellent use of the local scenery.   Easy Rider (Dennis Hopper, 1969). While New Mexico isnt mentioned by name, much of the first half of the film is set in a hippie commune near Taos, giving a sense of what drew people to this remote area to eke out a living from the land and also serving as a great backdrop to the films themes of freedom, the American Dream, and the issues of the 1960s.   The Milagro Beanfield War (John Nichols, 1974). This popular novel (which was made into a movie of the same name by Robert Redford in 1988) centers around a Hispanic farming community in northern New Mexico trying to defend itself against outside business and state political interests, speaking to the real-life struggles of New Mexicos Hispanic communities to preserve their way of life.   Breaking Bad (Vince Gilligan, 2008-2013). Of the many films and television shows filmed in New Mexico recently, the popular AMC series is one of the very few that is not only set here, but really makes the most of it. Centered around a high school chemistry teacher who resorts to cooking meth, the series effectively uses Albuquerques culture and stark beauty as a backdrop to the main characters rise and fall within the local drug trade (which is indeed a major problem for New Mexico law enforcement).</field>

		<field name="content">Bourbon Street, French Quarter at night   New Orleans is known for a host of attributes like its famous Creole food, abundant alcohol, music of many styles, nearby swamps and plantations, 18th 19th century architecture, antiques, gay pride, streetcars, museums. Nicknamed the Big Easy, New Orleans has long had a reputation as an adult oriented city. However, the city also offers many attractions for families with children and those interested in culture and the arts. It is a city with a majority Roman Catholic population owing to its European origins.  Famous festivals like Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest bring in tourists by the millions, and are the two times of the year when one needs to be sure to book well in advance to be sure of a room. The city also hosts numerous smaller festivals and gatherings like the French Quarter Festival, Creole Tomato Festival, Satchmo SummerFest, the Essence Festival hosted by the magazine, Halloween parading and costume balls, Saint Patricks Day and Saint Josephs Day parading, Southern Decadence, and so many more. The city takes almost any occasion for an excuse for a parade, a party, and live music, and in New Orleans most events often have a touch of Mardi Gras year round. Like they say, New Orleanians are either planning a party, enjoying one or recovering from one. Party down!  It is a city of great culture with a clash of French, Cajun and some Spanish designs. You may see some voodoo activity at night.  The trolley rides are fun and many of the stores carry exclusive cultural art such as the blue dog collection.</field>

		<field name="content">In August 2005 New Orleans and the surrounding area was hit by Hurricane Katrina. Much worse than the hurricane was the failure of the federally designed levee system; in what has been called "the worst civil engineering disaster in U.S. history" when some 80% of the city flooded.   New Orleans was not destroyed, but the flood was a severe blow, perhaps the worst disaster to hit a U.S. city since the great  San Francisco  earthquake 99 years previous.  Six years later, many visitors might notice little or no sign that anything bad happened.  For locals, however, rebuilding is still an ongoing process.  The French Quarter and other oldest parts of town most popular with visitors were built on comparative high ground, and were less damaged and have been more quickly restored.  However, not everything is back to normal in the city; scenes of devastation can be still seen in many neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of the citys pre-Katrina population is back living in the city; most of them have a fierce love of their city and have faced many hardships in their continuing efforts to rebuild it bit by bit.  The citys public services - especially police - have struggled to return to their full strength, and are dealing with a city where decades of neighborhood stability have been disrupted.  The city overall has experienced an increase in crime as a result.  (See "Stay safe" below.)  While some visitors decide to confine their trip to the more fully intact parts of the city or just visit the worse hit areas as part of a half-day "disaster tour", for others the historic events of Katrina and its aftermath are the focus of their visit.  Volunteer projects such as  New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity  which builds new houses has attracted volunteers doing good work.  Organizations such as  Levees.org  are vigilant in encouraging further investigation into the flooding and hurricane protection issues surrounding New Orleans, and visitors to the city are encouraged to tour ravaged areas and help keep alive the attention needed to restore New Orleans to its original grandeur.</field>

		<field name="content">Jackson Square is the historic heart of the French Quarter   In the late 1600s, French trappers and traders began settling in what is now New Orleans, along a Native American trade route between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John. In 1718 the city was officially founded as "Nouvelle-Orléans" by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, Governor of the French colony of Louisiana, with the intent to build it into a provincial capital city. The early French city grew within the grid of what is now the French Quarter. Louisiana was transferred to Spanish rule in the 1760s, but much of the population retained French language and culture.  After briefly returning to French rule, Louisiana was purchased by the United States in 1803.  At first the new "American" settlers mostly built their homes and shops upriver from the older French parts of the city, across wide "Canal Street" (named for a planned canal that was never built).  Canal Street was the dividing line between the Anglophone and Francophone sections; the streets wide median became a popular meeting place called "the neutral ground"—and "neutral ground" became the common phrase for the median of any street, still in use in the New Orleans dialect today.  A British attempt to seize the city in 1815 was repelled downriver from the city in  Chalmette  by local forces led by Andrew Jackson, whose equestrian statue can be seen in the square named after him in the center of the old Quarter.  Early New Orleans was already a rich melting pot of peoples and cultures. French Spanish African and Anglos were joined by immigrants from Ireland, Germany, and the Caribbean. While a center of the slave trade before the American Civil War, New Orleans also had the USAs largest population of free people of color.  The city grew rapidly as a major trade center on the mighty Mississippi River.  In the American Civil War of the 1860s, New Orleans fell to the Union early in the conflict without battle within the city, sparing the citys rich historic architecture from the destruction suffered by much of the American South.   At the start of the 20th century, the then largely neglected old French Quarter started gaining new appreciation among artists and bohemians for its architecture and ambiance. Around the same time, a new musical style developed in the city; the music developed and swept around the world under the name of "jazz".   Although far from the big battlefronts, New Orleans is proud of its contributions to the Allied victory over Fascism in World War II, especially the development and construction of landing craft such as "Higgins Boats" which made rapid landing masses of troops on hostile beaches possible. This legacy is why Americas National World War II Museum is located in the city.</field>

		<field name="content">A local joke has it that New Orleans really does have four seasons: Summer, Hurricane, Christmas, and Mardi Gras.  Summer is certainly the longest; for about half the year, from about late April to the start of October, the days are usually hot, or raining, or hot and raining.  Winters are generally short and mild, but subject to occasional cold snaps that may surprise visitors who mistakenly think the city has a year round tropical climate.  The high humidity can make the cold snaps feel quite penetrating. Snow is so rare that the occasional light dusting of flakes will make most locals stop what they are doing to stare; theyll excitedly show the phenomenon to local children too young to remember the last time snow visited the city.  If you happen to be visiting town during a rare freezing event, be forewarned that most locals have no idea how to drive on iced or snowy roads.   The Atlantic hurricane season (which includes all of the Gulf of Mexico) is June 1 through November 30. The most active month is September.  Some say the best time to visit New Orleans is between late November and early June.  However New Orleans has things going on all year long.  A rewarding visit can be made even the hottest part of the summer: Start your day early, and do your outdoor sightseeing in the morning.  The lush local flora can display a wealth of colorful flowers. Mid-day and afternoon, retreat to air-conditioning; visit a museum, have a leisurely visit to a cafe or restaurant, or take a siesta at your hotel.  Come back outside when the sun gets low. After dark the night shift of flora comes on duty; especially in older neighborhoods such as Esplanade Ridge, Carrollton, the Garden District, etc. with an abundance of night-blooming jasmine, the sweet deliciously scented air can be almost intoxicating.</field>

		<field name="content">Despite what many visitors expect, the population, food, music, and traditions of New Orleans are not predominately Cajun. The Acadian or Cajun (from Cadien, pronounced kay-juhn) people developed their rich culture to the west of the city, in the  Acadiana  section of Louisiana. While there are some good places for Cajun food and music in the city—some are branches of famous Southwest Louisiana Cajun places that opened up locations here—understand that Cajun food and culture are a recent import that has no roots in New Orleans. Unfortunately a number of businesses in the most tourist heavy parts of town decided to profit by selling visitors what they thought they wanted, slapping the term "Cajun" on dishes and products with little to do with Acadiana.  The oldest aspects of New Orleans culture are Creole—which here designates the people that were already here before the city became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.  French, Spanish, and African are the primary ethnic and cultural groups in old Creole culture, with additional input from Native Americans and early German immigrants (who became much more numerous later in the 19th century).    Since the Louisiana Purchase, other major immigrant groups and influences on local cuisine and culture have included Italian (mostly Southern and Sicilian), Irish, German, Caribbean and Central American. Hondurans are traditionally the largest Hispanic group in the metro area, but after Katrina, there is now an influx of Latinos, mostly hailing from Central America and Mexico that have decided to stay after helping in the construction boom in the aftermath of Katrina. Smaller populations of Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans are also sparsely located throughout the area. In the late 20th century a sizable Vietnamese community was added to the New Orleans gumbo. They can be found in greatest concentrations in New Orleans East and portions of the Westbank suburbs (Marrero, Harvey, Gretna).</field>

		<field name="name">historical background</field>
		<field name="content">The area on the river side of St. Claude Avenue developed during the great expansion of New Orleans in the 19th century.  The land further away from the river contained scattered houses on plots of farmland; much of the area maintained a more "rural" look into the start of the 20th century.    In the 1910s, the Industrial Canal, a shipping and navigation canal between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, was built.  It bisected the citys 9th Ward; after the Canal was built people started talking about the two sections as the "Upper 9th Ward" (meaning upriver from the Canal) and "Lower 9th Ward" (meaning downriver from the Canal; contrary to assumptions of people from elsewhere after the Katrina disaster, it has nothing to do with elevation).  The Canal led to much more development of the "back" portions of the Ward; many laborers in the port facilities built their houses here.    Fats Dominos House after the floodwaters were drained, late 2005   In the 1940s, musicians of this area created a new musical style of what was then called "rhythm blues".  Fats Domino became the most famous; many of his neighbors also made records in the 1940s and 50s, including the bands that accompanied artists from elsewhere like Little Richard who came to New Orleans to record their hits.  Some music historians argue that if the origin of rock roll can be pinned to any one neighborhood, it would have to be the Lower 9th Ward.  Hurricane Betsy struck Louisiana in 1965. The new MRGO Canal channeled in storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into the Lower 9th Ward and neighboring  Saint Bernard Parish , flooding the majority of it.  The Lower 9th Ward declined in the last quarter of the 20th century, as the port facilities replaced many laborers with automation.  Poverty, drug abuse, and related crime grew in the neighborhood. Still, many locals were proud of the Lower 9th Ward for its rich traditions and high rate of Black home ownership.  In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana.  The levee and floodwall system built after Hurricane Betsy to prevent a repeat of the 1965 disaster quickly crumbled—investigations after the fact showed mistakes in the designs (though more than a few locals will say they suspect deliberate sabotage to destroy the predominantly Black neighborhood).  Flooding was much worse than in Betsy, and areas that remained high and dry in 1965 found themselves over their heads in water. Collapsing floodwalls unleashed walls of water which bulldozed blocks full of homes into splinters, killing many.  Most of the Federal responders were housed in the Lower 9ths Jackson Barracks; when the wall of water came they could do little more than struggle to save themselves.    Similar tales of disaster in 2005 could be told about many other neighborhoods in Greater New Orleans: black, white, and mixed; poor, middle-class, and rich.  But the Lower 9th became emblematic of the destruction.  Most of the area was so devastated it remained barricaded off when other sections of the city were first reopened.  Drinkable running water was restored to the first New Orleans neighborhoods in October of 2005; it did not come to the Lower 9th until October of 2006.</field>

		<field name="content">Before European settlement, the area now known as New York was home to a number of Native American tribes.  The Iroquois Confederacy (or Haudenosaunee), comprising the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, and Tuscarora tribes, was a major early exercise in representative democracy.  European settlement of New York began at New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island.  From there, Dutch and then English settlers expanded northward along the Hudson River to present-day Albany, then west along the Mohawk River.  Sites in this area of New York were pivotal in the Revolutionary War, especially at Saratoga north of Albany, and New York City served briefly as the nations first capital.  Settlement further west was impeded by poor terrain and Indian territories, but by the early 19th century, even those areas were becoming well settled.  A true population explosion was brought on by the construction of the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany, completed in 1825.  Cities like Rochester grew up almost overnight, able to ship their goods easily to points both east and west, and New York City at the mouth of the Hudson became the young countrys busiest and most important harbor.  New York grew and thrived for decades, its cities serving as centers of industry, business, and culture for the entire nation.  Even as more and more western areas opened up and began to be settled, New York remained the Empire State.  New York Harbor served as the point of entry for countless immigrants after the Civil War, which contributed to a diverse, energetic population.  New York held the title of most populous for over 150 years and has counted numerous important and influential figures among its native sons and daughters.  Since the middle of the twentieth century, New Yorks influence has waned somewhat as California, Texas, and Florida have swelled in population, but New York remains one of the most dominant states in the nation.</field>

		<field name="content">There is no concise way to describe the geography of New York, except maybe to say it is "diverse".  The city of New York, a major Atlantic port, is of course at sea level.  It serves as a small fulcrum connecting  Long Island  (to the east) and the rest of the state (to the north)—to reach one from the other, one must pass through New York City.  North of the city lies the vast majority of the state, known as "Upstate New York".  The land rises as one goes north, following the Hudson River upstream.  The river cuts a gorge through these Appalachian highlands, forming a wide river valley.  To the west of this valley, the Catskills rise—a "dissected plateau" to geologists, but just "mountains" to laymen.  Beyond the Catskills, the terrain drops and levels, forming the rolling hills of the Southern Tier.  North of the Catskills is the Mohawk River valley, which runs from west to east into the Hudson.  Further west, you will find the Finger Lakes region, a series of long skinny lakes formed when river valleys were blocked by debris from retreating glaciers.  North of the Finger Lakes, between them and Lake Ontario, lie large swaths of lowlands, areas which were once underneath the surface of a much larger, pre-glacial Lake Ontario.  North of the Mohawk valley and east of Lake Ontario, you can find the vast mountain range of the Adirondacks, which gradually give way to the St. Lawrence River valley in the northernmost part of the state.</field>

		<field name="content">The brilliant colors of autumn in New York   New York has four distinct seasons.  Upstate New York is well known for its brutal winters.  Although temperatures dont get as low as they do in areas like Minnesota and North Dakota, thanks in part to the giant heat reservoir known as Lake Ontario, that same lake serves to generate plenty of lake-effect snow.  That being said, it is not unheard of for temperatures to drop into the single digits or even below zero, especially in areas of the Adirondacks and North Country, away from the Lake. The major upstate cities compete each year for the "coveted" Golden Snowball Award for most total inches of snow—one small measure of pride for a city digging itself out from piles of snow several feet deep.  Snow is especially heavy to the east of Lake Ontario.  Clouds pick up moisture as they travel over the lakes longest dimension, then dump it all on  Watertown  as they are forced to rise by the Tug Hill Plateau.  New York City is downright tropical by comparison.  With the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Big Apple benefits from the warm Gulf Stream waters without having to deal with ocean-effect snow.  Spring in New York tends to start out cold and damp, especially in areas near Lake Ontario, as the Lakes waters have by then been thoroughly chilled by winter.  True springtime comes around May, segueing quickly into summer.  Summer features brilliant sun that is only rarely scorching, with occasional heat waves.  Humidity is often high but the months are punctuated by spells of lower humidity that bring everyone outside to enjoy the weather.  Leaves start to turn color in September; at their peak, New Yorks leaf scenery is among the best in the country.  By late October, though, its all over but the raking, and winter begins to set in, with snow often falling by Halloween.</field>

It is separated from The Bronx on the north east by the Harlem River (actually a tidal strait); from Queens and Brooklyn to the east and south by the East River (also a tidal strait); and from the State of New Jersey to the west and north by the Hudson River. Staten Island lies to the south west, across Upper New York Bay.  In Manhattan, the terms “uptown” and “north” mean northeast,  while “downtown” and “south” mean to the southwest. To avoid confusion, simply use “uptown” and “downtown.” Street numbers continue from Manhattan into the Bronx, and the street numbers rise as one moves farther north (however, in the Bronx, there is no simple numerical grid, so there may be 7 blocks between 167 St. and 170 St., for example). Avenues run north and south. In Brooklyn, street numbers rise as one moves south. Queens streets are laid out in a perpendicular grid – street numbers rise as one moves toward the east, and avenues run east and west. Staten Islands grid system is small and insignificant, only covering one neighborhood.  The term “the city” may refer either to New York City as a whole, or to the borough of Manhattan alone, depending on the context. The other boroughs - Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens - are sometimes referred to as the "outer boroughs.”</field>

Manhattans Chinatown remains a vibrant center of New York Citys Chinese community, though in recent years the very large Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, has rivaled if not eclipsed it in importance, and three other Chinatowns have formed in New York City: the Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park; the Elmhurst Chinatown in Queens; and the Avenue U Chinatown located in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn. Traces of the Lower East Sides once-thriving Jewish community still exist amid the newly-gentrified neighborhoods trendy restaurants and bars, but there are Chassidic communities in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Harlem has been gentrifying and diversifying and remains a center of African-American culture in New York. East (Spanish) Harlem still justifies its reputation as a large Hispanic neighborhood. Little known to most tourists are the large Dominican neighborhoods of Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. Brooklyns Greenpoint is famous for its large and vibrant Polish community, and the Flatbush section - once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers - is today a huge and thriving Caribbean and West Indian section.

For example, the average July high in Charlotte, and most central NC cities, is 90°F (32°C).  In the mountains of Asheville, the average July high is only 84°F (29°C), and highs below 90°F are also found on the coast.  For travelers coming from warmer climates, summers in North Carolina are quite nice, especially in the mountains.  During the summer, high humidity combined with summer temperatures above 90°F may be hazardous for senior citizens and those of ill health.  Between the months of June and August, heat advisories are not uncommon. The good news about the heat is the air and ocean water temperatures, particularly for the Southeast NC beaches, remain comfortable for swimming and beach-going well into September, if not October.  In general, for travelers coming from cooler climates, the heat and humidity of southern summers can be a shock, making spring and fall much more attractive.  During the Fall season, the Blue Ridge Mountains are a popular destination due to the beauty of the foliage.  In the winter, the mountains of northwestern North Carolina offer skiing and other winter sports. It should be noted that northwestern North Carolina has a distinct climate even for North Carolina. The area termed "The High Country" due to its elevation, has a climate more related to areas of New England and parts of the Upper Midwest, as compared to other areas of the South. This is particularly true in the winter, where the area gets considerably more snow and wintry precipitation than the rest of the state. The area, also, stays, on average, much cooler year round than other parts of the state.</field>

		<field name="content">Archeological evidence from over 8000 years ago shows that the area contained large Native populations divided by the rugged topography of the North Cascades. The peoples of the Columbia River Basin to the east and those of the Pacific Northwest/Puget Lowlands to the west. A trade network connected and enabled them to share locally abundant resources. They traveled across mountain passes to trade. They followed ridge crests to avoid dense brush along avalanche shoots and stream bottoms.  The difficulty of travel across these rugged mountains made intimate knowledge of them extremely important. Routes to the major mountain passes were vital to indigenous peoples.</field>

Seeking to follow the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, these explorers entered only the lower reaches of the North Cascades. The earliest recorded crossing of the North Cascades by a Euro-American occurred in 1814. Alexander Ross, a fur trader, crossed Twisp Pass, followed the Stehekin River eventually crossing Cascade Pass, he traced the Cascade River downstream to its confluence with the Skagit River. Maps of Washington Territory in 1860 show large areas still labeled "unexplored."</field>

		<field name="content">In the 1850s, prospectors began searching for gold along the banks of the Skagit River. After gold was discovered along Ruby Creek in the late 1870s, hundreds of miners swarmed over the upper Skagit valley. They found little gold, and the rush was over by 1880.  Over the next few decades, miners turned their attention to other minerals, primarily silver and lead, located higher in the mountains. New claims were established in the high country around Cascade Pass, including Doubtful Lake, Boston and Horseshoe Basins and Bridge Creek. A rich silver deposit was found just below Boston Glacier near the headwaters of Thunder Creek in 1892, and another rush was on. Some silver was located, but the costs of getting the ore out were too high. By 1913 most of the Thunder Creek mining companies had folded. Mining continued along the Stehekin drainage through the 1910s until metal values dropped and it became too costly. Interest in mining in the area did not resume until WWI increased the demand for metal and then again during the 1940s to 1950s for the last time. Short working seasons, unpredictable weather conditions, difficult transportation, limited accessibility and lack of working capital were all factors that hampered the development of large-scale mining in the North Cascades.</field>

		<field name="content">Due to inaccessibility, little of the park was commercially logged. Commercial timber cutting began on westside, low-elevation forests in the 1860s. Once the natural logjams that blocked the lower Skagit were cleared away in the 1870s, logging began to extend into the heart of the mountains. Logs were rafted down the river to be milled at settlements downstream. Logging also occurred in the Stehekin Valley. There were some mills in the valley that were used to mill lumber for local use. Most of the logs were rafted down Lake Chelan and used to make apple boxes. The lack of an adequate transportation system hindered early efforts to expand logging operations deep into the mountains.</field>

Fossil and rock magnetism studies indicate that the North Cascades terranes were formed thousands of miles south in the Pacific Ocean. Attached to slowly moving plates of oceanic rock, they drifted northward merging together about 90 million years ago. Colliding with the North American Continent, the drifting rock masses were thrust upwards and faulted laterally into a jumbled array of mountains. The collision broke or sliced the terranes into north or south trending faults that are still evident today.</field>

		<field name="content">Major rivers continually shape the landscape on all sides of the Cascade Crest and provide key habitat for thousands of species of plants and animals. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the North Cascades. To the north, the Chilliwack River leaves the park to combine with the Fraser River in British Columbia (the largest watershed along the west coast of North America). The Nooksack River flows west beyond Mount Baker beginning its journey near Mt. Shuksan (the parks most photographed peak). Baker River drains the Picket Range and southeast slopes of Mount Baker joining the Skagit River, which flows from Canada, then westward across the middle of North Cascades National Park Complex. The Skagit is the largest watershed emptying into Puget Sound. In spite of the three dams along its length, the Skagit supports all five species of Pacific salmon and two anadromous (or sea-going) trout. The Stehekin River drains the southeast corner of the park to feed Lake Chelan – a glacier-carved trough which at 1500 feet is the third deepest natural lake in the nation. The waters of Lake Chelan eventually make their way to the mighty Columbia River, the largest river system in the western US.</field>

Contrary to popular belief, the geography is not flat and treeless (like in the true high plains) but rather gently rolling hills covered in places by dense low trees, shrubs, and grasses. The city is roughly bisected by the North Canadian River (recently partially renamed the Oklahoma River in a flight of civic exuberance). The North Canadian is not very impressive as rivers go; it was once substantial enough to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding homes, until the 1940s when the Civilian Conservation Corps dammed the river and turned it into essentially a wide ditch for the next 50 years. In the 1990s, as part of the citywide revitalization project known as MAPS, the city built a series of low water dams, returning water to the portion of the river flows near downtown. The city also has three large lakes, Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser, in the northwestern quarter of the city, and the largest - Lake Stanley Draper, in the sparsely populated far southeast of the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Prior to the influx of European settlers, Olympics human population consisted of Native Americans, whose use of the peninsula was thought to have consisted mainly of fishing and hunting. However, recent reviews of the record, coupled with systematic archaeological surveys of the mountains (Olympic and other Northwest ranges) are pointing to much more extensive tribal use of especially the subalpine meadows than seemed formerly to be the case. Most if not all Pacific Northwest indigenous cultures were adversely affected by European diseases (often decimated) and other factors, well before ethnographers, business operations and settlers arrived in the region, so what they saw and recorded was a much-reduced native culture-base. Large numbers of cultural sites are now identified in the Olympic mountains, and important artifacts have been found.  When settlers began to appear, extractive industry in the Pacific Northwest was on the rise, particularly in regards to the harvesting of timber, which began heavily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Public dissent against logging began to take hold in the 1920s, when people got their first glimpses of the clear-cut hillsides. This period saw an explosion of peoples interest in the outdoors; with the growing use of the automobile, people took to touring previously remote places like the Olympic Peninsula.  The formal record of a proposal for a new national park on the Olympic Peninsula begins with the expeditions of well-known figures Lieutenant Joseph ONeil and Judge James Wickersham, during the 1890s. These notables met in the Olympic wilderness while exploring, and subsequently combined their political efforts to have the area placed within some protected status. Following unsuccessful efforts in the Washington State Legislature in the early 1900s, President Theodore Roosevelt created Mount Olympus National Monument in 1909, primarily to protect the subalpine calving grounds and summer range of the Roosevelt elk herds native to the Olympics.  Public desire for preservation of some of the area grew until President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared ONP a national park in 1938.</field>

		<field name="content">Linking ocean and land ecosystems, rivers and streams provide a highway for fish and other wildlife to move both up and downstream.  As fish swim upstream to spawn and later die, they bring with them vital nutrients from the sea, replenishing the forest in ways that science has only recently defined. Water defines Olympic National Park. In cloud form it delivers abundant rain and snow. As frozen glaciers it sculpts the peaks. In snow-melt rivulets it waters mountain meadows then feeds powerful rivers rushing to the sea. Alpine tarns perch on peaks and several huge lakes lie in the lowlands. These streams, rivers and lakes are a circulatory system—life-blood of the parks diversity. Mount Olympus, the parks highest peak, is in the middle of the range. Rivers radiate out from the central mountains like spokes on a wheel. On the parks west side, valleys are broad and U-shaped and rivers meander over wide floodplains. On other sides, the rivers are often constricted into narrow, steep-walled valleys. With protected headwaters, these are healthy, dynamic watersheds where natural processes like flooding, log jams, and nutrient cycling prevail.</field>

Now the park protects one of the largest remaining blocks of old growth forest and temperate rain forest in the lower 48 states.  " to preserve...the finest sample of primeval forests of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, Douglas fir, and western red-cedar in the entire United States..."  These are the forests of Olympic National Park described in the 1938 act establishing the park. Now the diverse forest communities of the park and neighboring wilderness areas in Olympic National Forest are even more significant as rare islands of habitat surrounded by altered landscapes. They form a dynamic green canvas from tree line to coast. Heavy snow, avalanches, fire, wind storms, landslides and flooding all interact to rearrange the colors or reset the clock. But the resulting forests are a vibrant, ever-changing palette of greens, textures, species and ages. Some areas nurture trees that sprouted when the Mayan culture was thriving in the jungles of central America. While youthful willows and red alders sprout and die regularly on shifting gravel bars in the parks rivers.</field>

		<field name="content">Olympic National Parks 73-mile long wilderness coast is a rare treasure in a country where much of the coastline is prime real estate. The rocky headlands, beaches, tidepools nurturing a living rainbow of colors and textures, off shore sea stacks topped by nesting seabirds and wind-sheared trees-all are a remnant of a wilder America. In fact, in 1988, Congress added much of the narrow coastal strip of the park (and much of the rest of the park) to a national system of designated wilderness. The intertidal areas, where the Pacific Ocean tides shape life, are also within the boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. The offshore islands with their colonies of nesting seabirds and rocky haulouts for seals and sea lions, lie within the Washington Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Peer into a tidepool and your view may take in hundreds of animals crowded into an area the size of a dinner plate. Cold, nutrient-rich waters upwelling from the Pacific Ocean floor feed a food chain extending from tiny invertebrates to many-ton whales. In the intertidal, that abundance is stacked in layers determined by the tides, competition and the reach of predatory neighbors. Each species tends to thrive in only a certain narrow band of habitat, rarely straying above or below.</field>

		<field name="content">Overall, the Olympic Peninsula has a moderate marine climate with pleasant summers and mild, wet winters.  The Olympic Mountains, part of North Americas western coast range, rise suddenly from near sea level to ~8000 feet, intercepting Pacific moisture which is dumped as large amounts of rain.  The climate grows wetter from east to west on the Olympic Peninsula.  Sunny days are likeliest in July and August. Nearby Sequim is actually in the rain-shadow of the Olympics and is known for sunny days and minimal rain.  Summers tend to be fair and warm, with high temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees F. July, August and September are the driest months, with heavier precipitation during the rest of the year.  While winters are mild at lower elevation, with temperatures in the 30s and 40s, snowfall can be heavy in the mountains, with accumulations of up to 10 feet common.</field>

		<field name="content">Opal Creek is one of the very few old growth forests that never allowed logging. Some of the trees are large enough to fit 15-20 children around. Walking through the ancient forest you can feel the difference between it and groomed and logged forest.  It is reported that the first people to call Opal Creek home were local Native Americans; ancient artifacts have proven their existence. In fact, there is a location near the lodges that is considered sacred ground.  The neatest part of walking the trails is seeing the old mine shafts and rusting mining equipment. Gold and other precious metals were found in the area in the mid 1900s. When the mining eventually stopped, their company turned over their land including Jawbone Flats and a piece of old growth forest to those who continue today to preserve the area.</field>

		<field name="content">Humans have inhabited present-day Oregon since about 13,000 years ago, and by the time of European exploration in the 1500s there were many established Native American tribes. The earliest explorers came by sea to the west coast of North America in search of the Northwest Passage, and later by land, but they largely ignored many areas of present-day Oregon.  Although numerous sea expeditions explored the coast of Oregon, it wasnt until 1792 when American captain Robert Gray first entered what would become known as the Columbia River, followed soon afterward by British captain George Vancouver. By land, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led an expedition across the Louisiana Purchase to the mouth of the Columbia, arriving at the Pacific Coast in 1805. An expedition financed by John Jacob Astor later established a fort at what is now Astoria.  From 1818 to 1846, the Oregon Country (which also included present-day Washington state and British Columbia) was jointly occupied by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. At that time, most settlers were involved in fur trading. A group of early American settlers eventually established a provisional government in 1843 at Champoeg. As more American settlers followed the Oregon Trail and settled in the Oregon Country, a boundary dispute with the United Kingdom was settled in the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which drew the boundary line at the 49th parallel, the present-day boundary between the United States and Canada.  The Oregon Territory was officially organized in 1848, and Oregon became a state on February 14, 1859.  In the 1880s, the transcontinental railroads greatly helped bring Oregons wheat and lumber to markets in the east, as well as further population growth in its cities. Industrial production began in the 1930s with the construction of the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River Gorge.</field>

Moisture from the Pacific Ocean meets a barrier at the Cascade Range, resulting in abundant rainfall in western Oregon during the fall, winter, and spring, and milder temperatures overall. East of the Cascades, however, the climate is semi-arid and much drier, with a wider range of temperatures during the year. Snow falls abundantly in the Cascade mountains during the winter.</field>

		<field name="content">Today, Oregon is a study in contrast and diversity. Oregon was one of the first states to give citizens the power to pass legislation via initiative and referendum. Ballot measures in the state run the gamut from very conservative to very liberal, displaying a wide variety of opinions. The Cascade mountain range forms both a geographical and cultural dividing line between west and east. West of the Cascades in the Willamette Valley, progressive opinions such as environmentalism prevail, while in eastern Oregon political thought tends to be rather conservative.  Oregon, however, has a reputation for innovation. Besides being the first state to allow initiative and referendum, it was the first state to establish a beverage container deposit law (also known as a bottle bill), the first to legalize physician-assisted suicide, one of the first to legalize medical marijuana, and the first state to conduct all elections entirely by mail.  Be aware that the name of the state is invariably pronounced "OR-uh-gun" within the state; if you pronounce it "or-ee-GONE," most residents will reflexively correct you, as they are unable to abide this particular faux pas. If you persist, be prepared to endure some awkward moments. Also, the Willamette River, the main river in Western Oregon that runs north from Eugene through Salem to Portland, is pronounced "wil-LAM-met," with the accent on the second syllable.</field>

		<field name="content">Most tourists visit Orlando between June and August, while another peak time for tourism is March and April. Ironically, the less busy times for tourism correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area; the summer months can be exceptionally busy with families who are making a trip while kids are on summer vacation. Visiting when the weather isnt so hot means less people in the area and that provides some advantages, but you will be able to enjoy cooler weather.     Many say central Florida has two seasons: hot and hotter. Orlando has warm, balmy springs and autumns; hot summers complete with daily thunderstorms; and temperate winters affected by the occasional cold front. That being said:  Spring in Orlando has highs in the 80s (27°C) in March April transitioning to around 90°F (32°C) in May and low-mid 90s in June. Spring is the driest time of year here, and in the past decade some spring months have seen less than a half-inch of rain! This is the time of year in which many small wildfires appear around the region, but this should not bother anyone who stays within the urban area. March and April are great times to visit with dry days, clear skies, and warm temperatures (and no cold fronts). However, late May and early June are arguably the worst time to visit filled with hot, humid, dry days.    Summer begins with the start of daily thunderstorms around mid-June. Highs from mid-June to mid-September are in the mid 90s, with 90ºF (32°C) often being reached by 10-11AM, and lows in the 70s (23°C). Due to Orlandos proximity to two coasts, thunderstorms form everyday during this period from ocean breezes which heat over land, rise, and cool in the atmosphere to create sometimes violent thunderstorms (see the "Stay Safe" section). However, they often will drop temperatures into the low 80s (28°C) after passing...a welcome relief from the hot temperatures earlier in the year.  Autumn varies much more from year to year than spring. The daily thunderstorms taper off in September leaving highs in the mid-high 80s (29°C) until mid-October. The first cold front of the season will usually pass between mid and late October, plunging highs into the 70s (24°C) and lows into the 50s (12°C) and high 40s (10°C). The cooling trend continues into November and December, with highs falling into the 70s (24°C) by late December and lows into the 50s (12°C), affected only by the occasional cold front which can plunge highs into the 60s (18°C)(Nov) and 50s (12°C)(Dec) and lows into the 40s (7°C)(Nov) and as low as freezing (32ºF/0ºC) by mid December.  Winter is much the same as November and December. Highs are in the 70s (24°C), lows in the 50s (12°C), affected every week or two by cold fronts. Following a cold front, highs can drop into the 50s (12°C), lows into the 30s (2°C). Sub-freezing mornings typically occur two or three times a year.</field>

		<field name="content">Unlike other areas of Western New York, there were very fewmdash;if anymdash;permanent Native American settlements in this region.  Certainly they used the high Ridge (now State Route 104) as a major transportation route, and they hunted and fished here, but the swampy land led to illness for anyone who tried to settle down.  Early European settlers also stayed away until well after other areas like  Canandaigua  and  Batavia  were prosperous and thriving.  In 1796, the area was included in the Holland Purchase, an enormous swath of land encompassing the every part of the state west of the Genesee River.  The land office in Batavia sold off parcels throughout the Purchase, which became known as  Genesee County .  The other counties of Western New York were split off from Genesee in turn, with Orleans being the second-to-last in 1824.  The major impetus for the settlement of the area north of the Oak Orchard Swamp was the construction of the Erie Canal.  The westernmost stretch of the canal opened in 1825, and that opened up eastern markets for the products of Orleans County farms.  Only a few years later, high-quality sandstone was discovered to exist under the topsoil in the region, and Medina sandstone was soon being quarried and exported throughout the state.  Manufacturing has never been as important here as in neighboring counties, due to the low population and lack of readily available power.  Instead, farming remains the countys major industry.</field>

		<field name="content">The years 1565 to 1763 marked the period of Spanish occupation in Florida. Spanish activities during this time centered primarily in North Florida included the development of the mission system and establishing trade with the native Floridians. The Native Americans living in the area were the Northern Utina, a Timucuan tribe.  During the twenty-year British occupation, 1763-1783, the Osceola was included in the “land claimed by the Creek Indians.” It was not until after the Revolutionary War that individuals began to settle in the Forest establishing an agricultural based economy. Less than ten years after Florida’s entrance into the United States (1845) there were 14 sawmills around Jacksonville receiving timber harvested from the Forest.  The Battle of Ocean Pond (Olustee), fought in 1864, took placed within the Forest on the Olustee Battlefield Historic Site. During this encounter Union soldiers attempted unsuccessfully to cut off major railroad supply lines to confederate troops.  The Osceola was proclaimed a National Forest by Presidential Proclamation on July 10, 1931 and is one of 154 National Forests managed by the USDA Forest Service for the benefit of the American public.  This new “forest” had been cutover and heavily burned. A management plan was developed that focused on establishing new growth through reforestation. Fire controls were implemented to ensure the survival of the young trees. During the 1940’s a new concept, prescribed burning, was developed and managed fires began to be used to reduce the fuels and lessen the threat of wildfire.  In the 1960’s, management in the USDA Forest Service National Forests was expanded from managing primarily for timber production to include managing for range, water, recreation and wildlife, with an emphasis on the “multiple use” of forest resources. Wise stewardship has left the Osceola National Forest with an abundance of natural and cultural resources. Today the forest is managed for multiple uses on an ecological basis with the mission of “Caring for the Land and Serving People.”</field>

		<field name="content">This “flatwoods” forest is a mosaic of low pine ridges separated by cypress and bay swamps. It is typical of the flatwoods country with elevations ranging from 90 to 200 feet. Visitors enjoy quiet, peaceful woodlands named in honor of the famous Seminole Indian warrior, Osceola.  Most of the Osceola has a high water table and poorly drained soil. Ground water normally fluctuates from 0-40 inches below the earth’s surface. Many intermediate swamps flow through the flatwoods.  The northern portion of the forest is characterized by Pinhook Swamp and Impassable Bay. These wetland ecosystems link the forest to the Okefenokee Swamp and form the headwaters of the Suwannee and St. Marys Rivers.  Big Gum Swamp is a 13,600-acre Wilderness Area in the north central part of the Forest. The Osceola also has a 373-acre Research Natural Area included on the register of National Natural Landmarks.</field>

		<field name="content">Vegetation on the Forest is generally divided into two types; swamps and ridges (a ridge may only be a few feet higher than a swamp.) Longleaf and slash pine, saw palmetto, gallberry, wiregrass and wax myrtle grow on the ridges. Cypress, blackgum, bay maple, ferns, mosses and briars are found in the swamps. These vegetative types provide plant species that have high value as wildlife food.  The Osceola National Forest has been known for its ability to produce high-quality timber. Remnants of old railroad grades used to move logs to sawmills crisscross the forest. Trees across the forest were tapped for resin and remnants of old turpentine camps can be found throughout the forest. The Olustee Experimental Forest was established in the 1930’s to provide research for the naval stores industry.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The area was first settled by Native Americans. Oxford was first called Hoods Crossing, after the local Hoods Tavern. The borough was later called Oxford Crossing and Oxford Village.  Oxford was located near the half-way point on the main road from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The owner of the stage between the two cities purchased Hoods Tavern and re-named it Oxford Hotel. It became the stopping point on the two-day trip between the two cities.  In 1833, Oxford was officially incorporated as a borough. Its first burgess (currently called the mayor) was Thomas Alexander, who operated a general store in which the oldest public library in Pennsylvania was located. His store is thought to be the oldest building in Oxford.  The northern half of Oxford was owned by the Dickey family in the 19th century. The Dickeys included the local Presbyterian minister, the founder of the local bank, a state Representative, and local businessmen. Reverend John Miller Dickey and his wife Sarah Emlen Cresson founded Ashmun Institute in 1854 which later became Lincoln University, PA. The family played a major role in re-routing the planned railroad connecting Philadelphia and Baltimore. Track was laid in the 1850s, and by the time of the Civil War, Oxford was a bustling community. The business district on Third Street was entirely re-built at this time, including the Oxford Hotel (1858) and Oxford Hall (1862). Oxford became known for its confectionery and candy businesses and was the location of many manufacturing facilities.  In the late 20th century, transportation changes resulted in Oxford being located off the main roads. A bypass was constructed for U.S. Route 1, but the major change was the construction of Interstate 95 - which shifted the bulk of the Philadelphia-Baltimore traffic away from Oxford.</field>

High heat indices are not uncommon for the summer months in the Palatka area. High temperatures can reach mid to high 90s with heat index ranges of 105-115 °F. The highest recorded temperature in Palatka was 105°F in 1950. It is common for daily thunderstorms to erupt during a standard summer afternoon. These are caused by the heating of the land and water, combined with extremely high humidity.  During winter, the area can experience hard freezes during the night. Such cold weather is usually short lived, as the city averages only 15 nights below freezing. The coldest temperature recorded in Palatka was 11 °F on January 21, 1985, a day that still holds the record cold for many locations in the eastern half of the US. Even rarer in Palatka than freezing temperatures is snow. When snow does fall, it usually melts before touching the ground, or upon making contact with the ground.   Palatka has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities. Palatka has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms passing through the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area. Rainfall averages around 50 inches a year, with the wettest months being June through September.</field>

The park is home to many unique geological formations, including many hoodoos-- thin, irregular columns of sedimentary rock sticking up from the canyon floor, capped with a harder rock which prevents further erosion.  The Lighthouse is the most famous of these in park, and is one of the quintessential postcard shots in the state.

		<field name="content">The St. Andrews Bay area was home to Native Americans before it was settled as a community in the 1800s. Pirates found the deep pockets of the Bay ideal to lie in wait for merchant ships in route to Mexico or Spain. Legend has it that many a pirate buried his share of treasure at Spanish Shanty Point on Shell Island.  Another area teeming with history in Panama City Beach is St Andrews State Recreation Area. During World War II, it was part of the St. Andrews Sound Military Reservation. Circular cannon platforms are still in place near the jetties. Opened in 1951, the park now covers more than 1,200 acres.  For quite some time Panama City Beach has been a popular vacation destination, especially among people in the Southern United States. The city is also a very popular spring break destination, sometimes being referred to as "The Spring Break Capital of the World," with over 500,000 college and high school students who arrive during the months of March and April.  Well-known locations in the city were places such as "The Hang-Out" at the Long Beach Resort motel and the now closed Miracle Strip Amusement Park. There has recently been a construction boom and the cityscape is now characterized by high-rise hotels and condominiums.</field>

		<field name="content">First known as the Northfields, "the Farms", and Brooksby, the area was settled about 1626 within  Salem , which had itself been founded in 1626 and incorporated in 1629. In 1752, the area was set off from Salem and incorporated as part of  Danvers . It was usually referred to as "the South Parish", associated with the church located in the center (now Peabody Square). In 1855, the community broke away from Danvers to become the town of South Danvers, incorporated that May 18. The name was changed on April 30, 1868 to Peabody after George Peabody, a noted philanthropist. It would be incorporated as a city in 1916.  Beginning as a farming community, the towns streams attracted mills which operated by water power. In particular, Peabody was a major center of New Englands leather industry and tanneries remained a linchpin of the citys economy into the second half of the 20th century. The tanneries have since closed, but the city remains known locally as the Leather City or Tanner City and its high school sports teams are nicknamed the Tanners.  The loss of the tanneries was a blow to Peabodys economy, but the city has made up for the erosion of its industrial base, at least in part, through other forms of economic development. Early in the 20th Century, it joined the automobile revolution, hosting the pioneer brass era company Corwin Manufacturing Company‎. The Northshore Mall, originally The Northshore Shopping Center, is one of the regions largest malls. It opened in 1958 and is now the citys largest taxpayer. Centennial Park, an industrial park in the center of the city, has attracted several medical and technology companies.  Meanwhile, West Peabody, which was mostly farmland as recently as the 1950s, has been developed into a middle-to-upper class residential area.  Peabody is the location of the Salem Country Club, a private country club with a professional golf course. In the past, the club has hosted The U.S. Senior Open in 2001 and the U.S. Womens Open in 1954 and 1984.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Pensacola has the nickname "The City of Five Flags."  Only the Pensacola Chamber of Commerce actually uses that name, but its a convenient short-handed way of describing the citys history.  Over the past 450 years, Pensacola has been owned by five nations: Spain, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Confederate States.  It was also inhabited by various Native American tribes, but sloganeers never seem to include them.  When the Panzacola Indians arrived in Pensacola thousands of years ago, they found old growth pine forests, thicketed with massive pine trees so large, it would take two or three men to wrap your arms around the trunk.  These trees provided so much shade that there was almost no undergrowth on the forest floor, and traveling through the woods was easy.  Since there isnt much food to be found in pine forests, the tribes tended to live near the water, where fishing was plentiful.  Not much is known about these early inhabitants of the area: they left few artifacts behind, and all of the tribes that lived in Pensacola prior to European colonization have gone extinct.    European colonization began with the Spanish: Juan Ponce de León (of Fountain of Youth fame) sighted the area first, and later Spanish explorers were excited by the well-protected, deep water bay.  They recommended settlement, and in 1559, Tristán de Luna y Arellano arrived at the bay and founded the first European settlement in the United States.  He named it...  Puerto de Santa Maria.  It failed miserably. He sent his men on worthless scouting missions into the desolate pine forests, lost all of his ships in a hurricane (with the supplies still on board!), and was so incapable and uninspiring that his men mutinied.  He lived, thanks to the intervention of Catholic missionaries in the town, but once Spanish ships arrived a few months later, the remaining Spaniards quickly abandoned the settlement.  Spain didnt return...  Until 1698.  They had rediscovered the bay five years earlier during a mapping expedition. Since the bay was still a tempting harbor, and there were many old growth pines at the nearby Blackwater River that would be perfect for shipbuilding, Spain decided to resettle the bay.  This time, the settlement was named Bahía Santa María de Filipina.  Still not Pensacola!  However, the name Panzacola was written on explorers maps for the area, and the name was starting to gain informal use.  The settlement was poor, small, populated mostly by prisoners, and suffered many setbacks.  It remained this way for many years, when...  In 1719, France, led by the governor of French Louisiana captured Pensacola from the Spanish at the outset of the War of the Quadruple Alliance.  There was almost no resistance from Pensacola: no one had bothered to tell the Pensacolians that they were at war!  The befuddled city greeted the French with open arms, expecting the ships from Mobile to trade supplies, not bullets.  After taking control, they didnt do much with the city.  The French burned Pensacola during their retreat in 1722, and the Spanish resumed control of the (pillaged, charred) city...  Until 1763, when Great Britain won Florida from the Spanish as a concession following the French and Indian War/Seven Years War.  In exchange, Spain was allowed to keep Cuba, and was also given Louisiana as a gift from the French, in exchange for their help during the war.  Not a bad trade.  Great Britain was proud of its new city, and they put a lot of effort into improvement.  It was declared the capital of the new colony of British West Florida, and they built most of the streets in downtown Pensacola that are still used today.  This period of British prosperity didnt last too long though, because...  In 1781, Spain recaptured Pensacola, along with the rest of Florida, as an ally of the United States in the American Revolutionary War.  Bernardo de Gálvez, the general of Spanish Louisiana, was instrumental in winning the city during the Battle of Pensacola.  When the Spanish fleet commander lost a ship and refused to send any more into Pensacola Bay, Gálvez used his powers as governor to commandeer one of the ships from Louisiana and personally sailed it into the harbor, under constant cannon fire from the British.  The other ships in the fleet soon followed, somewhat emasculated, one imagines.  With Florida now in Spanish control, Spain controlled all of the Gulf Coast, and parts of the Mississippi River, which resulted in a lot of discontent among United States settlers in the south.  They wanted water access, and their agitation for a seaport eventually inspire a young general named Andrew Jackson, who...  In 1821, finally succeeded in capturing Pensacola, and Florida, for the fourth and final time: it was now owned by the United States of America.  The Adams-Onís Treaty made the acquisition official, giving Pensacola and all of Spanish Florida to the Americans.  This was a boon for Mississippi and Alabama, which finally gained access to the sea.  It wasnt so great for General Jackson, who was made Governor of Florida, a job he hated, and later quit.  By this time, Pensacola had become the largest city in Florida, and was one of the most important ports on the Gulf Coast.  In 1845 the territory became the 27th United State.  The United States invested a lot in Florida, building forts here, increasing a military presence.  They built shipyards, which a hundred years later would become Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola.   In 1861 Florida seceded from the United States to join the Confederate States of America.  For four years, Florida fought with the South as part of the American Civil War.  Contrary to initial expectations, this war did not end well for the South.  Even worse for Pensacola, the Confederacy single-handedly destroyed the citys economy. Confederate Colonel John Beard, afraid that Union troops would capture Pensacola, ordered his men to "destroy every foot of lumber, all saw-mills, boats, etc.," along with anything else that may be of use to "the enemy."  The citys economy never fully recovered.  Pensacola rejoined the United States in 1865, beginning a long decline for the city.  The lumber industry began to rebuild, but by the 1930s, every old-growth tree in northwest Florida had been cut down, leaving nothing but small, newly-planted pines.  Pensacola Bay, the entire reason for the citys existence, was unable to accommodate modern ships, which required deeper water.  The city council declined to dredge the bay to make the water deeper, and the harbor declined to near nothingness.  Most of the shipping moved to Mobile.  Today, the military is a driving force in Pensacolas economy.  The Pensacola shipyards were re-purposed, and became the first naval air station in the United States in 1913.  NAS Pensacola is home to the Blue Angels and the National Museum of Naval Aviation.  All naval aviators are, at some point in their career, trained at NAS Pensacola.  The base employs more than 23,000 people.</field>

		<field name="content">Often described as having three-and-a-half seasons, Pensacola has a subtropical climate with short, mild winters and hot, humid summers.  Typical summer conditions have highs in the low 90s °F (32-34 °C) and lows in the mid 70s (23-24 °C).  Afternoon or evening thunderstorms are common during the summer months. Due partly to the coastal location, temperatures above 100 °F (37.8 °C) are rare, and last occurred in June 2011, when two of the first four days of the month recorded highs of over 100 °F.  In winter, expect brisk, cool, dry days.  The average high in January is 61.2 °F (16.2 °C), and the low is 42.8 °F (6.0 °C), though freezing temperatures occur on an average fifteen nights per season.  If you come from a northern climate, you can survive a Pensacola winter with nothing more than a sweater or light jacket.  Pensacolians, on the other hand, drag out the parkas when it hits fifty degrees.  Spring and fall are both mild times to visit.  The temperatures tend to stay around sixty to eighty degrees, theres less risk of tropical storms, theres less humidity, and the thunderstorms are less powerful.  Its a good time to sunbathe too, when the sun is bright but mild.    No matter what time of year you visit, you should bring an umbrella.  Pensacola is one of the rainiest places east of the Mississippi, and there is no dry season or wet season: rain can hit at any time of the year.  The city receives 64.28 inches (1,630 mm) of precipitation per year, with a rainy season in the summer. The rainiest month is July, with 8.02 inches (204 mm), with April being the driest month at 3.89 inches (99 mm).  Spring and summer have popcorn showers, a peppy euphemism for thunderstorms that seem to exist solely to soak you unexpectedly, then disappear, leaving you to enjoy the sunshine again.   Always, when visiting Pensacola, have some plans for indoor activities, in case your outdoor plans get rained out.  There are many popular indoor activities that will keep you entertained.  June to November is known as hurricane season.  Hurricanes are powerful tropical storms with high wind speeds, rain, and coastal flooding.  They also make it really difficult to get a good tan.  While Pensacola is vulnerable to hurricanes, they dont hit every year, and most of them are pretty weak.   After nearly 70 years without a direct hit, Pensacola, Florida was hit directly by Hurricane Erin (category 2) in August 1995 and major Hurricane Ivan (category 3) in September 2004.  Hurricane Dennis brushed the area in July 2005 causing moderate damage.   Visitors will usually have plenty of notice if they keep up with the media.</field>

The monument became a national park in 1962, and legislation passed in 2004 more than doubled the parks area from 93,533 acres to 218,533 acres.  Petrified Forest National Park features one of the worlds largest and most colorful concentrations of petrified wood, the multi-hued badlands of the Chinle Formation known as the Painted Desert, historic structures, archeological sites, and displays of 225 million year old fossils.  The park is now recognized as protecting the best representation of the Late Triassic Period in the world, and on average paleontologists discover about two new animal species each year.</field>

Animal life at Petrified Forest includes amphibians, birds, insects, spiders, mammals, and reptiles. Birds, lizards and some rodents are seen most frequently, though seasons and weather play a large role in determining what animals are active.  Nocturnal animals include kangaroo rats, woodrats (also called packrats) and most other small desert rodents, skunks, foxes, bobcats, bats and owls. Animals that can be seen during the day include pronghorn, mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, desert cottontails, black-tailed jackrabbits, squirrels, hawks, snakes, lizards, golden eagles, and many songbirds.</field>

		<field name="content">Known for its role in the American Revolutionary War, Philadelphia saw the convening of the Continental Congress as well as the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Shortly after the nations inception took place in Philadelphia, the city was named the nations capital, a role it filled from 1790 until 1800, when  Washington, D.C.  took over.  Benjamin Franklin, probably the citys most famous resident, was responsible for the citys alternative title, the "new Athens." While Franklins most famous experiment dealt with the conducting of electricity, he was also responsible for the countrys first insurance company, the citys first public library and the first fire department; Franklin also played a great role in establishing the citys postal system as well as inventing new conveniences such as bifocal lenses and the Franklin Stove.  Philadelphia has seen its skyline and its name in lights throughout the years in such famous films as the "Rocky" series (the statue from "Rocky III" still stands prominently outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art), as well as films like namesake "Philadelphia" and many of Philadelphia native M. Night Shyamalans thrillers.  The Liberty Bell is right in the center of Philadelphia inside of a pavilion near Independence Hall. The Liberty Bell is a major piece in Phillys history. It was rung to announce the news of the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 in Great Britain. John Sartain in his book, Reminiscences of a Very Old Man, claims the bell was cracked during this announcement: "The final passage of the Emancipation Act by the British Parliament is linked to a bit of Philadelphia history.  On receipt of the news in Philadelphia the Liberty Bell in the tower of the State House was rung, and cracked in the ringing.  When I was up in the tower in 1830, two years after, viewing the cracked bell for the first time, Downing, who was then the custodian of Independence Hall, told me of it and remarked that the bell refused to ring for a British Act, even when the Act was a good one."</field>

In Old City, the Third Street Corridor, from 3rd and Chestnut Streets to Vine Street, is home to many locally owned businesses contributing to art, design and fashion industries. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the oldest one in America, has been in operation since 1790. In addition, the city is host to several Fortune 500 companies, including Comcast (the nations largest cable television and broadband Internet provider), CIGNA insurance, Aramark, and Lincoln Financial Group. The largest private employers in the city are the University of Pennsylvania, Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Temple University, and US Airways.  In the region there are approximately 50 higher educational institutions making Philadelphia a large college town.   Dating back to the citys roots as the nations first capital, the federals government presence is also strong in Philadelphia. A U.S. Mint is located near Philadelphias historic district and the Philadelphia division of the Federal Reserve Bank is close to that. Thanks to this governmental presence the city plays host to a large number of prestigious law firms and is considered one of the nations centers of law.  The Pennsylvania Railroad, once the largest railroad company in the world, continues to influence Philadelphias economy under the Amtrak name. Amtraks second-busiest station, 30th Street Station, is on the west bank of the Schuylkill River and employs many Philadelphians in customer service, engineering, accounting, and IT jobs at the station.  Many medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, and medical technology firms make their homes in and around Philadelphia, arguably making it the nations healthcare capital.  And numerous virtual commerce firms have made their home in the Philadelphia area, including QVC, Half.com (purchased by eBay), DuckDuckGo, Monetate, and MyWikiBiz.</field>

Average annual snowfall is 24 inches (59 cm) which is spread out mainly from December to March, but the area is sometimes hit by devastating blizzards that can dump up to half that total or even more on the city in one day, such as in 1996 when a single storm dumped 30.7 inches (78 cm) of snow on the city in just a couple days.  Spring and fall are rather pleasant, with temperatures in the 60s and 70s F (15°C-25°C). Summers are hot and humid, and conditions can get quite unpleasant when the air temperature is near 90°F (32°C) and humidity is high.</field>

		<field name="content">The name Pine Barrens partially refers to the regions sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soil, to which the crops imported by European settlers did not take well. Due to the poor agricultural conditions and the lack of natural resources, the Pine Barrens had remained largely unsettled despite the rapid growth of nearby Philadelphia and New York City. The Pine Barrens have been home to charcoal, glass, and lumber industries, but the forest has reclaimed almost all traces of the Pine Barrens industrial past. The region has become home to many cranberry bogs and blueberry farms, which thrive in acidic conditions.  In the mid-20th century, concerns about the suburbanization of the area led to the creation of the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve in 1978, the nations first National Reserve. About 1.1 million acres of the Pine Barrens are now part of the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, which includes the Wharton, Brendan T. Byrne (formerly Lebanon), and Bass River state forests.</field>

		<field name="content">The weather is definitely not one of the attractions in Pine City.  Theres a boat load of fun to be had in any season, but it is a place where the climate has to be taken into consideration.   Obscured by  Minnesota ’s ferocious winters (see  Cold weather ) are the heat waves of summer.  Many days in July and August are hot and humid. Summer nights are more comfortable, though, and youll get a few degrees respite along one of the many lakefronts — in the local parlance, thats "cooler by the lake".  But then there are those winters. The months from November to March will see very cold temperatures, with even more bitter wind chill factors. Blizzards and ice storms are a regular occurrence.  Its a city thats well-accustomed to these winters, though, so city services and public transportation are highly unlikely to shut down.   Pine City does have a few nice months of weather. May and September are pleasant and mild; April and June are mostly fine, although thunderstorms with heavy winds can also occur suddenly.  Even though there may be a chill in the air in October, it rarely calls for more than a light coat.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The initial 2,060 acres of Pinnacles National Monument was set aside in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt to preserve the unusual rock formations and the talus caves found in the park.  The Civilian Conservation Corps began developing some of the trails and facilities in the park between 1933 and 1942, including the distinctive tunnel that is found on the tunnel trail.  In 2012 the monument was elevated to national park status, and today the park has been expanded to contain 24,265 acres and attracts over 150,000 visitors annually.</field>

		<field name="content">The pinnacles for which the park is named are the remains of a 23 million year old volcano.  Located along the San Andreas fault, half of the volcano was pulled 195 miles to the northeast as the tectonic plate on which it sits shifted.  The current rocky outcroppings have been eroded to approximately one-third of the volcanos original height, but still offer a challenging vista for hikers and rock climbers.</field>

The endangered California condor, the largest flying land bird in North America, has recently been re-introduced into the park and can occasionally be seen gliding on updrafts near the rocky cliffs.  Turkey vultures are commonly seen, and the park is also home to golden eagles, prairie falcons, Cooper’s hawks, and sharp-shinned hawks.  Mammals in the park include black-tailed deer, bobcat, gray fox, raccoon, jackrabbit, brush rabbit, ground squirrel, chipmunk, and several kinds of bats.</field>

		<field name="content">The climate of Pinnacles is typical of the Mediterranean climate of California, with cool wet winters and hot dry summers. Summer temperatures of over 100°F are common, but coastal fog will often come into the valleys at night. Nighttime summer temperatures of 50°F are common, making for enormous daily temperature swings.  Winter climate is akin to the California deserts, with mild days and nights often dropping into the low 20s °F. The average precipitation is approximately 16 inches (400nbsp;mm) per year. Nearly all of the precipitation is in the form of rainfall, with the majority occurring from December to March. Snowfall is rare, but does occur in significant amounts about every 10 years.</field>

		<field name="content">Winsor Castle  Pipe Spring is a water source in the desert that has been used by humans for thousands of years, and the site of an historic cattle ranch established in 1870. Several stone buildings from the pioneer era remain, including a fortified ranch house called Winsor Castle. A new cultural museum displays Native American and pioneer exhibits. An orchard, garden, farm animals, ponds, Kaibab Paiute Indian camp and 1/2 mile trail are also on the site. It is a great place to travel in the Summer.  Winsor Castle, named after Anson P. Winsor (the first superintendent of the ranch), was built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be a tithing cattle ranch.  The reservation of the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians surrounds the national monument. Their story is told in the cultural museum.  A tour of Winsor Castle takes about a half hour. Allow a half hour to an hour to browse the cultural museum. A hike on the beautiful Rim Trail will add another 30 minutes to your visit.</field>

Unfortunately, exotic species such as Kentucky bluegrass and smooth brome also are present.  Pipestones remnant tallgrass prairies host many plants and animals that once flourished throughout the midwest. Over five hundred plant species, twenty-five fish species, forty-five macroinvertebrate species, eight reptiles and amphibians, twenty five mammal species, fifty-five families of insects (over nine hundred specimens have been collected), and approximately one hundred bird species are currently found at the Monument.  Two species listed under the Endangered Species Act are found at Pipestone National Monument: the Topeka shiner (fish) and the Western Prairie Fringed Orchid (plant).  Many people are surprised to encounter cactus in Minnesota, but the Prickly Pear Cactus is present at Pipestone National Monument, as it is in several other locations in  Southwestern Minnesota.   Other areas where one might find cactus in Minnesota include  Blue Devil Valley State Park  and  Blue Mounds State Park .  The cacti can be difficult to see in the thick grass, although under ideal conditions they have been known to reach up to 36 inches in height.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The first European to "discover" the site of Pittsburgh was French discoverer/trader Sieur de La Salle in his 1669 expedition.  The settlement of Pittsburgh began as a strategic point at the confluence of three rivers, with Britain, France, and the local Native American tribes all vying for control over this spot and thus, the region.  On what is now referred to as The Point, where the rivers meet, several forts were constructed by competing French and British forces during the French and Indian War. In 1758, British general John Forbes ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers "Pittsborough".  Manufacturing in Pittsburgh began in earnest in the early 19th century, and by the US Civil War the city was known as "the armory of the Union."  This began a sharp escalation of industry, particularly steel and glass.  By the late 19th century, Pittsburgh was known as the Steel City.  Andrew Carnegie began the Carnegie Steel Company in 1892, which became United States Steel (USS) a decade later and grew to be the largest corporation of any kind in the world.  Carnegie became the richest man on Earth and, along with other local magnates of industry, gave Pittsburgh cultural institutions such as the Carnegie Museums, Carnegie Library, and Carnegie-Mellon University.  A number of other Fortune 100 companies have called Pittsburgh their headquarters, helping fund world-class museums, theaters, universities, and other attractions.    At the height of this industrialization Pittsburgh was notorious for its severe air pollution. One journalist, James Parton, descriptively dubbed it "hell with the lid off".  White-collar workers came home in the evening as "brown-collar" workers.  When asked what to do to fix Pittsburgh, the noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright famously replied with his characteristic frankness, "Raze it."  Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance."  This much-acclaimed effort was followed by the "Renaissance II" project, begun in 1977 and focusing more on cultural and neighborhood development than its predecessor.  The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, the steel industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill closures.  Today Pittsburgh is a model of cleanliness due to the remediation of the polluting industrial plants in the late 1950s, as well as the gradual migration of the mills to other cities and countries.  There is now only one operating steel mill in the region, Carnegie Steels venerable Edgar Thompson Works, now a USS state-of-the-art integrated steel mill.  With the implosion of the steel industry in the region, the citys population shrank dramatically, from 600,000 in 1950 to 330,000 in 2000.  Remnants of the citys more prosperous past can be seen throughout the area.  But while the region is still reeling from the economic collapse, Pittsburgh is now (for the most part) economically stable, as the city has shifted the economic base to services such as education, medicine, technology, and finance.</field>

		<field name="content">The people of Pittsburgh are indeed what make it such a unique place.  The city has been shaped by its immigrants, whose specific traditions have left a lasting mark.  Pittsburghers are generally welcoming, down-to-earth, and unpretentious.  Pittsburgh has also recently gained attention as a burgeoning center for counter-culture.  The British were the first to permanently settle Pittsburgh, and early settlers included the English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish, as well as German, drawn by mining, shipping, and manufacturing.  These people formed the foundation of Pittsburgh, still physically visible in the oldest parts of the city.  By the late 1800s, the demand for labor was so strong the new immigrants - the so-called "millhunks" - began flocking to Pittsburgh, chiefly from Central and Eastern Europe.  They not only provided labor, but brought their families, their languages, their churches, and other traditions.  Today Pittsburghs identity has been strongly molded by the ethnic traditions of these immigrants from countries like Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Italy, Lithuania, Serbia, and Croatia.  Steeples and the bright copper onion-dome churches of the Eastern Orthodox tradition dot the old parts of town, and grandmas wearing babushkas are a common sight. Pittsburgh is also home to a large Jewish community, centered in  Squirrel Hill .  Pittsburghs modern economy has brought new immigrants from places such as India and China, along with their traditions; the Pittsburgh region today is home to a number of Hindu temples, for example.  Pittsburgh has truly been a great melting pot, and continues to be as a home to thousands of students from across the world that attend the many universities in the city, especially Carnegie Mellon University and the  University of Pittsburgh . In addition, Pittsburgh has an organized LGBT community and anti-discrimination laws inclusive of LGBT people have been enacted at both the city and county levels.</field>

		<field name="content">The surrounding landscape has had a huge impact on Pittsburgh; Pittsburghs characteristic rivers and hills have shaped the city physically, economically, and socially.    Like most older cities, it was the rivers that made the city.  The rivers allowed for the transport of raw materials and provided water used for making steel, and allowed for easy shipping of finished products.  Today, the rivers attract mostly recreational boaters, but still support extensive barge traffic.  Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any city in the world (only counting bridges over 20 feet, 440 or so within Pittsburgh, and over 1700 in the county).  The hilly landscapemdash;arguably the most rugged of any city east of the Rockiesmdash;has created unique neighborhoods; flat lands near the rivers were used for mills, while workers houses cling precariously to the hillsides above.  In many places "pockets" of neighborhoods, divided by rivers and valleys, have developed distinctly different characteristics from each other, despite being very close together.  Much of the landscape, with its many unbuildable slopes, remains lush and green, and provides for amazing views.</field>

It is less populated than Plaquemines West Bank. Highway 39 follows the River down the Eastbank; it connects to St. Bernard Highway (46) in St. Bernard Parish.  Note that the gas station at Scarsdale, at the intersection of 39 3137 across from the ferry to Belle Chasse, is the last chance for gas going down river on this bank.   A number of small communities line the road.  A few old plantation houses dot the route, of more modest size than the grand mansions up river; some are immaculately restored, others in states of ruin.   At the town of Phoenix the road splits. Highway 15 runs by the River and 39 continues parallel further back. 15 is the slower more scenic route.  Near the end of the road is Pointe à la Hache, still officially the Parish Seat, but as of Spring 2012 little is there other than the ruins of of the old Courthouse and an open convenience store/sandwich shop.  A ferry boat crosses the river here to West Pointe à la Hache, the furthest south vehicle crossing of the Mississippi River.</field>

Sheridan County has a most interesting history (part wild west with the old-time outlaws using the famous Outlaw Trail to evade the law and part political excitement as the Communists tried to get a foothold on the citizenship here during the early thirties while the Great Depression was in full swing.)  The Outlaw Trail started at the Outlaw Caves in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, and wound its way south through Sheridan County and as far south as Wyoming and beyond. The trail was in heavy use during Sheridan Countys early days. Romantic stories abound concerning these famous outlaws who stole cattle and horses and occasionally robbed a bank or two, escaping and evading the law via the Outlaw Trail.  The Communist Era was another colorful historic time for the County. The Communists moved in and labored long and hard to convert the citizens to their political ways. They infiltrated the county government, had their own newspaper, and provide todays interesting tales of their struggles during their rise and fall.  The Oil Boom of the 70s and early 80s also added a robust flavor to life in Sheridan County. As the population in the county more than doubled, the "live fast - work hard" lifestyle became commonplace as poker chips from local saloons were treated as legal tender almost anywhere in the county.   There is something unique and special in small-town living. Everyone in Sheridan County can assure you of that! We welcome all to come and explore our little corner of the Big Sky.</field>

Headlands and beaches on the Pacific Coast are subjected to frequent heavy fogs, most commonly during July, August and September. Sunshine and higher temperatures occur inland. The east side of Inverness Ridge and the beaches of Tomales Bay are sheltered from the summit of the ridge westward to the ocean, leaving sunny areas for picnicking and swimming. Inland temperatures in the summer are often 20 degrees warmer than temperatures on the Headlands and outer coast. The rainy season is December through March. Dressing in layered clothing is recommended.</field>

		<field name="content">Like most of Florida, summers are hot and humid with scattered thunderstorms each afternoon and winters are mild, punctuated by the occasional cold front bringing rain and colder, drier air. Between early May and late September, daytime highs run over 90°F (32°C) but rarely above 96-97°F (36°C). Nighttime lows during this period are in the mid-70s (°F; around 24°C). The rainy season runs from early-mid June through mid-late September. The humid air heats up, rises and condenses into thunderstorms, which are experienced just about every afternoon during the rainy season. These thunderstorms can sometimes be severe, producing high wind gusts, hail, and occasionally a weak tornado (most are E.F.0 or E.F.1). Lightning is the biggest hazard from these storms and is a major concern when planning outdoor activities.   Winters are mild, with highs averaging around 70°F (21°C) and lows in the low 50s (°F; 10-12°C). Temperatures above 80°F (26°C) are possible. Cold fronts every 10-14 days will typically bring some rain to mark their passing followed by cooler weather for a few days. Temperatures following a cold front can drop into the 50s 60s (°F; 10-20°C) and lows into the 30s 40s (°F; 0-10°C). Only a couple nights each year will reach freezing or below (Davenport with 90-115nbsp;mph (150-185nbsp;km/h) winds! However, for perspective, these were the first hurricanes since 1960 to pass through the county.   In drier years, spring (until the rainy season begins) is wildfire season. Fog can be an occasional issue in winter months, especially in the Green Swamp area of north-central Polk County, which includes Interstate 4 between Polk City Davenport.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The first European contact in the area came from none other than Lewis and Clark, who sailed along the Columbia River just north of where Portland lies today in 1805; after a year of exploration they finally reached the Pacific Ocean just to the west. The reports from their expedition fueled interest in the area, and settlers came to stake their claim. Two of those settlers were William Overton and his friend Asa Lovejoy, a lawyer from Boston, who came across the spot where Portland now sits and jointly began to build a settlement. Later, Overton sold his share to F. W. Pettygrove, a man from  Portland, Maine . As of this point, the area was being transformed from a small stopping point between  Oregon City  and  Vancouver, Washington  to a formal settlement, and the owners now needed to give it a name. Both Lovejoy and Pettygrove wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns; so in 1845 they decided to leave it up to a coin toss and Pettygrove won two times out of three.  In 1851, Portland was formally incorporated and was growing rapidly; its proximity to the rivers, which funneled a trade with San Francisco to the south, combined by the local fishing, lumber, and agriculture industries fueled Portlands early growth. The railroad arrived in the 1880s, and for a time Portland was the largest city on the west coast north of San Francisco; however the Klondike Gold Rush and the arrival of the railroad to Washington state meant Seattle quickly eclipsed Portlands growth.  Portland persisted as a booming railroad, lumber and steel town for several decades. During the 1970s, however, Portland began to gain a reputation for progressive urban planning practices, adopting policies such as an urban growth boundary and constructing new parks in a push to maintain the central neighborhoods as active places in light of suburban development. Through the 70s and into the 80s, Portland became a center for "counter-culture," growing into a hub for punk and indie rock music, zine publishing, and activist movements. The dot-com boom of the 90s brought an influx of modern tech companies along with the so-called "creative class", who remained even after the economic bubble burst. By this point, the citys progressive policies and politics had won the city a special status among urban designers, environmentalists, and political activists as a very forward-thinking city, which has only fueled further growth and development of the metropolitan area.</field>

		<field name="content">Its said that there are only two seasons in the Portland area: rain and summer. When the summer comes, the clouds suddenly clear and its hot and sunny, and often quite pleasant. Any given day in July through September has only a 10% chance of rain, and temperatures rarely exceed 85°F (29°C) degrees or so, although it does occasionally hit 100°F (38°C) in July and August.  Despite the nice summers, Portland is really known for its rain, which comes between late September and late June. It is more often a menacing drizzle or mist than a downpour, though. Theres a myth that most Portlanders dont use, or even believe in, umbrellas, and instead prefer hoods and raincoats. This has a grain of truth to it, but any stroll through Portland on a rainy day will prove to you that people are not shy about using umbrellas. You shouldnt be shy, either mdash; if its not summer and you dont want to get wet, pack your umbrella.  Snow is very uncommon because Portlands elevation is fairly low. A sunny day in the rainy season is not typical, but the sun does come out occasionally. The moment it does, some Portlanders have the unusual habit of wearing summer clothing, even if its still somewhat chilly.</field>

		<field name="content">River walk along Waterplace Park  Puritan refugee and Massachusetts exile Roger Williams settled Providence, Rhode Island, in June of 1636. It soon  became one of the thirteen original colonies of the United States. The Narragansett Native Americans previously occupied Rhode Islands land.   British taxation held back the city’s economical growth in its fishing, farming and nautical enterprises. Providence joined the allegiance against the British Crown and opposed the Sugar Act, a taxation that negatively affected Providence’s international rum trade. The famous Gaspee Affair of 1772 involved the residents of Providence leading the first violent attack of the American Revolution.  After the war, Providence’s economic industry changed from maritime activities to manufacturing, especially in jewelry and textiles.  Such industries drew many immigrants from Western Europe, like Italy, Ireland, England, Portugal and Cape Verde of Africa, all of which greatly contribute to the demographic populations of the state today.  The jewelry industry boomed in the 1920s. The Great Depression hit hard economically, leading to population decreases as a result of the decline of nationwide trends. Organized crime rose to the forefront in Providence in the 1950s through the 1980s, primarily situated in Providences Federal Hill neighborhood. Providence became a notorious mob scene led by mafia boss Raymond L. S. Patriarca.   The “Renaissance City” got its nickname in the 1990s when Mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr came into his second term. After investing millions local and national funds throughout the city in the 1970s, falling populations became stabilized. Cianci pushed for an emphasis on the city’s strength in the arts and entertainment and revitalized the city’s natural landscape. He brought Rhode Island the Providence Bruins hockey team, uncovered Providence’s rivers, relocated a large section of the railroad underground, created the now famous Waterplace Park and river walks, and sanctioned the construction of the Bank of America Skating Rink and gigantic Providence Place Mall.  Providence has a long history of political corruption that some feel to be part of the local charm. In keeping with this tradition; Mayor Cianci was indited not once but twice from local office. When running for office for his second term, he actually ran partly from jail. It wasnt until a 2001 racketeering case was brought against Cianci that the notorious Mayors reign ended.   The current Mayor of Providence is Angel Taveras who has made strides to end the coffer draining in the capitol. However, on February 25, 2011, Mayor Taveras sent termination notices to every teacher in the Providence public school system, setting off a wave of anxiety and anger in the Rhode Island city and prompting a union leader to accuse the mayor of anti-union maneuvering.  The teachers remained at work as the school year continued, though the notices sent out as a means of letting them know that any of them could lose their jobs at municipal officials discretion. During a packed and at-times spirited meeting  later that week, the city school committee voted 4-3 to back Mayor Angel Taveras move to send out the notices.  The mayor said in an online message that he authorized the previous days decision to dismiss almost 2,000 teachers and staff to allow for greater flexibility as the budget process unfolds. Taveras said officials will determine the final number of layoffs -- as well as exactly which teachers in which schools might lose their jobs -- needed to balance a multimillion-dollar budget gap.  "It gives us more flexibility to recall teachers based on student need," said Christina OReilly, a spokeswoman for the district.  That explanation did little to assuage teachers in the firing line, nor did a closed-door forum later that week with Superintendent Tom Brady on the matter.</field>

Unlike other inland states in New England, Rhode Islands position along the Atlantic coast keeps Providences temperatures relatively warm. Precipitation is a mainstay in Providences climate. Spring and summer months often have bouts of rainfall and winter months are regularly hit with snowfall and blizzards. Providences position on the coast of the Narragansett Bay leaves the city susceptible to hurricanes, but such occurrences are rare.</field>

But perhaps above all, Southeast Asians - from the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand - are a striking presence among the purveyors and clientele of its various shops and restaurants. Only about a 35-minute subway ride from Manhattan and a short walk from all the Indian and Latino clubs, shops, and restaurants in Jackson Heights, it is a neighborhood very much worth visiting for some excellent, inexpensive food. Very good restaurants such as the Georgia Diner are located in the district, as well as the Queens Center Mall. Get here by taking the R or M trains to Elmhurst Avenue or Grand Avenue.   Corona borders Jackson Heights to the east, across Junction Boulevard.  It is a largely Latino neighborhood with many Latino restaurants. Corona also has a rich African American heritage, and is the former home of Louis Armstrong, whose house is now a museum, and Willie Mays. Get there by taking the 7 train to Junction Boulevard or 103rd Street, or the R or M trains to Woodhaven Boulevard or 63rd Drive.</field>

		<field name="content">American Indians made their homes in the redwood forests for thousands of years before the arrival of Euro-Americans. They made their homes from split redwood planks and had considerable resources in the rich forests.  Demand for lumber accelerated throughout the years. Conservation efforts started in the early 1900s, but were largely ineffectual. By the 1960s, logging had consumed nearly 90 percent of all the original redwoods. It wasn’t until 1968 that Redwood National Park was established, which secured some of the few remaining stands of uncut redwoods. In 1978, Congress added more land that included logged-over portions of Redwood Creek. Today, these lands are undergoing large-scale restoration by the Parks resource managers. Logging continues on privately-held lands nearby and throughout the redwood region.</field>

		<field name="content">The North Coast region, which includes RNSP and the adjacent offshore area, is the most seismically active region in the United States. As a result of frequent earthquakes, rapid uplift rates have led to landslides, actively braiding and shifting rivers, and rapid coastal erosion.  Three tectonic plates (thin pieces of the Earths crust which float above the mantle), the North American, Pacific, and Gorda, contact each other at the Mendocino triple junction.  This junction lies offshore near Cape Mendocino, which is about 100 miles (160nbsp;km) southwest of RNSP.  Each of these plates slide against each other as they slowly move in opposing directions. Movement may be as much as two or three inches (5–6nbsp;cm) a year. In the 1990s, at least nine magnitude 6.0-plus earthquakes jolted the North Coast, more than in any other decade within the last century. Because the Gorda plate is subducting beneath the North American plate, there is the possibility of a "great earthquake" occurring in the future.  The three large river systems within the park — the Smith River, the Klamath River, and Redwood Creek — have cut deep gorges through the forest and mountainous terrain.  Though there are no natural ponds or lakes in the parks, there are lagoons and marshes, results of oceanic and tectonic processes. Also within the parks boundaries are the estuaries at the mouths of the Klamath River and Redwood Creek. Salmon and steelhead populations were severely diminished by erosion due to past logging activities.  The parks coastline is home to rugged cliffs where salt-tolerant vegetation springs up among the beaches and rock faces that dominate this stretch of Californias North Coast. Among the seastacks, brown pelicans and seals find a comfortable home; crabs and colorful anemones crowd the tidepools along the seas edge.</field>

		<field name="content">The Coastal Redwoods are the worlds tallest trees, exceeding 300 feet (100 meters) in height, and so, of course are the stars. Sitka Spruce and Douglas Fir trees also abound. Various other hardy plants survive in the narrow zone where land meets sea, salt-laden winds, cold fog-shrouded days, steep slopes, and sandy beaches conspire against plants. Further inland a greater range of hardwoods and shrubs are found.  The diverse ecosystems mean that creatures as different as black bears, sea stars, and bald eagles can be seen by the fortunate visitor in a single day. In addition to the more common inhabitants, many threatened and endangered species rely on the parks old-growth forests, open prairies, estuaries, and the coastline for crucial havens of survival. Threatened and endangered species found in the park include: Bald Eagle, Brown Pelican, Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Marbled Murrelet, Northern Spotted Owl, Steelhead Trout, Stellers Sea Lion, Tidewater Goby, and Western Snowy Plover.  Marine mammals such as sea lions and gray whales are among the most visible wildlife in the park. Visitors are also likely to see Roosevelt elk browsing in the prairies. Pelicans, ospreys, and gulls are frequently spotted along the coast. Tidepool creatures such as anemones and crabs are easy to spot too.</field>

		<field name="content">Temperatures range from 40 to 60 degrees(F) (4 to 15 degrees C) year round along the redwood coastline. Redwoods rely on the fog that envelops the coast in the summer and supplies up to 25% of the precipitation.  Summers are mild at the coast with warmer temperatures inland, but the aforementioned fog can be a problem, often thick as pea soup and lasting for days to weeks. Early to middle spring and early autumn are a safer bet for sunny days.  Winters are cool with considerable precipitation. Pack your rain gear and good walking shoes for the slippery rain forest. Wear layers to accommodate cool to warm temperatures.</field>

Cameron and Willacy counties are part of the Gulf Coast geographic region of Texas, whereas Hidalgo and Starr counties are part of the South Texas Plains region.  The terrain is mostly flat, although there are some hills in the western part of the RGV in Starr county.    Everyone knows Texas is big.  However, one does not truly appreciate its size until one takes a Texas road trip.  Texas is about 800 miles north-south and about 800 miles east-west depending on your route. A 10 hour drive from the RGV will take you to  Mexico City , Mexico or to  Dallas , Texas. Although the RGV is only four of Texas 254 counties, the Valley is comparable in size to the US state of  Connecticut .</field>

		<field name="content">The first Spanish settlers arrived in the Valley during the 1740s.  Jose de Escandon was commissioned by the Spanish government to establish settlements in the area.  At that time the RGV was part of the Spanish colony of Neuvo Santander.  After Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821 the RGV was part of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.  In 1836 Texas won its independence from Mexico, and the RGV was disputed territory between Mexico and Texas.  Texas claimed that the border with Mexico was at the Rio Grande River, whereas Mexico claimed that the border was at the Nueces River about 200 miles to the north.  The dispute was finally resolved in 1848 at the end of the US - Mexican War.  The first battles of the US - Mexican War were fought in the RGV in the Brownsville area.    Many Mexican American families in The Valley can trace their ancestry to the first Spanish settlers that arrived in the 1740s.  As a result a frequent expression they like to say is "we didnt jump the border, the border jumped us."  During Spanish and Mexican times the RGV was mostly ranch land.  Large numbers of Anglos immigrated to the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Those settlers were large scale farmers who established citrus farming in the region.  Since the 1980s the RGV has witnessed an explosive population growth that continues to this day.  Agriculture continues to be important to the economy, but trade with Mexico, and tourism are becoming increasingly important.</field>

		<field name="title">Rochester (New York)</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Rochester has always been defined by water.  It was born in the early nineteenth century as a small village on the Genesee River, a few miles south of Lake Ontario.  The village was constructed around flour mills that took advantage of the three waterfalls on the river for power.  When the Erie Canal was built a few years later, it was routed through Rochester, and the small village became Americas first boomtown, a major trade center for grain being shipped east and goods being shipped west.  It soon garnered the nickname "The Flour City", and its products were known as far away as England.  As time went on, and farmland opened up in the Great Plains, Rochesters flour industry faded, to be replaced by a variety of others, including clothing, shoes, boats, and horticulture.  By the middle of the nineteenth century, Rochesters nurseries and gardens had led to a new nickname: "The Flower City", celebrated each year with the famous Lilac Festival each May.  Rochester also became a center for social progressivism.  The great abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass made his home here for many years, and suffragist Susan B. Anthony was a life-long resident.  In the early 1900s, the modern city began to take shape, molded in large part by the philanthropy of George Eastman, whose Eastman Kodak camera company became the areas largest employer.  The Eastman School of Music, the Eastman Theatre, the George Eastman House, and numerous other buildings and institutions remain today as testaments to his influence and generosity.  Since World War II, Rochester has seen a decline in population but has also seen periods of urban renewal funded by industry.  In the 60s and 70s, the city became known as the leading jazz town in upstate New York, a legacy recalled today by the annual Rochester International Jazz Festival in June.  Since the turn of the century, Rochester has called itself "The Worlds Image Centre", based on the local prominence of imaging giants Kodak and Xerox and optics company Bausch Lomb.  Rochesters recent industrial decline has been painful, but it has been countered by a rise in world-class historical and cultural attractions.</field>

		<field name="content">Rochester is unashamedly part of the Snow Belt of the United States, competing every year with its upstate neighbors for the "coveted" Golden Snowball Award (for most snowfall).  Snowfalls in Rochester were once legendary, although lately the lake-effect snow has favored  Syracuse  and Rochester has started to fall behind.  Visitors are often surprised by the amount of snow Rochesterians will put up with.  It takes multiple feet of snow or biting cold frostbite-in-ten-minutes temperatures to close schools; anything less and you just put another layer on and grab the shovel.  And forget about work or college being canceled; unless the governor has declared a state of emergency, youll find commuters dutifully plunging forth across barely-plowed roads and highways.  And sometimes, even then...  Simply stated, snow is a daily fact of life in Rochester winters, and the traveler must be prepared to deal with it as the locals do: with a hearty grumble of resignation, the assertion that "at least we dont have earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes", and the knowledge that better days lie ahead.    Fortunately, those "better days" are truly gems, and few cities appreciate them more when they arrive.  "The weather is beautiful" headlines can often be found in the news media when a wave of pleasant weather hits.  July and August can be very humid at times, but relief is rarely more than a few days away.  May, June, late August, September, and early October have the most comfortable temperatures.  Outside of those months, partly sunny days alternate with overcast conditions and heavy precipitation, ranging from light fluffy snow to heavy wet glop to cold damp drizzle.  But all this emphasis on winter should not overshadow Rochesters short but beautiful springs, mild summers, and very colorful autumns.  Rochesterians make the best of winter, but they really take advantage of every nice day the rest of the yearmdash;and so should you.</field>

		<field name="content">Evidence of Native American peoples visiting the park date back almost 10,000 years, mainly from the Ute and Arapaho communities. Several expeditions visited the area in the early to mid 19th century, including one by Joel Estes in 1859 after which he and his family established a homestead that would soon become  Estes Park , the resort town that currently sits on the east side of the park. After a small mining rush on the western side of the park in the early 1880s, a 14 year old boy by the name of Enos Mills moved to the area and began to extensively document the regions geography and ecology through essays and books. He began to lobby Congress to establish a national park in the area surrounding Longs Peak, a mountain he had climbed over 40 times by himself. On January 26, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill that established the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park. The 1930s brought a building boom to the park during the Great Depression, during which time the Trail Ridge Road was constructed through the park, which remains today the highest continuous stretch of highway in the United States.</field>

		<field name="content">A Clarks Nutcracker at Rainbow Curve.   Rocky Mountain National Park sits on the Continental Divide, separating the park into two distinct regions. The eastern and more developed side of the park is dominated by striking valleys and cirques that were formed through heavy glaciation and is a good starting point for first-time visitors. The western side of the park is wetter, is heavily forested and is less developed, but still contains excellent trekking and backcountry opportunities. Most areas of the park sit well above 9,000 feet with mountains along the Continental Divide topping off at above 12,000 feet. The 13,000 foot Mummy Range rests on the northern side of Rocky Mountain National Park with two roads skirting long its southern edges; a one-way, dirt road that winds up the Fall River called the Old Fall River Road; and a section of Highway 34 famously known as the Trail Ridge Road. The Never Summer Mountains sit on the western side of the park and consist of 10 distinct peaks, all rising well over 12,000 feet, and contain the headwaters for the Colorado River. One of the most dominating features in the southeast area of the park is Longs Peak at 14,259 feet, which is surrounded on all sides by several peaks well about 13,000 feet, including Mt. Meeker, Mount Lady Washington, and Storm Peak.</field>

		<field name="content">For wildlife seekers, Rocky Mountain National Park offers some fantastic opportunities to view the variety of animals that live inside its borders. Elk, deer, chipmunks, ground squirrels, beavers, porcupines, foxes, and coyotes are all commonly seen in meadows and in and around lakes and streams. Marmots seem to be ubiquitous above the tree line, especially on well-hiked trails around Longs Peak. Hawks and eagles are often seen soaring above the glacier gorges in search of critters that hide among the rocks and colorful tree birds such as blue jays and cardinals fly in the lower altitudes. Hummingbirds have a tendency to fly close to where people - and their food - are sitting. Less common animal sightings include black bears and the rare mountain lions, although the former will manage to hang out if human food is accessible. Moose mainly stay on the western side of the park and Bighorn Sheep - a rare but exciting find - stay above the tree line and can sometimes be seen off the Trail Ridge Road.  Wildflowers seem to be everywhere throughout the park, including the popular Indian Paintbrush and Columbine, Colorados state flower. One of the most spectacular sights in the mid to late fall is to walk through a grove of Aspen trees as their leaves change from green to gold. Ponderosa and Lodgepole pines are the dominate conifer trees in the area, although they have been recently dying in large numbers due to an outbreak of pine beetle infestation.</field>

Elevations range from 8,000 feet to 12,183 feet (2,400 to 3,700 m). There are 60 miles (97nbsp;km) of hard-surfaced road with a five to seven percent grade. Most of the roads in the park have little to no shoulder, with the added challenge of dealing with heavy summer traffic. Early mornings or late evening rides may minimize conflict with other vehicles. Be vigilant for thunderstorms in the early to late afternoons, where lightning can create a serious hazard.  Winter cyclists will have access to Upper Beaver Meadows Road, Moraine Park Campground, Endovalley Road, Aspenglen Campground and High Drive. For a unique cycling experience, check with the park information office for specifics on the Old Fall River Road (gravel surface) and Trail Ridge Road (paved), which are open to bicycles early in the summer season, before they open to vehicles.  Off-road mountain biking is prohibited inside the park.</field>

Inhabited during all Prehistoric time periods (Paleo, Archaic, Woodland and Mississippian), Russell Caves artifacts represent nearly every culture inhabiting the region for over 10,000 years.  Russell Cave National Monument gets its name from Thomas Russell and his family. They owned the property when the area was mapped between 1835 and 1928.  Russell Cave became a National Monument on May 11, 1961. The National Geographic Society donated 310 acres to the American people because of the great archaeological discoveries there."</field>

		<field name="content">Sacramento has a Mediterranean-type climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Being further inland than most of the other major California cities, Sacramento is subject to more temperature variation. Winter high temperatures are commonly in the 40s and 50s Fahrenheit (10-20C), and at night the temperature drops below freezing every so often. The summer heat can be intense, with temperatures exceeding 100F (37.7) not unusual. Generally speaking, the warmer it gets, the drier it gets, so even the most intense Sacramento heat is easily alleviated by a quick dip in the swimming pool.  Sacramentos hot, dry summers are mitigated by a phenomenon locals call "the delta breeze." Heat waves rarely last more than three to five days, because as hot air builds over Californias interior valleys, cold ocean air is sucked inland through the Sacramento river delta, acting as natural air conditioning and dropping the temperature sharply. The delta breeze tends to hit the westernmost areas of Sacramento late in the afternoon and travel east/northeast at ten to fifteen miles per hour, so the hour at which your neighborhood cools depends on your proximity to the river delta or how far west/south you reside.  Most rain falls in the from around fall to mid spring and occasionally early summer. Generally speaking, however, you can count on sunny days from the middle of April until at least the middle of October. Winter is known not only for its rain but also its dense fog, which can hamper driving conditions and reduce visibility to 100 feet (30 m) at times. Snow is rare, but once every 5-10 years a light dusting occurs, and even some light accumulation away from the city. In the foothills not far east of the city, snow is much more common, and the Tahoe-area ski resorts are within easy reach of the Sacramento metropolitan area. Sacramentos location in the heart of Californias agricultural interior gives it a blossom-laden spring as a profusion of fruit trees bloom and flower filled grassland. It also experiences a "foliage fall" -- autumn color without the severe weather that accompanies brilliant color in other parts of the nation.  Severe weather is rare in Sacramento, with the primary concern being heat in summer and local flooding in winter. Occasional summer thunderstorms and even tornadoes can occur, but they are extremely rare. Sacramento is not in a known earthquake zone.</field>

		<field name="content">The parks namesake, the massive saguaro can live as long as 200 years, growing over fifty feet tall and weighing more than ten tons.  The saguaro has become an icon of the desert, with its distinctive tall trunk and numerous curved arms that branch upward.  The saguaro survives in the hot, dry desert through a series of adaptations, including a folded skin that can expand or contract depending on the amount of water collected.   In addition, the lack of leaves and the plants waxy skin reduces evaporation losses.  Unlike most plants cacti perform photosynthesis in their trunk.  The saguaros root system usually lies within three inches of the ground surface and spreads out in a circle roughly as wide as the plants height, allowing the cactus to collect any rainwater that may fall nearby.  Other species of cactus in the park include the wide barrel cactus, the spiny fishhook and cholla cacti, and the oddly-constructed prickly pear cactus.  Various bushes, including creosote and mesquite, as well as numerous desert wildflowers, fill the desert with flowers after rains.  Most animals in the desert are difficult to spot due to their nocturnal habits or camouflage, but keen-eyed visitors might find quail, roadrunners, woodpeckers, flickers, wrens, owls, hawks, desert tortoise, gila monsters, javelinas (wild pigs), kangaroo rats, coyotes, foxes, and jackrabbits.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">background</field>
		<field name="content">Kenilworth Plantation House (originally Bienvenu), in St. Bernards Terre aux Boeufs region, dates back to the 1750s.   The main roots of St. Bernard go back to the French and Spanish colonial era; the majority of the population still have Spanish or French family names.  One notable ethnic group is the Isleño population; a large group of people from the Spanish Canary Islands, known as "Isleños", settled in the Parish in the second half of the 1700s.  While Louisiana passed to the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Isleño Spanish dialect was still common to hear in some smaller towns and rural areas well into the 20th century.  While some locals keep the traditional Isleño songs and folklore alive, English is now universally understood here -- though locals may speak it with an accent unlike that usually found in the U.S.s deep south.   In 1927 the Mississippi River was at historically high levels, and burst its banks many places further up river. The city of New Orleanss levees were right at the edge of being overtopped.  A group of New Orleans bankers hatched a plan to blow up a levee in St. Bernard in order to relieve pressure on the levees of New Orleans.  This was done, flooding much of the Parish.  The New Orleans bankers had promised generous compensation for the people of St. Bernard beforehand, but delivered very little (many people affected got nothing at all).  Local resentment of New Orleans continued for generations.  In 1965, much of the Parish was flooded when Hurricane Betsy hit Louisiana. Many locals blamed much of the flooding on a then new navigation canal, the Mississippi River – Gulf Outlet Canal or MRGO, commonly called "Mister Go", which they said funneled in storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico right into the populated area, acting as a "Hurricane Highway". The Army Corps of Engineers denied the MRGO had any link to the flooding.  In 2005, during Hurricane Katrina, walls of floodwaters several meters high crashed through the entire Parish, flooding on a scope that dwarfed previous disasters.   A series of independent investigations afterwards eventually made clear that the Parish locals had been right all along: MRGO indeed served as a "superhighway for storm surge", making MRGO, along with a series of badly misdesigned levees, the cause of most of the flooding in Greater New Orleans in 2005.  The MRGO Canal was deactivated, and a barrier closing it off completed in 2009.  A system of much improved levees and floodwalls is nearing completion. However the environmental damage that had already been caused by the engineering mistake of MRGO is estimated to be in the many billions of dollars range, and there is at present no plan nor suggested funding to repair it.  As fishing has long been an important industry here, the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010 dealt another blow to the Parish.  St. Bernard Parish, despite the problems, is resilient. While the population is only about half what it was in 2005, those who are back here are working hard to rebuild the home that they love.</field>

		<field name="name">geography</field>
		<field name="content">View of the Salt Lake Valleys grid system looking from north to south  When traveling to the city, knowledge of Salt Lakes famous grid system is a big plus. The entire valley lies on the same grid system. Most major streets are laid out precisely running north-south or east-west. The origin of the grid is located downtown, on the south-east corner of Temple Square. Street addresses are coordinates within the grid system in intervals of 100 every street. For example, one might speak of the intersection of 700 East and 2100 South as either "seventh east and twenty-first south" or "seven hundred east and twenty-one hundred south" (remember that in conversations, locals usually opt for the first one; try not to get confused between say, 7th East and 21st South and 7 East and 21 South, both of which are very different addresses). Addresses are specific numbers, such as 840 South 1300 East ("Eight-Forty south 13th east"). Downtown blocks are 1/8 of a mile in length, but blocks become more irregularly spaced farther from the city center. Most people will recognize the grid as one they studied in school, with a point of origin and 4 quadrants. After getting used to the system, you will find that it is very easy to navigate and simple to understand, although the streets become more and more irregular the farther south you move. It can also get confusing outside of the Salt Lake Valley, where many cities (whether or not theyve grown into each other) often have separate systems, so that a single road that divides two cities may have two different names for the grid systems of the two different cities. A different grid variant is found in the North East corner of Salt Lake City and is known as The Avenues. The Avenues are composed of North-south avenues which are lettered, A through U, while east-west avenues are numbered 1 though 14.  Significant neighborhoods in SLC include Downtown, the financial core thats home to Temple Square (the site of the LDS church headquarters, the Salt Lake Temple, and various other sites related to Mormon history and culture); Central City, the main residential area of the city, approximately 400 South to 900 South; Sugar House, a commercial/residential district with many funky shops; Federal Heights, an affluent district to the northeast; The Avenues a historical neighborhood with many old buildings; University, the area surrounding the sprawling  University of Utah  campus and the adjacent VA Medical Center, Research Park, and Fort Douglas; East Bench or Foothill, a residential area bisected by the major arterial road Foothill Boulevard between 900 South and I-80; Capitol Hill, an affluent district just north of Downtown topped by the Utah State Capitol building; Rose Park a residential in the northwest section of the city; and Glendale a residential, primarily Hispanic district to the southwest, home to the International Peace Gardens.  The benches are the mostly residential, upper-class communities constructed mostly along the slopes of the Wasatch Mountains on the east side of the valley, although they have recently been growing in the southern valley (the low Traverse Mountains) and the western valley (the Oquirrh Mountains). The east side is traditionally more affluent and conservative than the west side, leading to the expected "cultural rivalries" that you find in other cities with clear divides, although this divide is arguably less pronounced in Salt Lake City than in most major cities.  The  Wasatch Range  is the region located along the western edge of the Wasatch Mountain Range. It stretches from approximately Brigham City on the north to Santaquin on the south, and includes  Ogden , Salt Lake City, and  Provo . More than two-thirds of Utahs population are located in this region.  One thing to realize is that when people speak of Salt Lake City, they are often referring to Salt Lake Valley as a whole, or at least the suburbs adjoining Salt Lake City immediately to the south. Significant suburbs of Salt Lake City include  Sandy  (in the southern half of the valley),  Murray  and Midvale (in the center of the valley),  West Valley City  and  West Jordan  (large suburbs immediately to the southwest), and  Holladay , which although it only contains a small section of the eastern bench area, is often used to define the entire east bench area (often used colloquially with "Cottonwood"). "Millcreek" is used to define areas a little further north on the east bench and adjacent to Salt Lake City and south of I-80.  People who fly into Salt Lake City to visit the national parks and wild terrain of Southern Utah should keep in mind that just because theyre in the same state does not mean they are close; in most cases,  Las Vegas  is actually closer to the parks. Many of them are about a 5 hour drive away from Salt Lake City.</field>

		<field name="content">"This is the Place" Monument   Salt Lake City was settled in 1847 by Brigham Young and his followers in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the LDS Church or the Mormon Church, and whose followers are often called Mormons (originally a derogative term, now accepted and widely-used) or, less frequently (but more officially), Latter-day Saints. The Mormons migrated to the Salt Lake Valley following religious conflicts and violence in the East.  The city immediately became a major transit point for people moving westward in the California Gold Rush, and the LDS Churchs strong practice of missionary work drew converts primarily from Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia to emigrate to Salt Lake City during the 1850s and 1860s in long "handcart treks", a tradition that is now ingrained in Mormon culture. This migration allowed it to become one of the largest cities in the Old West, although the conservative Church values bucked the typical Old West trend of lawless towns, sheriffs, cowboys, brothels, and rowdy saloons. Pacific Islanders are another group that was significantly recruited by the Church, and Salt Lake City possesses an unusually high Pacific Islander population. The handcart tradition ended with the arrival of the railroad in 1870, which also, with the rise of mining and industry, contributed to the first major influx of "Gentiles" (non-Mormons) into the city.  Although the majority of Utahs residents are still members of the LDS Church (estimates generally range from 60%-70%, although the percentage of practicing members is lower), Salt Lake City itself is less than half Mormon, with some areas (especially areas dominated by ethnic minorities or more artsy areas such as the lower Avenues and Sugarhouse) being lower still.</field>

		<field name="content">Gallivan Center skating rink during the winter.    The climate of Salt Lake City is widely-variable from season to season. Its very dry, averaging from 14-20 inches (350–500nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year, much of which falls as snow, which averages from 50-80 inches (125–200nbsp;cm) per year. The wide variation is due to the huge elevation changes within the city; the lower amounts are the averages on the valley floor. Summers are hot, long, and particularly dry, while winters are cold and snowy.  Winter (mid-November to early March): Winter is generally a poor time to travel in Salt Lake City, unless youre looking to ski in the nearby ski resorts. Daytime temperatures generally run anywhere from 25°F to 50°F (-4-10°C). Low temperatures are usually below freezing, and on rare occasions can even drop below 0°F (-18°C). Snow falls often, but single snowfalls exceeding about 10 inches (25nbsp;cm) are rare. Even when it is not snowing, a phenomenon known as the inversion develops, which traps cold, moist air and air pollutants in the valley, sometimes for weeks on end. This can lead to some of the worst air quality conditions found in the country. The mountains are clear and beautiful during these times, but also quite warm. During an inversion, be prepared for fog on the valley bottom.  Because of the frequency of snow, it takes a very large snowstorm to cripple or shut down the city. Minor snowfalls are basically treated as a daily occurrence in winter, with the city continuing to operate as normal. Generally it takes about 12-15+ inches (30-38+ cm) valley-wide to have a significant effect on the activity of the city, and even more for a citywide shutdown. Despite the frequency of snowfall, it is usually calm (no blizzards are seen in Salt Lake City, unlike in the Midwest or Northeast), and most snowfalls are very light and fluffy (although heavy, wet snowfall can occur). Even though snow is common, there are still far too many people who dont know how to drive in it (often half-jokingly attributed by the locals to transplants from southern California).  Spring (early March to late May): Springs in Salt Lake City are mild, but it is also the wettest and windiest time of year. High temperatures during this time range from about 45°F to 80°F (7-27°C). Low temperatures are cool, and usually still drop below freezing on occasion into April. Although its the wettest time of year, its still dry in comparison to many cities in the Midwest or Eastern U.S., and heavy, prolonged rain is rare. Light-to-moderate snowfall can often be found well into April as well. Sunny spring days, which are quite common, offer some of the best weather available in Salt Lake City. However, the snowpack in the mountains usually reaches its peak in early April and doesnt melt entirely until late May or June, so spring is still a poor time to enjoy outdoor summer activities, such as hiking, camping, and boating, in the mountains. However, the ski resorts are usually open until mid-April, and  Snowbird  is often open longer.  Summer (late May to mid-September): Summer in Salt Lake City is long, dry, and hot. High temperatures during this period range anywhere from 80°F to 105°F (27-41°C). Humidity is very low and nights are usually comfortable. Although a very dry season, powerful Pacific storms can sometimes impact the city as late as early June, prolonging the wet season and keeping temperatures cooler. Mid-June through early July in particular is very dry. From mid-July to mid-September, the monsoon affects Utah, bringing fairly frequent evening thunderstorms to the city. Although sometimes these thunderstorms are very powerful, bringing hail, lightning, and street flooding, theyre usually relatively short-lived. Sometimes the humidity is so low that the rain doesnt even reach the valley floor. However, even a "dry" thunderstorm in the valley often drops heavy rain and even hail in the mountains. If you can avoid the thunderstorms, summer is a great time to enjoy outdoor activities in the mountains. The snow is long-gone by the end of June, and temperatures rarely reach above 80°F (27°C), even during the heart of summer.  Autumn (mid-September to mid-November): Autumn is the best time to visit Salt Lake City. Its usually drier and warmer than spring. Temperatures are comfortable, ranging from 45°F to 80°F (7-27°C) during the daytime. Powerful Pacific storms begin impacting the state by mid-October, but are usually infrequent. Although storms can again start dropping snow in the mountains, the snowpack usually doesnt begin building until November. The first light snowfall and overnight freezing temperatures in the valley usually occur by the beginning of November, and by mid-November, snowfall and cold temperatures should be prepared for. The leaves on the trees reach their brilliant peak color in the mountains in mid to late September and about a month later in the valleys.</field>

		<field name="content">The area was long inhabited by the native Kumeyaay people (also known as the Diegueño by the later Spanish settlers), who lived off the land and created a proud culture. The first time a European visited the region was in 1542, when Portuguese explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, sailing under the Spanish Flag, claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire and named the site San Miguel.  In November of 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno was sent to map the California coast. Arriving with his flagship "San Diego", Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what is now Mission Bay and Point Loma, renaming the area for the Spanish Catholic Saint, St. Didacus (more commonly known as San Diego).  San Diego was established in 1769 as the first Spanish mission in  California , at the present site of Old Town. However, due to the poor nature of soils in the Old Town area, the mission was eventually relocated about five miles up river in Mission Valley.   In the 19th century, San Diego passed from Spanish to Mexican to American hands. In 1850, a few years after the United States gained control of California, San Diego was officially designated a city. But with much of the westward expansion to California centered on the gold rush and San Francisco, American influences were slow to come to San Diego. Eventually they did, however, and in the later decades of the 19th century the railroad came to San Diego, resulting in further growth of the city and the establishment of Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods.  The U.S. Navy discovered San Diego in the early 20th century, and constructed a coaling station on Point Loma in 1907. Ten years later, the Naval Air Station on Coronado island was established, and in later years the Navy would take on an increasingly important role in the citys economy. Today San Diego is home to the Navys Pacific Fleet, and is a favorite leave location for sailors.  In recent decades, growth in San Diego has exploded, with many corporations moving their headquarters here and a huge influx of residents. Today its a favorite destination for retirees and tourists.</field>

		<field name="content">The San Diego area can be an incredible place to visit almost any time of the year.  With coastal temperatures around 75 degrees (24°C) most of the time, the weather is ideal.  The climate of Southern California is rather complex, however, and temperatures change rapidly as one travels from the coast eastward.  In the summer during the day, the temperature might increase as much as one degree Fahrenheit for each mile going east.  In the winter, especially at night, eastern areas are usually relatively cooler.  Some valleys and other areas have significantly different weather due to terrain and other factors. These are often referred to as "micro-climates".    If youre coming to San Diego expecting sunny weather, avoid coming in May or June, when San Diego is covered in clouds most days, a phenomenon referred to by the locals as "May Grey" or "June Gloom". September is usually the hottest month of the year in the daytime. Mid-September through October are labeled as the most at-risk months for wildfires, because of the long absence of any substantial rainfall. Along the beach during the warmer half of the year, it can get surprisingly cool after dark, even when its not too cold a short distance inland. The months of March and April typically see the strongest winds. Along the coast, fog is most common September through April; it is not uncommon to experience 3-7 foggy days per month.  During the late summer and fall there is a reversal of the usual climate conditions, when hot, dry air blows from the desert to the coast. These winds are called the Santa Ana winds. Milder Santa Ana winds can result in excellent dry air conditions, but powerful ones can last days on end, significantly raising temperatures, creating tremendous fire danger, and making the outdoors unpleasant.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Downtown San Diego began in 1867, when Alonzo Erastus Horton bought 960 acres of land by the San Diego Bay after he decided that this should be the center of the city rather than  Old Town , the site chosen by the Spanish for security reasons. Soon Horton found himself in the midst of an economic boom, resulting in the development of the southern Downtown neighborhoods, site of the present-day Gaslamp Quarter. However, in the late 1880s Hortons fortunes ran out and the Gaslamp Quarter began to deteriorate. At the same time, John D. Spreckels, a wealthy entrepreneur who had created a transportation and real estate empire in San Diego, began to develop land north of present-day Broadway, further contributing to the Gaslamp Quarters decline.  Over the decades, Downtown fell into a state of disrepair as investment in the suburbs took its toll on the central city. In the 1970s, redevelopment efforts began taking off, and in the 80s the area began to rebound with the completion of Horton Plaza, the San Diego Convention Center, and the start of revitalization efforts in the Gaslamp Quarter.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown is divided into a number of individual neighborhoods, each with its own attractions and personality.  At the heart is Columbia, which runs along Broadway as it approaches the harbor. Columbia is mostly a commercial district and contains most of the citys tallest buildings, the train depot, and a sizable chunk of the waterfront which includes the USS Midway Museum, the Maritime Museum, the cruise ship terminal and the ferry landing.  To the east of this lies the commercial and governmental center of  Core as well as the shopping district of Horton Plaza, with its splendid namesake mall.  To the north of the main business district are a couple of quieter neighborhoods - Cortez Hill, located on the hill at the north side of downtown, is a mostly residential neighborhood bumping up against Interstate 5, named for the historic El Cortez Hotel, the tallest building on the hill.  Closer to the waterfront at the northwest end of downtown is  Little Italy , originally a home to Italian fishermen, now a very active district of shops, restaurants, and parks, with an Italian theme.  On the southern side of Downtown, Marina is a highly gentrified waterfront district, containing marinas, highrise condos, hotels, the Convention Center, and the Seaport Village shopping mall. To the north of this is  Gaslamp Quarter , a historic district which was not only the birthplace of downtown but also the focal point of the first revitalization efforts in downtown during the 1970s. Today the neighborhood is the center of Downtowns nightlife scene; a thriving district of historic buildings, shops, theaters and restaurants.  Capitalizing on Gaslamps success, the East Village on the southeastern side of Downtown is undergoing a construction and redevelopment boom, spurred in part by the ballpark of the San Diego Padres, located within the neighborhood.</field>

		<field name="content">Located just north of the 48th parallel, Sandpoints climate is unique in the region. Although found not far from the deserts of Eastern Washington, Northern Idaho is on the rainy side of the next mountain chain - the  Rocky Mountains . Many climate maps show Sandpoint as arid or semi-arid but this is not accurate. With long, usually cold winters (average temperatures are generally below freezing, and dip to -20F for a week or two in February) and short, hot summers, (80-90F is the average, but be prepared for up to 100F for short periods) Sandpoint resembles a hemiboreal or even boreal climate, similar to the southern interior of Alaska ( Fairbanks  and the like, with milder winters). Winter lasts from late November to March, whereas summer weather doesnt hit until July and peaks in August. Spring (April-June) and autumn (September-early November) are generally rainy and cool. Storms are common - thunderstorms are the norm for hot summer afternoons and windstorms strike the most in spring.</field>

		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">Sanford has a humid subtropical climate, with mild weather during winters and hot weather during summers. High temperatures average 64 to 91 °F (18-33 °C) throughout the year. High heat indices are not uncommon for the summer months in the Sanford area. High temperatures can reach mid to high 90s with heat index ranges of 105-115 °F. The highest recorded temperature in Sanford was 103°F in July 1998. It is common for daily thunderstorms to erupt during a standard summer afternoon. These are caused by the heating of the land and water, combined with extremely high humidity.  During winter, the area can experience hard freezes during the night. Such cold weather is usually short lived, as the city averages only 15 nights below freezing. The coldest temperature recorded in Sanford was 19 °F on January 21, 1985, a day that still holds the record cold for many locations in the eastern half of the US. Even rarer in Sanford than freezing temperatures is snow. When snow does fall, it usually melts before touching the ground, or upon making contact with the ground.   Sanford has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities. Sanford has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms passing through the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area. Rainfall averages around 50 inches a year, with the wettest months being June through September.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Prior to European settlement in the area, the peninsula that now contains San Francisco was home to the Yelamu tribe, who were part of the larger Ohlone language group which stretched south from the Bay Area to the Big Sur of California. Due to San Franciscos characteristic foggy weather, the earliest European explorers completely bypassed the Golden Gate and the San Francisco Bay.  The first European settlement in the area was founded by the Spanish in 1776 as a mission community surrounding the Mission San Francisco de Asís, in what is today called the Mission Dolores in the Mission District. In addition to the mission, a military fort was built near the Golden Gate: El Presidio.  Upon gaining independence from Spain in 1821, the area became part of Mexico.  Under Mexican rule, the mission system gradually came to an end and private ownership of land became a possibility.  In 1835, an Englishman named William Richardson founded the town of Yerba Buena, the first significant settlement on the peninsula outside of the Mission Dolores area. As the new settlement gradually grew, Yerba Buena developed a street plan and became attractive to settlers.  In 1846, the United States claimed California, and in July of that year, the U.S. Navy arrived to raise the American flag above Yerba Buena. Over the next couple of years, California officially became part of the United States following the Mexican-American War, and the name of the town was changed from Yerba Buena to San Francisco.  In 1848 the California Gold Rush started in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Waves of fortune-seeking immigrants arrived by boat in San Francisco, increasing the Citys population from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands. People who made their fortunes then settled in San Francisco, which at the time was the largest, most exciting city in northern California. Like other large cities, eventually San Francisco developed into districts by nationality or social status: the Italians in North Beach, the Chinese in Chinatown, and the wealthy mining, railroad titans on Nob Hill. During the gold rush years many major businesses were created and flourished in San Francisco (Wells Fargo Bank, Levis, Bank of America), and famous (and infamous) personalities settled in the city. Of course, with all this success came problems: the rapid growth of the city outstripped any efforts at city planning, meaning proper sanitation and infrastructure were largely undeveloped, which led to a cholera outbreak in 1855. Violence and corruption were evident, and anti-immigrant violence resulted in many race riots.  In the 1890s, there was a large campaign to modernize and beautify the city, the success of which led some officials to proudly call San Francisco the "Paris of the West." But in 1906, a devastating earthquake shook the city and a resulting fire leveled much of the city (in fact, almost 90% of the total damage was from the fire, and not the quake itself). Nevertheless, officials at the time immediately set out on a plan to rebuild the city, with new parks, boulevards, the current civic center complex, and landmarks such as the Coit Tower atop Telegraph Hill. In 1915, San Francisco hosted the Panama-Pacific Exposition (where the Palace of Fine Arts complex is currently located) to showcase the completely rebuilt city.  In the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s, San Francisco remained largely unscathed. In fact, it was during this time that the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge were conceived and built. It was also during this time that the Federal Government established a prison on Alcatraz Island, which would hold some of the most notorious criminals of the era.  After World War II, San Francisco continued to grow in population. Aggressive urban planning projects led to a changing skyline, the City adding more highrises to its Financial District. In the 1950s new freeways rimmed the Citys waterfront (deemed ugly and an eyesore to an otherwise beautiful waterfront, after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake the "Embarcadero freeway" was torn down and not replaced).   Besides being a beautiful city to visit, from the 1950s forward San Francisco became known as the city of the cool, quirky, unusual, and counterculture. There were the Beatniks of the fifties and sixties, and the "stoned" hippies in the sixties and seventies. "Only in San Francisco" became part of the lexicon to describe San Franciscos counterculture and rebel population, a reputation that still exists today.   The film industry also made San Francisco world-famous and instantly recognizable. The City provided a superb backdrop for a movie, regardless of genre or topic.    Since year 2000 San Francisco has experienced a boom in business and other development. When the dot-com bubble burst San Francisco city government quickly acted. It loosened building restrictions and aggressively courted industry/business with tax breaks and other incentives, to either locate to San Francisco or not move out. Significantly, City government pushed for development of its blighted industrial section (known as "South of Market" and "China Basin"). The San Franciscos SoMa area now has numerous office complexes, a major league baseball stadium, condominium housing, the University of California (medical school), dot-com industry, and supporting infrastructure (roads, rail, and bus). As a result of its efforts, San Franciscos business economy was not as hard hit as other cities by the dot-com bust, recession, and later real estate downturn.    Business is second to tourism as San Franciscos largest industries. Tourism is San Franciscos largest industry. The City consistently remains at the top five of the worlds most popular tourist destinations.</field>

		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">San Francisco has a mild climate, with cool, wet winters and dry summers. In most months, you can expect the high temperature to be in the upper 50s, 60s or low 70s degrees Fahrenheit (between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius). However, these mild temperature readings belie a unique climate not shared by other major cities in the state or country.  Summer days usually start out under fog, slowly burning off towards the ocean into a sunny albeit windy afternoon. Measureable precipitation during the summer months is rare, although light drizzle is possible. Humidity is very constant, but rarely uncomfortable. At late afternoon, when the fog and wind returns people generally find themselves needing a jacket (and this is summer!). There are some days when the fog lingers all day.  In the winter, the rainy season is in full swing. That being said, the chances for a calm, windless, sunny day are actually higher in the winter than in the summer! However, the overall temperatures are going to be lower in the winter.  Spring and fall are not so much seasons in themselves in San Francisco, but rather they are quick transitional periods with some days resembling summer and others the winter. Fall in particular is a good time to visit because the summer wind fog has mostly gone, but the rainy season has not yet started. The late summer month of September, as summer transitions into fall, is the warmest and driest month of the entire year for San Francisco. Heat waves can occasionally occur around this time of year.  Within these general rules, San Francisco also has a series of microclimates created by the citys topography and maritime setting. Large hills in the citys center block much of the fog, wind, and precipitation that rolls in from the Pacific Ocean. Because of this, there can be significant weather differences in different parts of the city and the surrounding Bay Area at the same time. Generally, the more windward areas along the coast (e.g., the Outer Sunset) are cooler and foggier, while the more leeward areas in the east are warmer and drier (e.g., the Mission). Temperature differences of 10-15 degrees or so are common on days where the fog persists on the western side of the city. These differences continue as you move east, out of the city, into the East bay, and into the outer East Bay (on the other side of the hills from Berkeley and Oakland), where it can be much hotter and drier. Local meteorologists routinely have three forecasts: one for the coast, one for the bay, and one for the inland areas. In short, if you dont like the weather, perhaps travel a few miles east or west to your desired climate.</field>

		<field name="content">San Francisco literature finds its roots in the citys long and often tumultuous history, its diversity, and its attraction to eclectic characters; the city was a major center for the Beat poetry movement and seems to also hold an uncanny attraction for science fiction writers. Among the most famous works set in San Francisco:  Jack Kerouac spent a lot of time in San Francisco, and portions of two of his most influential works are set here: On the Road and The Dharma Bums. Both are accounts of Kerouac examining his place in the universe; the first a tale of a man traveling the country, the second a story of someone looking for the simple life. The Maltese Falcon, Dashiell Hammett. A gripping detective novel set in San Francisco that would come to define the private detective genre. The novel follows private eye Sam Spade as he tries to retrieve a valuable bird figurine, and has been adapted into film twice, including one where Spade was played by none other than Humphrey Bogart. Tales of the City, Armistead Maupin. A famous series which offers an excellent look into 1970s San Francisco, particularly the citys counter culture and alternative lifestyles.  Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson lived in San Francisco in the mid-60s and the city appears in many of his books and articles. Philip K. Dick spent much of his life in the San Francisco area, and among his novels set here are Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, set in a post-apocalyptic near future where androids serve humankind and bounty hunters are called in to "retire" androids that become too independent, and The Man in the High Castle, an alternate universe novel where Japan and Germany won World War II. The Bridge trilogy (Virtual Light, Idoru, and All Tomorrows Parties), William Gibson. Set in a futuristic San Francisco following a massive earthquake, in which the city has been rebuilt using nanotechnology and a race is on to control the new cyberspace technology. Altered Carbon, Richard K. Morgan. Also set in a futuristic San Francisco, where human personalities can be stored digitally and downloaded into new bodies. The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon. A renowned novel which follows a woman who sinks into paranoia as she attempts to unravel a worldwide conspiracy. The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan. A story of four Chinese American immigrant families who start a club and spend their time playing the Chinese game of Mahjong and tell of their struggles in traveling to America. The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Tom Wolfe. A nonfictional account which perfectly captures the Hippie movement, following a band of psychedelic drug users across the country in their painted school bus. Barbary Coast, Herbert Asbury. For a nonfictional work on the tumultuous early history of San Francisco, this is an excellent choice.</field>

		<field name="content">San Francisco has been the backdrop for many films, due in part to the Bay Areas vibrant filmmaking community and the citys proximity to Hollywood. The production companies of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, along with the animation company Pixar are just a few of the big players who call the San Francisco area home. Among the better films set in San Francisco:   The Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941).  Humphrey Bogart stars as a San Francisco private detective dealing with three unscrupulous adventurers who compete to obtain a fabulous jewel-encrusted statuette of a falcon.  Dark Passage (Delmer Daves, 1947). An offbeat film noir featuring two icons of the genre, Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. The citys dark alleyways and side streets are on prominent display throughout the eccentric story of a man wrongly accused of murder and an enigmatic woman who lives in a lavish art deco apartment on top of the Filbert Steps.  Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958). While its not the only Hitchcock film set in San Francisco (portions of The Birds are set here), Vertigo really packs in a lot the city, following a private investigator who suffers from acrophobia as he uncovers the mystery of one womans peculiar behavior and travels from one San Francisco landmark to the next.  Bullitt (Peter Yates, 1968). A very popular and highly influential crime thriller starring Steve McQueen (who also starred in the locally-set The Towering Inferno) and featuring one of the best car chase scenes in the history of cinema.  Dirty Harry (Don Siegel, 1971). Another cop film set in San Francisco (in addition, all but one of the sequels were also set here), starring Clint Eastwood chasing down sadistic killers and asking people if they feel lucky. Well do they, punk?  48 Hrs. (Walter Hill, 1982). Often credited with starting the buddy-cop genre, this flick follows a hot-headed cop who has to team up with a wisecracking convict in order to find two cop killers in the crime-ridden underworld of San Francisco.  Psych-Out (Richard Rush, 1968). An incredibly trippy film with psychedelic music (including an appearance from Strawberry Alarm Clock), recreational drugs, and Haight-Ashbury — Hippies aplenty in this one.  Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Philip Kaufman, 1978). Emotionless drones impersonating people and hatched from pods take over San Francisco in this classic science fiction flick.  A whole host of great films have been set at Alcatraz; among them are Escape from Alcatraz (Don Siegel, 1979), Birdman of Alcatraz (John Frankenheimer, 1962), The Rock (Michael Bay, 1996), and the very influential Point Blank (John Boorman, 1967).  Chan Is Missing (Wayne Wang, 1982). Illustrating the problems experienced by Chinese-Americans, this film tells the story of two taxi drivers searching Chinatown for a man who ran off with their money.  Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (Leonard Nimoy, 1986). In the 23rd century, San Francisco is the home of Starfleet Command and humpback whales have long been extinct. In this installment of the popular franchise, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew have to time travel to a more contemporary San Francisco to bring back a couple of whales and save Earth.  Milk (Gus Van Sant, 2008). A recent biopic on the life of Harvey Milk, the former San Francisco City Supervisor in the late 1970s and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office. This story still holds sway for many San Franciscans given the citys role in the ongoing gay rights movement.  La Mission (Peter Bratt, 2009).  Ultra-macho ex-con Che Rivera learns the true meaning of being a father when he discovers his son is gay.</field>

		<field name="name">architecture</field>
		<field name="content">The Palace of Fine Arts   San Francisco is known for its Victorian architecture, particularly in the central and northern neighborhoods (e.g., Haight-Ashbury, Alamo Square, Noe Valley, Castro, Nob Hill, and Pacific Heights). The city has one of the most restrictive building and planning codes in the world, which helps preserve the historical architecture in certain areas and create a severe shortage of housing stock, which drives up the price of housing. The exorbitant price of housing, both buying and renting, is a favorite topic of San Francisco locals. It helps to explain why there are so few families in San Francisco (another favorite topic).  In recent years, San Francisco has undergone high-rise construction boom centered in SoMa, just south of what was historically the center of downtown. This was one of the few areas of the city left for development (i.e. without entrenched anti-development policies). Unlike other major cities like New York and Chicago, San Francisco is not known for having buildings built by star architects. This may be due to the difficulty of getting projects approved in the city.</field>

		<field name="content">San Francisco prides itself on its openness to diversity in race, gender, sexual orientation and personal style.  This trait is widely considered to be one of the defining features of the city, and it draws both visitors and transplants alike.  English is the dominant language spoken in San Francisco.  Cantonese  is spoken by some citizens of San Franciscos large Chinese population, with an increasing  Mandarin -speaking minority.   Spanish  is also commonly spoken in San Francisco, especially in the  Mission District .  Tobacco smokers beware: as in the rest of California, smoking is illegal in bars, restaurants, and other public places. Additionally, the City of San Francisco has a local ordinance that require smokers to go all the way to the curb (or if there is no curb, at least 25 feet from any building - not simply the entrances). As of January 2013 enforcement is inconsistent and the odds youll be hassled for standing and smoking outside a restaurant or bar are low. Bay Area people can be particularly vocal about personal habits, so take care and be mindful and respectful of others when smoking, even in places where it is allowed.  On the other hand, smoking marijuana is remarkably well-tolerated.  If you are visiting from elsewhere in the U.S., you may be very surprised to find that marijuana is not considered to be a problem by San Franciscans, and even by the citys police.  While still illegal under federal law, a law was passed in 2006 officially making marijuana the lowest priority for the SFPD.  This does not mean that you should smoke marijuana just anywhere, but the rules of etiquette are difficult to navigate. You will find people smoking marijuana at large concerts, but not small concerts. You will find people smoking marijuana on a street corner in the middle of the day in some neighborhoods (e.g., Haight-Ashbury) but frowned upon in others (e.g., the Financial District).  Public nudity has been celebrated among some residents in recent decades. More recently, however, there has been some controversy surrounding public nudity in San Francisco. There is now a law banning some public nudity, with nudists actively opposing the law.  Its worth mentioning that natives tend to dislike many of the nicknames given to their city. Instead of saying "San Fran," "Frisco," or "SFO," most refer to San Francisco by its full name or just "The City."  The Bay Area has of one the most vibrant high-tech startup scenes in the world. While the venture capital firms are largely in the South Bay, many of the small startups and tech workers are in San Francisco.</field>

To the east, Sanibel borders Pine Island Sound and San Carlos Bay.  The majority of the waterfront on the Sound is part of J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, including the calm waters of Tarpon Bay.  People looking for well-groomed white-sand beaches on Sanibel may be disappointed.  The beaches are less maintained and more natural than in many locations.  Seashell collectors will be pleasantly surprised by the density of seashells.</field>

The town clusters around the feet of the 1000 foot Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white "M" (for Mission High School). Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white "P") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Santa Fe was once the capital of Spains, and then Mexicos, territories north of the Rio Grande, but its visible history extends far beyond the arrival of the Spanish; it is thought to have been the site of Puebloan villages that had already been long abandoned by the time the Spanish arrived in 1607.  It became the state capital when the territory of New Mexico achieved statehood in 1912.  In the early 20th century, the area attracted a number of artists, such as Georgia OKeeffe and Alfred Stieglitz. The region remains important on Americas art scene.   The arrival of Igor Stravinsky and the founding of the Santa Fe Opera, one of the worlds leading opera companies, had a similarly invigorating and enduring influence on the musical community.  Many people go to Santa Fe for spiritual gatherings and to practice meditative arts at the many spas and resorts that are in and around Santa Fe.  Santa Fe is rooted in paradoxes.  On the one hand, it is one of the United States oldest cities (by some reckonings the oldest), and many residents can trace their roots and property holdings in town back to the 17th century.  On the other hand, it has also been the target of a teeming influx of wealthy immigrants in the last 30 years or so that has spurred a great deal of new construction and created inflated prices for real estate—and drastically elevated taxes on old family properties, many of which are owned by families that cant afford the taxes.  The tension between new and old, rich and poor, etc., is a persistent undercurrent in the community.  These and other factors (not the least of which is a well-deserved reputation as a haven for flamboyant characters) contribute to Santa Fes uniqueness.</field>

		<field name="name">climate</field>
		<field name="content">Much of the citys attractiveness, from both scenic and cultural perspectives, arises from its setting in the foothills of the  Sangre de Cristo Mountains . This location produces a mild continental climate with four distinct seasons. Winters are pleasant, with day-time highs usually in the 40s (Fahrenheit), often "feeling" warmer due to the sunny conditions. Snow varies wildly from year to year; some winters see almost no snow, while others will have several individual storms dropping a foot or more each. (The sun and high altitude mean that roads usually arent clogged too badly, even by the big storms, for more than a day or two, as the snow melts rapidly.) Spring, usually dry and moderate in temperature, is still probably the least pleasant time to visit from a weather perspective, because of strong winds. Early summer (June, early July) is hot and dry, with highs around 90, but gives way around mid-July to a truly delightful climate as summer, monsoonal thunderstorms peel off the mountains and cool the afternoons down. Bring rainwear if visiting in July or August. The monsoons typically die out in early September leading to a fall with dry, sunny days and clear, crisp evenings; first frost is usually in October, with snow starting to stick in the mountains at about that time.  One caution: the elevation is high enough to challenge the lungs of the visitor freshly up from sea level.  Its wise to spend your first day on relatively sedentary activities (museums, walking the downtown area) and move to more active things after youve had some time to acclimatize.</field>

		<field name="content">The forest is predominantly coniferous, with piñon/juniper "scrub" at the lowest elevations that gives way to ponderosa pines mid-range and spruce/fir forest higher up.  Aspens are intermixed with the conifers above about 8000 (2400 meters) and provide additional color, particularly in fall.  Timberline is unusually high at 11,500/3500 meters or even higher.  Many of the higher peaks are veritable gardens of alpine wildflowers once the snow has melted.  Black bear and deer are common throughout the forest.  The eastern unit contains bighorn sheep (some of which have become so used to human presence as to constitute a camp pest), and a substantial elk population splits time between the western unit (and the  Valles Caldera National Preserve ) in summer and  Bandelier National Monument  in winter.  Mountain lions live in the forest but are rarely encountered.  Birds are plentiful and diverse, including eagles, wild turkeys, and several species of hummingbirds.  Most of the terrain is too high for snakes to be abundant, although rattlesnakes are occasionally seen as high as Pajarito Ski Area near Los Alamos, elevation 9500 (2900 m).  Watercourses tend to be small and seasonal, so that there are few large fish, although some lakes and streams are able to sustain a population of trout.</field>

		<field name="content">The large elevation variations in the forest preclude universal, concise statements about climate.  Snow and freezing temperatures (at least at night) are possible year-round on the high summits; shirtsleeve weather is common in the winter at the lower elevations.  About the only common denominator is that springtime is windy and relatively dry.  Broadly, the higher elevations (say above 8000 feet, or 2400 meters) have conditions typical of continental mountain ranges, generally somewhat warmer and drier than the similar ranges of  Colorado .  Snowfall during winter is wildly variable, but normally covers the high peaks above timberline and persists through spring, commonly closing many campgrounds until May or so.  Many hiking trails in the high country still have snow on them in June.  Spring is warm and dry, with a gradual onset of thunderstorms starting in June and building to a "monsoon" condition in August.  The high peaks are notoriously prone to lightning strikes; if youre hiking, make sure youre off the summits by 1PM during the summer.  Fall is clear, crisp and delightful, with the first significant snow usually in October and the first snow that "sticks" frequently occurring around Thanksgiving.  The lower elevations are semi-arid, and winter snowfall is even more variable than at higher elevations.  Some winters have seen individual storms that deposit over 40 inches (1 meter) of snow, while in other years, winter passes without this much snow falling in the entire season.  Low temperatures can drop below zero (Fahrenheit).  Spring is warm and dry, sometimes downright hot -- high temperatures can reach 90nbsp;°F (38nbsp;°C) or higher -- and dry conditions persist deeper into the summer than in the higher elevations.  The monsoonal thunderstorms begin to drift off the mountains in July to cool (and soak) the lower elevations, until the warm, dry fall conditions begin soon after Labor Day.</field>

		<field name="content">Santa Rosas history is rich in culture and many different groups have called the area their home. Pomo, Miwok, and Wappo Indians originally populated the area followed by the Spanish in the early 1800s. The first deeded land was held as the Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa and was given to Senora Maria Ignacia Lopez de Carrillo by Spanish authorities.  In 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.  The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it had been, or was being, overtaken by many other newer population centers in the  San Francisco Bay Area  and  Southern California . According to a 1905 article in the Press Democrat newspaper reporting on the Battle of the Trains, the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.  The April 18, 1906 San Francisco Earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the citys population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.  In 1943, Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller, Shadow of Doubt in Santa Rosa. He would continue to use Santa Rosa, and later  Bodega Bay  in many of his films. Thanks to this, Santa Rosa became, and continues to be a major hub in the Bay Area for numerous movies.</field>

		<field name="content">Humans have traveled or lived in the Southern Sierra for at least 6-7,000 years. In the higher mountains, and also down into the western foothills, lived hunters and gatherers remembered today as the Monache or Western Mono. West of the Monache in the lowest foothills and also across the expanses of the Great Central Valley were a second group, the Yokuts.  In the late 1700s and early 1800s, Spanish began exploring the edge of the Sierras. Soon afterwards, trappers, sheepherders, miners, and loggers poured into the Sierras seeking to exploit whatever the mountains had to offer. By the end of the 19th century, San Joaquin Valley communities increasingly looked to the Sierras for water and recreation. In the struggle between all these competing interests, two national parks were born that became what we know today as Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Today the parks together protect 265 Native American archeological sites and 69 historic sites.</field>

		<field name="content">Extreme topographic differences and a striking elevation gradient (ranging from 1,360 feet (412 m) in the foothills to 14,494 feet (4,417 m) along the Sierran crest) create a rich tapestry of environments, from the hot, dry lowlands along the western boundary to the stark and snow-covered alpine high country.  This topographic diversity in turn supports over 1,200 species (and more than 1400 taxa, including subspecies and varieties) of vascular plants, which make up dozens of unique plant communities. These include not only the renowned groves of massive giant sequoia, but also vast tracts of montane forests, spectacular alpine habitats, and oak woodlands and chaparral.  The richness of the Sierran flora mirrors that of the state as a whole—of the nearly 6,000 species of vascular plants known to occur in California, over 20% of them can be found within Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.  Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks support a wide diversity of animal species, reflecting the range in elevation, climate, and habitat variety here. Over 260 native vertebrate species are in the parks; numerous additional species may be present but have not been confirmed. Of the native vertebrates, five species are extirpated (extinct here), and over 150 are rare or uncommon.  There have been some studies of invertebrates here, but there is not enough information to know how many species occur in the parks. Many of the parks caves contain invertebrates, some of which occur only in one cave and are known nowhere else in the world.</field>

These elevations (4,000 - 7,000 feet) receive an average of 40-45" (102–114nbsp;cm) of precipitation annually. Much of this falls during the winter, resulting in a deep blanket of snow from December to May. Sub-zero temperatures, however, are rare. In the summer, occasional afternoon thundershowers may occur.  In fall and winter, Lodgepole Campground is generally 10-15 degrees F (6-9 degrees C) colder than the average middle-elevation temperature shown on the chart.  Summer temperatures in Cedar Grove are generally hotter than the average for the middle elevations, and cooler than the foothills. Temperatures in mid-summer may reach the 90s (35-40 degrees C). Cedar Grove is closed in the winter due to common rockfalls on the road.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Shades was originally home to Native Americans, specifically offshoots of the Miami tribe. In the late 1820s settlers arrived after the area was ceded to the US government by the Miamis. Due to the poor soil and distinct land topography the area was not used for farming, maintaining its beautiful environment.  Many tales of Indian battles and ghostly creatures called "shades" haunting the area are legendary tales of the park. The title of "The Shades of Death" for these little ghostly shades gave the park its name.  Since the park name "The Shades of Death" wasnt too positive, they changed it to "The Shades."   Government surveys in the early 1800s showed a series of natural springs. Before becoming a park the land was purhcased by the Garland Dells Mineral Springs to be used as a health resort and recreation area called "The Shades." In 1887 they built a 40 room inn, and the land was preserved. Eventually, through a series of business transactions, in 1947 the business and land was purchased by a holding company and they held a public campaign called "Save the Shades." They raised enough funds, and the land became the 15th state park, saved from timber cutters who wanted to use the oak trees for whiskey barrels.</field>

		<field name="content">The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest day in American Military History. 23,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or missing after twelve hours of savage combat on 17 September 1862. The Battle of Antietam ended the first Confederate invasion into the North and led to Abraham Lincolns issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.  The Battle of Antietam was the culmination of the Maryland Campaign of 1862, the first invasion of the North by Confederate General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Following a defeat at South Mountain, General Lee considered ending his campaign in the North and withdrawing to  Virginia , but upon hearing of General Stonewall Jacksons victory at  Harpers Ferry , he decided to make a stand at Sharpsburg.   The Confederate commander gathered his forces on the high ground west of Antietam Creek with Gen. James Longstreets command holding the center and the right while Stonewall Jacksons men filled in on the left. Union General George McClellan focused the Union forces upon the left flank of the Confederate Army along the Sunken Road, and hammered away in brutal stalemate. Union General Ambrose Pierce led the planned assault upon the Confederate right flank seven hours into the battle, after General Lee had already transferred many troops to the left flank, but was held up in capturing the bridge that bears his name by a small Confederate force from a higher defensive position. After taking the bridge, General Pierce paused for two hours to reorganize his forces, delaying his assaults upon the Confederate right flank. By the end of the day, General McClellans assault had failed to break either flank, leaving a large portion of his central forces out of play, leaving the brave efforts of his men in the fight nullified by his overly cautious assault. General McClellan left the battle embarrassed and in poor standing with the President. The tactical stalemate remained, both armies were decimated (nearly 1/4 of the men fighting), and Sharpsburg was nearly destroyed. General Lee, seeking to avoid a drawn-out battle of attrition with the larger Union forces, withdrew across the Potomac, ending his strategic campaign in the North.  This bloody battle, despite the underwhelming tactical performance by Union generals, marked a strategic turning point for the North, as General Lee would from this point be forced to fight on Confederate soil. Perhaps even more importantly, the "victory" here gave President Lincoln the opportunity to make his Emancipation Proclamation, thereby making the war no longer just an attempt to restore Union sovereignty over the South, but a greater cause of ridding the United States of the evil practice of slavery. This gave the Union an important boost in morale, and helped keep foreign powers leery of supporting the cause of slavery from aligning with the South.</field>

The southern area of this ice sheet was located in what is now the Shawnee National Forest. Because of this, there are tons of interesting and spectacular bluffs and overlooks located throughout the entire park. The geologic processes that formed the landscape are partially responsible for the presence of important mineral resources, including some of national significance.</field>

		<field name="content">The oldest rocks in the Blue Ridge Mountains were created over a billion years ago as magma deep within the earths crust moved upward. Over eons it cooled, fractured, and was joined by younger metamorphic rocks formed from sedimentary deposits. All were altered and eroded to shape todays granite peaks and sylvan hollows.  Around 8,000-9,000 years ago, but seconds in geologic time, the first traces of humans were recorded on the land that would become the park. Native Americans seasonally visited the area to hunt, to gather nuts and berries, and to find sources for and to make their stone tools.  Europeans first experienced the beauty of these mountains less than 300 years ago. First came hunters and trappers, and soon after 1750 the first settlers moved into the lower hollows near springs and streams. Over the next 150 years many hundreds of families built homesteads, mills and stores and planted orchards and crops. The mountains were logged and minerals were mined. Vacation resorts were established to allow guests to experience the mountain views, healthy water, and cool breezes. American society became urban, industrial, and yearned for special places for recreation and refuge.  In the early 20th century the first calls for National parks in the east were heard in the United States Congress. It would be two decades before Shenandoah National Park was authorized and another ten years before it was established. During that time President Herbert Hoover and his wife Louise Henry Hoover established their Summer White House on the Rapidan River, the construction of Skyline Drive began, the Civilian Conservation Corps was established and moved into the park area, and over 450 families of mountain residents were relocated from the Blue Ridge; many of these families were vehemently opposed to losing their homes and communities.  With the establishment of the park in December 1935, the CCC began to build visitor facilities throughout the mountain, areas that were initially racially segregated. The core of the parks development was completed by the beginning of WWII and, to a great extent, the mountains were released to nature.</field>

The park rises above the Virginia Piedmont to its east and the Shenandoah Valley to its west. Two peaks exceed 4,000 feet. The range of elevation, slopes and aspects of mountain and hillsides, rock and soil types, precipitation conditions, and latitude interact to create a mix of habitats.  The park’s biota and natural features include: well-exposed strata of the Appalachians, one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world; diverse animal and plant populations and habitats; migratory bird stop-over points; and forested watersheds that perpetuate numerous streams flowing from uplands to lowlands.  Shenandoah is the largest fully protected area in the mid-Appalachian region.</field>

		<field name="content">The Atlantic Ocean, and in particular the Gulf Stream, plays an important role in Virginia’s precipitation regime. Winter storms generally track from the west to the east and in the vicinity of the east coast move to the northeast paralleling the coast and the Gulf Stream. This shift to northeast results partly from the tendency of storms to follow the boundary between the cold land and the warm Gulf Stream. When sufficiently cold air comes into Virginia from the west and northwest, frontal storms can bring heavy snowfall. Thunderstorms occur in all months of the year, with a maximum in September and minimum in February. Storms and high runoff conditions can occur year-round in Shenandoah. Most locations receive 100-150 cm of precipitation per year. The average annual precipitation at Big Meadows is 132 cm, which includes about 94 cm of snow. South to southwest winds predominate, with secondary maximum frequency from the north. Lower elevation areas of the park experience modified continental climate, with mild winters and warm, humid summers. The mean annual temperature in the lowland area at Luray averages 12 degrees C, and average annual precipitation is 91 cm, with about 43 cm of snow.  Higher elevation areas of the park experience winters that are moderately cold and summers that are relatively cool. The mean annual temperature at Big Meadows averages about 9 degrees C. Mean maximum daily temperatures in July average about 6 degrees C cooler at Big Meadows then in the lowland areas of the park. Temperatures in January range from about –7 degrees C to 4 degrees C and in July from about 14-24 degrees C. Snow and ice are common in the winter, but they usually melt quickly, leaving the ground bare. Occasional major snow or ice storms can cause considerable damage to the trees within the park.</field>

		<field name="title">Silverdale (Washington)</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Native American Salish people lived comfortably in the Puget Sound area navigating the local waterways in well made cedar canoes for thousands of years and developed a complex ritualistic society before 1792 when Captain George Vancouver discovered the area, named it after one of his officers and declared the area for Great Briton.  Once the Washington Territory was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area tribes to acquire their lands. The Suquamish people ceded most of their land around the Kitsap Peninsula to the United States and logging came into the area in full force. The areas once impassible thick forests gave way to farms, towns and industry as lumber was shipped off to areas such as San Francisco or burned as fuel for the growing fleet of boats known as the Mosquito Fleet.  It was loggers who settled in Silverdale in 1854.  They expanded their operations into the valleys of Kitsap County, building roads as they went.  By the 1880s, Scandinavian immigrants were moving into the area seeking work.  As the timber production took the prime trees and opened up large areas, attention turned to farming.    Farming conditions were excellent and the family farms thrived.  The Farmers Cooperative was formed in 1887.  Dairy, chicken and hog farms abounded even through the middle 20th century.  The town was named in 1878.  Settler William Littlewood wanted to name the town Goldendale, but it turned out that another town bore that name. Instead of trying to find an entirely new name, he changed the "gold" to "silver" and named it Silverdale.  In the mid 1880s steamer boats began making regular trips to Seattle from the Kitsap area and by 1900 the sloop "Telka" departed Silverdale for Seattle once a week.  While the Silverdale Dock was the center of entertainment and commercial trade well into the 1900s, the community remained a fairly quiet, family-oriented town.  Remnants of its beginnings as an agricultural and timber center can be found at places such as the Old Mill Site on Bucklin Hill Rd.  The announcement by the Navy that it would develop its West Coast Trident Submarine Base at Bangor, caused a rush of change in the community as more people moved in to the area and businesses moved into the region to support the growing population. Several attempts towards city-hood have been defeated, leaving the community an unincorporated part of the county overseen by a Commissioner, elected to a Board of three serving from the county seat in Port Orchard.  Silverdale managed to enter the 21st century with some undeveloped land -- pastures, roaming deer and old-time barns. You can also still find a solitary, tree-lined avenue or a quiet park. In fact, relaxing spots can be found in the Silverdale waterfront park, on the Clear Creek Trail and Island Lake County park.</field>

		<field name="content">According to a Chippewa legend, a bear and her two cubs swam across Lake Michigan to escape a fire on the other side.  The mother reached exhausted safety on the shore, but was unable to save her cubs, who drowned within sight of shore.  The Great Spirit Manitou transformed the mother into a huge sand dune (looking out toward the lake), and the cubs into islands.  The area became important to Great Lakes shipping in the 19th century, as one of the few large safe harbors on the way around the Lower Peninsula to Chicago.  Farming, both for subsistence and to supply passing ships was an important local industry.  The National Lakeshore was assembled in the 1960s and 1970s, largely from private land (and not without some controversy), eventually including not only the recreational immediate area of Sleeping Bear Dune, but the geologically ndash; and scenically ndash; significant shoreline to the south and northeast, and the two Manitou Islands.</field>

		<field name="content">The National Lakeshore consists primarily of a 35-mile (60nbsp;km) stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline, featuring immense sand dunes rising as high as 460 feet above the lake, sculpted entirely by the winds and waters.  The park includes or borders several small inland lakes and the mouth of the Platte River at its south end.  The mainland portion of the park is broken into three sections by the villages of Empire and Glen Arbor.  The park also includes North and South Manitou Islands, each about 6–7 miles from shore.  These were high points of ridges left as the glaciers receded, covered by wind-blown sand, and partially forested.  North Manitou (7.75 by 4.25 miles) includes low-lying sandy regions in the southeast, rising to hills and 400-foot sand dunes in the northwest.  South Manitou (about 3 by 4 miles) features perched dunes on the west, descending to a wide, concave harbor in the east.</field>

		<field name="content">The sand dunes provide a distinctive environment for vegetation.  Dune grasses long roots seek out water and help to hold the dunes together, along with thistles, bearberries, and other hardy plants.  Juniper and jack pine take hold in the sand.  Oak and white pine trees are found slightly inland from the beach.  Further inland (where the soil is richer) its a prime example of a beech/maple hardwood forest with some hemlock, basswood, and black cherry.  Birds can be found throughout the park, especially waterfowl such as Canada geese, loons, ducks, mergansers, and gulls.  Shorebirds such as the sandpiper are common; the endangered piping plover nests on the North Manitou shoreline, parts of which are off-limits during mating season for this reason.  Bald eagles nest on the islands, but hawks and owls are the main predatory birds.  Sandhill cranes can be found in some wetlands.  Thrushes and warblers inhabit the woodlands; the threatened prairie warbler nests in the mainland dunes along Lake Michigan.  Despite the parks name, black bears are rare in the area.  Chipmunks, fox squirrels, and gray squirrels (including the uncommon black variety) are commonplace.  The northern flying squirrel (which really just glides short distances) lives here but isnt often seen.  Several species of bats (which fly quite well) are out between dusk and dawn.  Raccoons like to hang out around campsites to scavenge.  Beavers, otters, and minks can be found around inland lakes and streams.  Bobcats (a feline slightly larger than a housecat) are present but avoid human contact.  White-tailed deer have become increasingly common since forests were cleared in the area (they are hunted, in season) -- and are known to host deer ticks, which also attack humans.  Coyotes and opossums are other recent arrivals to the area.  Cougars have been sighted (see "Stay safe"), though they are generally elusive and avoid contact.  The islands have a limited variety of mammals, due to their distance from the mainland and their small size.  Beavers, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, snowshoe hares, bats, and coyotes can be found.  North Manitou also has raccoons and white-tailed deer.  The deer were introduced, and because they had no predators overwhelmed the island, eradicating some plant species and halting the growth of new maple, cedar, and pine trees.  They are now hunted to keep their numbers down and much of the vegetation is recovering.  On the other hand, South Manitous plant life is fairly representative of what the mainland was like before farming and deer grazing.  The trees are mostly beech and maple, with a stand of huge white cedars (one fallen specimen was over 500 years old) and yew growing in the underbrush.  Trillium (which are protected) grow on both islands, along with many other spring wildflowers and orchids.</field>

		<field name="content">The park lies at 45° North, halfway between the always-frozen pole and the always-warm equator.  Although Lake Michigan moderates temperatures somewhat, summers are hot (sometimes over 90°F by day) and winters are cold (sometimes below 0°F).  The vast water reservoir to the west means the heat is humid and the cold is snowy.  Sunscreen and footwear to protect you from hot sand is essential in the summer.  Spring comes fairly late, the chill of autumn can come early, and weather coming off the big lake can change conditions quickly, so dressing in layers is a good idea.</field>

Once known as the home base of Irish gangsters Whitey Bulger, James "Buddy" McLean, Howie Winter and the notorious Winter Hill Gang, Winter Hill is now, like much of the rest of Somerville, experiencing gentrification and a resulting rise in property values and rents. Despite these changes, the area continues to hang onto its neighborhood flavor and is home to a large community of Irish, Italians, Brazilians, Portuguese, Cape Verdeans, and other ethnic groups.  Davis Square, This is a great late-night summer hangout, especially given that J.P. Licks is here.  (J.P. Licks is a trendy local ice cream shop, also seen on Newbury Street in Boston.)  Its right on the Red Line, and also a major bus transfer point.  Tons of college folk linger in the brick plaza.  The Somerville Theatre doubles as a movie house (showing first- and second-run films, as well as arthouse fare) and music venue.  The basement level of the Somerville Theatre also houses the "Museum of Bad Art," (MoBA), a small and profoundly eclectic collection that never fails to astonish.  Davis Square has several coffeehouses, most notably the locally owned Diesel Cafe on Elm Street, that draw people day and night.   Teele Square, Just up the street from Davis Square (heading west) it has a lot to offer in way of local restaurants.  Its less crowded than Davis Square and less trendy.  Head up this way if youre looking for good subs and pizza (Angelinas), Mexican food (Rudys), or multi-ethnic Mediterranean fare from the Balkans and beyond (Sabur).  Union Square, It is not on the Red Line, so its a bit off the beaten path.  It is only a 15 minute walk from the Sullivan Square Orange Line station, and there are MBTA    buses arriving from Central, Harvard, Porter, Davis, Lechmere, and Sullivan Square T stops.  (Its a nice walk in good weather from the West, but the neighborhoods to the East are less nice.)  There are a number of Brazilian restaurants and stores around, including a Brazilian butcher-slash-convenience store.  The Brazilian community extends to Inman Square (Cambridge) and theres another pocket in Allston.  Theres also Indian, Mexican, and Peruvian fare here.  The Sherman Cafe and Bloc 11 cafe are two excellent locally-owned coffee houses.  Sherman Market sells local produce.  Union Square is a nice, brick-based New England intersection of many roads.  Ongoing improvements to the square include benches created by local artists.  As of mid-2010, major reconstruction of Somerville Avenue (as it travels from Porter Square to Union Square) is nearing completion, bringing with it an improved streetscape with better lighting, more traffic lights, and raised pedestrian crosswalks.  The Brickbottom Artists Studios are just outside of Union Square, under the McGrath Highway.</field>

		<field name="content">The inside of slave quarters in Virginia  The region known as The South comprises—more or less—those states that seceded from the  United States  in 1861, precipitating the American Civil War.  Upset with a growing sentiment against slavery, eleven slave-holding states seceded after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, forming the Confederate States of America.  What ensued was a bloody five-year conflict that left the country bruised and battered but ultimately resulted in the preservation of the nation and the abolition of slavery.  Most of the major battles occurred on Southern soil, and the South was devastated as a result of the war.  The South existed for over two hundred years before the American Civil War.  It was first settled at Roanoke Island in 1585, and the first permanent settlement was at Jamestown in 1607.  Many of the early settlers in the South were indentured servants, and later slaves.  Many Revolutionary War battles were fought in the South, including the Battle of Yorktown which effectively ended the war.  By 1800, the Southern economy focused on the growing of tobacco (in Virginia, Tennessee and the Carolinas) and cotton (elsewhere) as "cash crops", and did not industrialize in the early 19th century as the North did.  At the time of the American Civil War, one in three Southerners was an African slave.  Most of the rest of the Southerners were white farmers who were poor and owned no slaves, but a few owned large amounts of land and slaves.  After the American Civil War, people in the South struggled to cope with defeat.  Although Southern blacks were free, they remained second-class citizens.  They were often denied the vote, and many were forced to work the land as sharecroppers.  Segregation laws (called "Jim Crow") were rampant in the South.  Many white Southerners fought against desegregation and equality for blacks until well into the 20th century.  Some of them formed a group called the Ku Klux Klan, which terrorized blacks and immigrants.   Texas  and  Florida  also seceded from the union but are considered distinct regions today.   Kentucky  and  West Virginia  are sometimes considered Southern states, and did hold slaves at the time of the Civil War, but Kentucky never completely seceded, and West Virginia seceded from Virginia in 1863 in order to rejoin the Union.   Maryland  and  Delaware  also had slaves but did not secede, and are today considered part of the  Mid-Atlantic  travel region.  Very few Southerners remain loyal to any secessionist or slave-holding ideology, and most identify first and foremost as Americans.  The display of Confederate (or "rebel") flags around the region, still quite common, is a mark of cultural identity, not normally a political statement.  As a whole, white Southerners tend to be more Republican and more libertarian than Americans as a whole.  Indeed, the South is much more a cultural region than a geographical one; states west of Texas are not considered part of "The South", no matter how far south they are.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">South Dakota’s history is filled with rich heritage and colorful characters that include the likes of Lewis and Clark, Sitting Bull, Wild Bill Hickok, Crazy Horse and Laura Ingalls Wilder. The land is the home of several Plains Indian tribes, including the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota-speaking people of the Great Sioux Nation.   By the early 1700s, French fur traders had extended their interests into the Upper Mississippi River basin. French Canadian explorers, Louis Joseph and Francois la Verendrye, were the first known non-Indians in what we call South Dakota. They left a lead plate in 1743 on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River in present day Fort Pierre claiming the region for France. This land was transferred to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase, and in 1804, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark met with the Teton band of the Lakota people in the same vicinity. In 1831, Pierre Chouteau, Jr. founded an American Fur Trading post in the area known as Fort Pierre. Today, the cities of Fort Pierre and Pierre (the state capital), take their names from this fort.   The discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874 helped fuel a population boom in the last half of the 19th century. The largest find was near the town of present day Lead – a claim that would yield gold for more than 120 years. Deadwood was perhaps the wildest gold camp to spring from the rush – the town’s sordid early days even inspired an HBO television series. Deadwood was home to Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, both of whom were laid to rest in Mount Moriah Cemetery, along with Sheriff Seth Bullock.   Fighting over the mineral-rich and culturally-sacred land raged between native Sioux tribes and settlers in the late 1800s. The final major conflict during the Plains Indian Wars occurred on December 29, 1890, at the Massacre of Wounded Knee, in southwest South Dakota.   During this time, pioneers and homesteaders were beginning to form South Dakota’s strong agricultural base, still prevalent in the state economy today. “Little House on the Prairie” author Laura Ingalls Wilder documented the pioneer spirit in her beloved books about growing up on the prairie. Four of her six books were written about her family’s adventures in De Smet. Today, you can tour her childhood homestead and see places that inspired her classic books and a television series.   South Dakota also played a key role in the Cold War. In the 1960s, America began installing Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles beneath western prairies. The 44th Missile Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota operated 150 missile silos and 15 launch control facilities in the western part of the state. Two of these sites, the Delta One Launch Control Facility and the Delta Nine Launch Facility, have been preserved as a National Historic Site to provide visitors with a unique Cold War history lesson.</field>

		<field name="content">Spartanburg, SC Weather Facts  On average, the warmest month is July.  The highest recorded temperature was 106°F in 1986.  On average, the coolest month is January.  The lowest recorded temperature was -5°F in 1985.  The maximum average precipitation occurs in March. Spartanburg is not as well equipped for snow and ice as more northerly cities; significant accumulations of snow (more than 2cm) or ice on the roads can disrupt activity city-wide. Usually, this includes the closing of local businesses and schools, and happens about once a year on average. Spartanburgs inland location usually protects it from being hit directly from Atlantic hurricanes, though it often receives heavy rains due to passing tropical systems.</field>

		<field name="content">A treaty struck with the Cherokee Indian nation in 1753 opened SC’s frontier to settlers.  The county has a proude Revolutionary war heritage, boasting more engagement sites than practically any locale in the US.  After capturing Charleston in 1780, the Redcoats might have secured  victory had they not so savagely  violated their own terms for surrender.  Subjected to slaughter, torture and humiliation, the rebel patriots fought back with a vengeance.   The Spartanburg area saw six engagements in four weeks, beginning in July with the Battle of Cedar Springs.  The battles of Gowen’s Fort, Earle’s Ford and Fort Prince immediately followed, leading to a second battle at Cedar Spring and the Battle of Musgrove Mill.   Two critical engagements altered the course of the war.  At the Battle of King’s Mountain 160 loyalists were killed and 760 taken prisoner.  Three months later, the American’s led by General Daniel Morgan, trounced their British opponents in the monumental Battle of Cowpens. Following the fighting, more settlements grew up in the area nad the new district began to form its own government.  A new courthouse was built in the middle of the county and the town of Spartanburg was born, named after the Spartanburg Reginment formed at the beginning of the war. The town incorporated in 1831, and the city’s industry was flourishing by the middle of the century. It became known as “Hub City” because it’s many railroads gave it a look of a wheel hub on maps.   Major textile expansion began in 1877 and between 1880 and 1910, industrialists built nearly 40 textile mills in the area and, at one time, the county boasted over a half-million spindles.  World War I hit and over 4,000 of the city’s natives served, nearly 2,897 of whom were drafted.  Over 100,000 men from across the country trained at Camp Wadsworth, west of the city.  During the second World War, over 200,000 soldiers were trained at Camp Croft, just south of the city, while 18,000 of the county’s men served in battle.  The camp’s $2.5 million-payroll further strengthened Spartanburg’s economy.   The end of WWII marked the slow decline of the mill village as rising wages and the auto-boom of the 1950s spread Spartanburg residents throughout the city.  By the end of the decade, mill society was pretty much history.   In the 1970s, a new economic boom arrived in the form of international industry taking us into the 21st century.</field>

		<field name="content">Springfields Metro Center is the highly walkable, cultural and business heart of the Pioneer Valley - a region of approximately 40 miles by 20 miles that follows the path of the Connecticut River and contains New Englands finest farmland. It stretches from the border of Vermont in the north to the border of Connecticut in the south. Springfields Metro Center is located only 4 miles north of the Connecticut state border, and thus increasingly - in both governmental and popular perception - Hartford-Springfield is considered a single metropolitan area, (e.g. like Dallas-Fort Worth.) The two major Connecticut River cities downtowns lie only 23.9 (35km) apart, with Bradley International Airport located halfway between them.  Metro Center features The Quadrangle, which includes three world-class museums - two art and one science museum - two regional history museums, the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden, and the palatial, neo-classical Springfield City Library. Metro Center is also home to the Springfield Symphony Orchestra (SSO) at Symphony Hall; the highly-regarded CityStage theater; and 60 clubs, restaurants, and bars in its lively Club Quarter, surrounding Stearns Square and Worthington Street. Unfortunately, Metro Center is bisected by Interstate 91, which limits access to the scenic Connecticut River.  The Basketball Hall of Fame is located on the riverfront in the nearby South End, but amputated from Metro Center and the rest of the city by Interstate 91. (In 2010, the Urban Land Institute debuted a plan to unite the Basketball Hall of Fame and the Connecticut River with Metro Center and the South End; however, as of 2011, no action has been taken.) The South End is the focal point for Springfields Italian community, featuring many Italian restaurants, pastry shops, and cultural institutions. Unfortunately, the South End was hard hit by Springfields June 1, 2011 tornado.  The North End comprises three separate neighborhoods, and is the center of Springfields prominent and increasingly well-heeled Latino community. Springfields three nationally ranked hospitals are located in the North End, as are several prominent parks (e.g. Van Horn Park.)  The McKnight District - known to urban planners worldwide as the United States first planned residential district (1871) - contains over 900. Victorian "Painted Lady" houses. For decades it was the center Springfields African-American and Jamaican communities; however, increasingly, both McKnight and Metro Center have become centers of Springfields increasingly prominent LGBT community. In 2011, The Advocate magazine rated Springfield 13 among the United States new "gay cities."  Forest Park and Forest Park Heights contain numerous Victorian mansions, many of which surround Frederick Law Olmsteds 735-acre Forest Park -- one of the largest urban parks in the United States. This is where architectural aficionados should head to learn why Springfield is nicknamed "The City of Homes," as it features many parkways and elegant houses. Forest Park - the Olmsted park itself - contains a small but extensive zoo, a skating rink, 38 tennis courts, numerous sculptures, walking and hiking trails, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, tree groves, Victorian promenades and water gardens, a formal rose garden, paddle-boating and fishing on the 31-acre Porter Lake, bocce courts, lawn bowling fields, and The Barney Mansion restaurant and banquet hall, among other features.</field>

		<field name="content">St. Augustine has a humid subtropical climate, with mild weather during winters and hot weather during summers. High temperatures average 64 to 91 °F (18-33 °C) throughout the year. High heat indices are not uncommon for the summer months in the St. Augustine area. High temperatures can reach mid to high 90s with heat index ranges of 105-115 °F. It is common for daily thunderstorms to erupt during a standard summer afternoon. These are caused by the heating of the land and water, combined with extremely high humidity.  During winter, the area can experience hard freezes during the night. Such cold weather is usually short lived, as the city averages only 15 nights below freezing. Even rarer in St. Augustine than freezing temperatures is snow. When snow does fall, it usually melts before touching the ground, or upon making contact with the ground. Most residents of St. Augustine can remember accumulated snow on only one occasion—a thin ground cover that occurred a few days before Christmas of 1989.   St. Augustine has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities. The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871, although St. Augustine has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms passing through the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area. The strongest effect on St. Augustine was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane force winds.   Rainfall averages around 50 inches a year, with the wettest months being June through September.</field>

West Tampa, once a separate city, lies across the Hillsborough River to the west of Downtown. South Tampa, a large residential area, extends south along the Interbay Peninsula. Historic Ybor City (sometimes considered a part of downtown) lies on the northeast side of downtown. East Tampa, the historically African-American side of the city, lies north of Ybor City. North Tampa forms the urban/suburban sprawl north of Busch Boulevard. A significant suburban area, often considered a part of "Tampa", extends many miles to the northwest, north, and east of the city.  Within Tampa proper, there are six official "historical districts" (Hampton Terrace, Hyde Park, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Historic West Tampa, Ybor City) and at least 86 named neighborhoods.</field>

		<field name="content">The Tampa Bay area was visited by many Spanish explorers, beginning with Panfilo de Narvaez in 1528.  However, no long term permanent settlements were created until 1824 when the US federal government created a reservation for north Florida Seminole Indians.  At the same time, the US created Fort Brooke to oversee the reservation as well as protect the strategic harbor.    The 1880s saw the towns first population boom.  In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the area, spurring the development of the mining and shipping industries in the area.  Shortly after, Henry B. Plant completed work on his railroad linking Tampa to Jacksonville.  He began promoting Tampa as a holiday spot and built the grand Plant Hotel as a luxury resort destination.  In 1886, Vicente Martinez Ybor opened Tampas first cigar factory in Ybor City which encouraged the immigration of many Spanish, Cuban and Italian (primarily Sicilian) workers. During the Spanish American War at the turn of the century, Tampa was the main port of departure for troops heading for Cuba.  During this time, the Plant Hotel was converted into officers accommodations, housing the Rough Riders and Teddy Roosevelt.  In more recent times, MacDill Air Force Base was created in 1939 and the University of South Florida in 1956.  Over the course of the Twentieth Century, Tampa has grown into the center of a large metropolitan area; it now hosts the regional headquarters of many international companies, has acquired numerous professional sports teams, and has even bid for the summer Olympics.</field>

		<field name="content">Tampa is a very diverse city.  The first residents were the members of the Seminole Indian tribe that was relocated there from northern Florida and the soldiers stationed at Fort Brook to control the reservation.  The town remained a mostly military town until the 1880s when Tampa saw its first major waves of immigration from Cuba, Spain and Sicily. The major growth of the area did not occur until air conditioning became common in the years after World War II, but the region has been growing steadily since then.  Tampa is now home to many native Floridians, including Seminoles, Cubans, Spaniards and Italians, as well the residence of many transplants from the Midwest and other areas of the states and new immigrants from the Caribbean and central America.  Tampas population swells during the winter months with the arrival of the snowbirds, retired persons from the northern U.S. and Canada who come down for a few months to enjoy the relative warmth.</field>

In West Texas and the Panhandle, summers are usually dry with fits of stormy weather.  North (Dallas/Fort Worth region) and coastal (Houston region) areas have unstable climates (hence the oft-repeated saying about Texas weather: "If you dont like the weather, wait 10 minutes" ndash; though 10 minutes later you might not like the change).  Thunderstorms are common, sometimes generating tornadoes and hailstorms. It is often warmer near the coast, though humidity can be unbearable in the summer. Conversely, the spring, autumn and winter are relatively pleasant for most of the state. It rarely dips below the freezing point in winter, except in the Panhandle region where the winters can get quite cold ( Lubbock  and  Amarillo  have suffered devastating blizzards in the past), and, though it is quite rare, even points as far south as Corpus Christi and Brownsville have seen snow.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">"Timpanogos Cave" is actually three separate caves that are connected by man-made tunnels: Hansen Cave, Middle Cave, and Timpanogos Cave.  Hansen Cave was the first to be discovered, in 1887, by Martin Hansen.  Legend holds that he was tracking a cougar while armed with nothing more than an ax, and the animals tracks led him to the caves entrance.  While undeterred by the thought of facing a cougar armed with only an ax, the caves discoverer nevertheless decided not to venture into the darkness of a cave without additional protection, so he returned the next day with a torch and made the first exploration of the cave.  In the following years Hansen began leading tours of the cave, and sadly many of this caves formations were damaged by some of these early visitors.  The second cave, Timpanogos Cave was actually discovered twice, the first time by a pair of fourteen year old boys in 1915, and six years later the cave was rediscovered by the Payson Outdoors Club.  The discovery of Middle Cave came in the autumn of 1921 when Martin Hansens grandsons spotted the cave entrance with binoculars while searching for deer.  They explored the opening a few days later with their now 74-year-old grandfather leading the way.  Due to the dramatic formations found within the caves it was immediately understood that special protection was needed, and in 1922 President Warren Harding declared them a national monument.  The current cave trail was built in the ensuing years, and drilling commenced in the 1930s to connect the three caves.  Since that time protections have been tightened, and today numerous restrictions are in place to further protect the cave formations from the 70,000 annual visitors.</field>

		<field name="content">Timpanogos Cave National Monument consists of 250 acres within the steeply-walled American Fork Canyon. The elevation ranges from 5,000 feet to 9,500 feet. In the center of the monument flows the American Fork River.  The cave system is uniquely known for its high abundance of helictites, its coloration in its formations, its display of fault-controlled passages, and its alpine surroundings.  In the Chimes Chamber there are hundreds of 6 to 10 inch long helictites, which are spiral formations that seem to defy gravity. These formations are created by capillarity attraction, hydrostatic pressure, and tiny (0.008 to 0.5 millimeter) central canals. In simpler words water is pushed and pulled through small opening where the forces of capillarity attraction and hydrostatic pressure are greater than the force of gravity.  Timpanogos Caves abundance in helictites is thought to be caused by the large amounts of wall coatings and the small amount of fault movement that creates many small openings suitable for helictites.  The cave also contains formations displaying colors of green and yellow. X-ray analysis shows this rare green and yellow coloring to be from nickel being incorporated into the crystal structure.  The x-ray analysis of the yellow flowstone reveals only calcite, and the green flowstone is from mainly aragonite.  The passages in Timpanogos Cave are greatly controlled by faulting. Looking at a map of Timpanogos Cave, one sees many paralleling passages following the fault trends. Along the cave tour, visitors can see these fault lines running along the passages.  In some areas of the cave like the Imagination Room, passages dip along the bedding planes and follow the direction of the fault lines.  Looking at the map of the cave, one wonders if other cave passages exists following similar fault lines.    Timpanogos Cave is surrounded by an alpine environment. Unlike other tourist caves, this alpine remoteness is unique and escapes the polluted air and contaminated watersheds that plague other caverns. The cave is closed for 6 months due to heavy snowfalls; the cold environment allows the cave to keep a low stable 45 °F (7 °C) temperature year-round.</field>

The canyon also supports small mammals such as ringtail cats, longtail weasels, raccoons, squirrels, chipmunks, packrats, and bats.  Reptiles seen during summer months include the Great Basin rattlesnake, gopher snake, rubber boa, and sage lizard.  The American Fork River supports 2 species of introduced fish, brown trout and rainbow trout.   Birdlife in the canyon includes commonly seen birds such as the American dipper, broad-tailed hummingbird, canyon wren, orange-crowned warbler, western tanager, violet-green swallow, and stellers jays. Occassional visits are seen from large birds such as red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcon, and golden eagles.</field>

		<field name="content">The contiguous United States or "Lower 48" (the 48 states other than Alaska and Hawaii) are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west and Gulf of Mexico to the south, with much of the population living on these three coasts. Its only land borders are shared with  Canada  to the north, and  Mexico  to the south. The U.S. also shares maritime borders with  Russia ,  Cuba , and the  Bahamas .  The country has three major mountain ranges.  The  Appalachians  extend from Canada to the state of  Alabama , a few hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean.  They are the oldest of the three mountain ranges and offer spectacular sightseeing and excellent camping spots.  The  Rockies  are, on average, the highest in North America, extending from Alaska to  New Mexico , with many areas protected as national parks. They offer hiking, camping, skiing, and sightseeing opportunities.  The combined  Sierra Nevada  and Cascade ranges are the youngest. The Sierras extend across the "backbone" of  California , with sites such as  Lake Tahoe  and  Yosemite National Park , then give way to the even younger volcanic Cascade range, with some of the highest points in the country.  The Gulf of Mexico borders the states of  Texas  to the west,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama , and  Florida  to the east.  The  Great Lakes  define much of the border between the eastern United States and Canada.  More fresh water inland seas than lakes, they were formed by the pressure of glaciers retreating north at the end of the last Ice Age.  The five lakes span hundreds of miles, bordering the states of  Minnesota ,  Wisconsin ,  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Michigan ,  Ohio ,  Pennsylvania  and  New York , and their shores vary from pristine wilderness areas to industrial "rust belt" cities. They are the second-largest bodies of freshwater in the world, after the polar ice caps.   Grand Tetons ,  Rocky Mountains ,  Wyoming  ]]</field>

		<field name="content">The overall climate is temperate, with notable exceptions. Alaska has Arctic tundra, while Hawaii,  South Florida , Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are tropical. The  Great Plains  are dry, flat and grassy, turning into arid desert in the far West and Mediterranean along the California coast.  In the winter, the northern and mid-western major cities can see as much as 2 feet (61nbsp;cm) of snowfall in one day, with cold temperatures.  Summers are humid, but mild. Temperatures over 100nbsp;°F (38nbsp;°C) sometimes invade the  Midwest and Great Plains. Some areas in the northern plains can experience cold temperatures of minus;30nbsp;°F (minus;34nbsp;°C) during the winter. Temperatures below 0nbsp;°F (minus;18nbsp;°C) sometimes reach as far south as  Oklahoma .  The climate of the  South  also varies. In the summer, it is hot and humid, but from October through April the weather can range from 60nbsp;°F (15nbsp;°C) to short cold spells of 20nbsp;°F (minus;7nbsp;°C) or so.  The Great Plains and  Midwestern  states also experience tornadoes from the late spring to early fall, earlier in the south and later in the north. States along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico may experience hurricanes between June and November.  These intense and dangerous storms frequently miss the U.S. mainland, but evacuations are often ordered and should be heeded.  The Rockies are cold and snowy. Some parts of the Rockies see over 500 inches (1,200nbsp;cm) of snow in a season. Even during the summer, temperatures are cool in the mountains, and snow can fall nearly year-round. It is dangerous to go up in the mountains unprepared in the winter and the roads through them can get very icy.  The deserts of the  Southwest  are hot and dry during the summer, with temperatures often exceeding 100nbsp;°F (38nbsp;°C). Thunderstorms can be expected in the southwest frequently from July through September. Winters are mild, and snow is unusual. Average annual precipitation is low, usually less than 10 inches (25nbsp;cm).  Cool and damp weather is common much of the year in the coastal northwest (Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade Range, and the northern part of California west of the Coast Ranges/Cascades). Summers (July through September) are usually quite dry with low humidity, though, making it the ideal climate for outdoor activities. Rain is most frequent in winter, snow is rare, especially along the coast, and extreme temperatures are uncommon. Rain falls almost exclusively from late fall through early spring along the coast. East of the Cascades, the northwest is considerably drier. Much of the inland northwest is either semi-arid or desert, though altitude and weather patterns may result in wetter climates in some areas.  Northeastern and cities of the Upper South are known for summers with temperatures reaching into the 90s (32nbsp;°C) or more, with extremely high humidity, usually over 80%.  This can be a drastic change from the Southwest. High humidity means that the temperature can feel hotter than actual readings. The Northeast also experiences snow, and at least once every few years there will be a dumping of the white stuff in enormous quantities.</field>

		<field name="content">Native Americans, or American Indians, probably emerged tens of thousands of years ago from migrating northeast Asian peoples. Stereotypes of their primitiveness misrepresent the wide variety of sophisticated societies that existed before the first arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century. For example, the Cherokee built huge mounds and large towns that covered the Southeast, and the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. These societies were decimated by Old-World diseases such as smallpox; their broken remnants led the simple existences of the stereotype.  European colonization began in the 16th and 17th centuries.  England ,  Spain , and  France  gained large holdings; the  Netherlands ,  Sweden , and  Russia  also established outposts. The first English colonies, founded in  Jamestown ,  Virginia  (1607) and  Plymouth ,  Massachusetts  (1620), formed the kernel of what is now known as the United States of America.  In the North, Massachusetts was first settled by religious immigrantsmdash;Puritansmdash;who later spread and founded most of the other New England colonies, creating a highly religious and idealistic region. Other religious groups also founded colonies, including the Quakers in  Pennsylvania  and Roman Catholics in  Maryland . The Middle Colonies of  New York ,  New Jersey ,  Delaware  and  Pennsylvania  became the Norths cosmopolitan center.  Longer growing seasons in the Southern colonies, which remained dominated by Virginia, gave them richer agricultural prospects, especially for cotton and tobacco. As in Latin America and the Caribbean, indentured servants and later African slaves were imported and forced to cultivate large plantations. Slavery was initially legal in both North and South, but its greater importance to the Souths economy would eventually cause tremendous upheaval.   Independence Hall in Philadelphia  was where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted]] By the early 18th century, Great Britain had colonized the Atlantic coast from  Georgia  north into what is now Canada. Britains dominance in North America was established in 1763 after the global Seven Years War. In part to finance the North American campaigns of the war, known as the French and Indian War, Britain imposed unpopular taxes and regulations on its colonists. This precipitated revolution in 1775 and on 4 July 1776, colonists from 13 colonies declared full independence. The Revolutionary War lasted until 1783, when the new United States of America formally took control of all British land between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River.  Wrangling over the formation of a national government lasted until 1787 when a constitution was agreed upon. Its Enlightenment-era ideas about individual liberty have since inspired the founding decrees of many states. George Washington, the leader of the revolutionary forces, was elected the first president. By the turn of the 19th century, the newly-built  Washington, D.C.  was established as the national capital.  New states were created as white settlers moved west beyond the Appalachian Mountains. The Native American populations were duly displaced and further harrowed by war and disease. The 1803 Louisiana Purchase of French lands to the west of the Mississippi effectively doubled the countrys area, and provided "Indian Territory" in what is now Oklahoma for the many Native American tribes from the east that were forcibly relocated during the Trail of Tears of the 1830s.  An attempt to rout British loyalists from Canada led to the War of 1812. There were over two years of dramatic action on land and sea that included the burning of the White House, Capitol, and other public buildings in Washington, DC. The final stalemate saw virtually no changes of territory, but the war galvanized separate American and Canadian identities. The national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner", was conceived during the war. Western Native American tribes that had sided with the British suffered greatly as their territory was given to white settlers.  After the war, industry and infrastructure were expanded greatly, particularly in the Northeast. Roads and canals came first and helped people spread inland. In 1825, the  Erie Canal  connected the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. By the 1860s, railroads and telegraph lines connected the east and west coasts via the industrial hub of  Chicago  in the  Midwest . In the early 19th century, a series of religious revivals, the Second Great Awakening, led to various reform movements that strove for goals such as temperance, the abolition of slavery, and womens suffrage.   The 1836 Battle of the Alamo (San Antonio ,  Texas ) was a crucial moment of the Texas Revolution.]] U.S. expansion south and west chipped away at Spanish and Mexican territory. Spain sold  Florida  in 1813 after American military intervention; and an 1836 rebellion by American settlers in Mexican Texas founded an independent republic which was absorbed into the Union ten years later. This sparked the Mexican–American War in which Mexico lost what is now  California ,  Nevada ,  Utah ,  Arizona , and  New Mexico , and the continental United States essentially assumed its modern outline. Native Americans were relegated to reservations and continued to be purged by treaty, military force, and disease from settlers on the Oregon Trail and other westward routes.  Federal governance was light and the individual states were highly autonomous. By the 1850s, there was irreconcilable disparity between the industrialized and more urban Northern states, which had all outlawed slavery within three decades of the revolution, and the plantation-dependent rural South. The North wanted to impose a national ban on the expansion of slavery, while the Southern states sought to expand slavery into new territories. In 1861, eleven Southern states, fearful of marginalization and the avowedly anti-slavery President Abraham Lincoln, broke from the Union and formed an independent Confederate States of America. The ensuing American Civil War remains the bloodiest conflict on American soil and killed hundreds of thousands. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, firmly cementing the federal governments authority over the states. Slavery was abolished nationwide and the Confederate states were re-admitted into the Union during a period of Reconstruction. The former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South.  Russia sold its tenuously held Alaskan territory in 1867, and the previously independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898. The United States decisive victory over Spain in the 1898 Spanish–American War gained it colonial territories:  Cuba  (granted independence a few years later), the  Philippines  (granted independence shortly after World War II),  Puerto Rico , and  Guam  (which remain American dependencies).  In the late 19th and into the 20th century, Southern and Eastern Europeans, Russian Jews, and Irish refugees bolstered the continuing industrialization of the eastern cities by providing cheap labor. Many Southern African-Americans fled rural poverty for industrial jobs in the North. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to newly opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was given to anyone who would develop it.  The United States entrance into World War I in 1917 marked the start of an era it would ultimately dominate politically. However, soon after the victory the U.S. eschewed international involvement and refused to join the nascent League of Nations, effectively crippling the organization. Real wealth grew rapidly and the Roaring 20s saw stock speculation that created an immense "bubble" which burst in 1929, leading to the global economic havoc of the Great Depression. The resulting privation fostered a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in the coming conflict.  It also ushered in Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his "New Deal", a series of government programs that constructed thousands of buildings and bridges across the country while creating the basis of the American welfare state.   The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor ]] In 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, a Hawaiian naval base, plunging the United States into World War II alongside British, Soviet, and Chinese allies. The U.S. developed atomic bombs and dropped them twice on Japan in 1945, abruptly ending the war. By the end of the war, the United States had firmly established itself as the worlds dominant economic power, responsible for nearly half of global industrial production.  The subsequent nuclear-armed Cold War saw the United States and the Soviet Union jostle for power while courting their own mutually assured destruction.  For the century after the Civil War, blacks were not equal citizens. Discrimination was particularly rife in the South. In the 1950s a civil rights movement emerged which vehemently, but largely peacefully, vied for equal rights. With Martin Luther King, Jr., a charismatic preacher, as its figurehead the movement came to a head in 1963 when 200,000–300,000 people flooded the capital to listen to him. A revived womens movement in the 1960s also led to wide-ranging changes in American society.  Postwar America was characterized by affluence and industrialization. People left agriculture  and moved to the cities to become part of an increasingly technology-based economy. American car culture emerged in the 1950s and was supported by the construction of a comprehensive Interstate Highway System. The American consumer culture, as well as Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music, arguably established the United States as the cultural center of the world. The U.S. has also grown into one of the worlds major centres of higher education, being home to some of the worlds most prestigious universities, and attracting more international students than any other country in the world.</field>

		<field name="content">The United States is a federal republic. Its major constituents are the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.); it also has various island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific that are strongly – but often not fully – integrated into the union. Many of these territories are within the U.S. customs and immigration area and so for practical purposes can be considered part of the U.S. (See  Travel to U.S. possessions ).  The federal government derives its power from the Constitution, which is the oldest written constitution in continuous use. Within the overarching federal laws, each state maintains its own constitution, government and laws, and so retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State laws can vary in their details but are, for the most part, fairly uniform from state to state.  The President is elected every four years and is the head of the federal government as well as head of state. His administration forms the executive branch. The bicameral Congress (comprising the lower House of Representatives and the upper Senate) constitutes the legislative branch. The Supreme Court tops the judicial branch. State governments are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries.  Two major political parties have dominated at both state and federal levels since the end of the Civil War: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. While smaller political parties exist, the winner-take-all electoral system means that they rarely succeed at any level.</field>

		<field name="name">culture</field>
		<field name="content">The Souths famous Bourbon Street,  New Orleans ,  Louisiana   The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and the culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities – a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal responsibility and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but there are many exceptions and that a nation as diverse as the United States has literally thousands of distinct cultural traditions. One will find Mississippi in the South to be very different culturally from Massachusetts in the North.  Religion is very important in the United States. Only 20% of people in the United States identify with no religion, which is very low in comparison to other Western nations. Roughly one-quarter of Americans are Roman Catholic, and one-half of them are Protestant, with Protestantism being further broken down into mainline, Evangelical and Pentecostal sects. There are much smaller numbers of Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and a host of other religions. Because of many Americans strong religious belief, many businesses and institutions are closed on Sundays, and a number of areas in the South and Midwest forbid certain actions from taking place on Sunday.  Overall, while the United States is less religious than many other nations, it is more religious than  Canada  and  Northern Europe ; however, this trend varies greatly by region, with the  Pacific Northwest  and  New England  being largely secular and the  American South  being extraordinarily Christian, particularly Evangelical. Differences in religiosity largely correlate with politics, too, so the Northeast and West Coast are generally liberal and Democratic; most of the South and heavily Mormon states like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming are very conservative and Republican; and much of the rest of the country (e.g., several Midwestern, Southwestern/Rocky Mountain, and Southern coastal states) is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.</field>

		<field name="name">holidays</field>
		<field name="content">There are no nationwide, mandatory public holidays. Federal holidays are the most centrally coordinated holidays, but they are only officially recognized by the federal government; federal offices, banks, and post offices close on these days. Nearly all states and localities also observe these holidays, as well as a handful of their own. If a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance will normally be shifted to the nearest weekday.  The time between late November and January 1 has such a high concentration of major holidays that it is often simply called "the holidays." School and work vacations are commonly taken during this period.  In the list below, federal holidays are listed in bold italics.  New Years Day (1 January) — most non-retail businesses closed; parades; brunches and football parties. Martin Luther King Day (third Monday in January) — many government offices and banks closed; speeches, especially on African-American history and culture. Chinese New Year (January/February — varies based on the Chinese lunar calendar) — Chinese cultural celebration. Super Bowl Sunday (usu. first Sunday in February) — The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the NFL American football league and the most-watched sporting event of the year; supermarkets, bars, and electronics stores busy; big football-watching parties. (St.) Valentines Day (14 February) — private celebration of romance and love. Most restaurants are crowded; finer restaurants may require reservations made well in advance. Presidents Day (third Monday in February; officially Washingtons Birthday) — many government offices and banks closed; many stores have sales. St. Patricks Day (17 March) — Irish-themed parades and parties. Expect bars to be crowded. They will often feature themed drink specials. The wearing of green clothes or accessories is common. Easter (a Sunday in March or April) — Christian religious observances. Depending on location, many restaurants, including franchised outlets of major national chains, may close. Major retailers generally open; smaller shops may or may not close. Passover (varies based on the Jewish calendar, eight days around Easter) — Jewish religious observance. Cinco de Mayo (5 May) — A minor holiday in most of Mexico often incorrectly assumed to be Mexican independence day, but nevertheless a major cultural celebration for Mexican-Americans. As with St. Patricks Day, expect bars to be crowded, frequently with themed drink specials. Memorial Day (last Monday in May) — most non-retail businesses closed; some patriotic observances; trips to beaches and parks; traditional beginning of summer tourism season. Independence Day / Fourth of July (4 July) — most non-retail businesses closed; patriotic parades and concerts, cookouts and trips to beaches and parks, fireworks at dusk. Labor Day (first Monday in September) — most non-retail businesses closed; cookouts and trips to beaches and parks; many stores have sales; traditional ending of summer tourism season. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (varies based on the Jewish calendar, September or early October) — Jewish religious observances.  Columbus Day (second Monday in October) — many government offices and banks closed; some stores have sales.  Italian-themed parades in some cities. Columbus Day can be controversial, especially among Native Americans, and is not as widely observed as it was in the past. Halloween (31 October) — Children often go trick-or-treating (knocking on other houses doors to get candy and other treats.) There are spooky attractions, such as haunted corn mazes and costume parties. Veterans Day (11 November) — government offices and banks closed; some patriotic observances. Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November) — almost all businesses closed, including grocery stores and many restaurants; family dinners. The next day, known as "Black Friday," major Christmas shopping traditionally begins. Many non-retail employees are given Friday off or take it as a holiday. Hanukkah / Chanukah (varies based on the Jewish calendar, eight days usually in December) — Jewish religious observance, often culturally associated with Christmas. Christmas (25 December) — almost all businesses, grocery stores, and many restaurants closed the evening before and all day. Families and close friends exchange gifts; Christian religious observances. Kwanzaa (26 December – 1 January) — African-American cultural observance.  New Years Eve (31 December) — many restaurants and bars open late; lots of parties, especially in big cities.  All U.S. embassies are closed on the federal holidays in addition to the holidays of the host country.</field>

		<field name="name">units of measure</field>
		<field name="content">The United States is the only industrialized country that eschews the metric system. Instead it uses "customary units" (feet, miles, gallons, pounds, etc.), which are largely derived from the English units of the 18th century, and are sometimes different from the imperial units that occasionally linger in Britain. Road distances are given in miles and speed limits in miles per hour. Gasoline and other liquids are sold per gallon, quart, or ounce (a U.S. gallon is 3.78 liters, so a U.S. quart  quarter gallon  is slightly less than a liter). Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit only; 32 degrees (with units unspecified) is freezing, not warm! Most cars speedometers show both miles and kilometers per hour (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all packaged foods and other products are labeled in both systems. Outside of scientific work, medicine and the military, there is little day-to-day exposure to the metric system, so Americans will assume you understand the U.S. customary measures.  There is no government regulation of clothes or shoe sizes. There are ill-enforced informal standards, and the only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. Therefore, trial and error is required for each brand to determine what fits, because you cannot count on any two brands sizes being equivalent.</field>

		<field name="name">when to visit</field>
		<field name="content">Utah has four distinct seasons and widely-variable climate zones. Summer is hot in the north (about 80°-100°F), but rarely extreme, and is often unbearable in the far southern valleys and desert terrain (often exceeding 100°F, and even 110°F). However, summers tend to be quite comfortable in the mountains, making summer an ideal time to experience the mountain terrain of Utah. In winter, temperatures from 20° - 40°F are common in the north, with warmer temperatures in the south. Overnight temps can occasionally drop below 0°F. Snow is common statewide, with the exception of the far southern valleys, from November - March, and often occurs even earlier and later than this. Snow is particularly common downwind of the Great Salt Lake, due to lake effect. A number of excellent ski resorts operate in the Wasatch Mountains, especially around Salt Lake City, from about late November through mid-April. Snow is common in the mountains from late September - May. Summer and fall are both excellent times to enjoy the mountain scenery, with comfortable temperatures, low chance of snow, and easy access to a number of fantastic trails and hiking paths.  Although snow is common in winter in much of the state, rain is less common - it can be expected in winter and spring in the south and in spring in the north, but its usually fairly light and short in duration. Fall also sees a short but unpredictable rainy season. Although summer is bone dry statewide, thunderstorms are a daily threat, especially throughout the south and in the northern mountains. Although these t-storms are short and small, they can be very intense. Although summer and fall are great times to enjoy the mountains and the slot canyons and desert terrain of southern Utah, attention must be paid to the skies as the evening approaches if camping in the mountains or enjoying the rugged terrain of southern Utah, especially in August. These storms can bring flash flooding to the narrow slot canyons of southern Utah, so make sure to evacuate the slot canyons as soon as possible if you see thunderstorms nearby - if you have a guide they will usually know when precautions must be taken. Summer and fall also bring a serious threat of wildfires in the backcountry.  September and early October is usually the best time to enjoy Utah, especially the mountains, with milder temperatures than summer, less chance of violent thunderstorms, and little chance of snow in the mountains. In addition, significant snowpack can linger in the mountains through May, while by early Autumn, summer has melted all of the snow, and snowstorms are rare. The national parks of Utah can get very crowded during Summer but predictably become less crowded towards late Summer and into Fall. Finally, Fall colors are spectacular in the mountains of Utah, and reach their peak in September. Colors in the valley peak in mid-October but arent especially spectacular. The gorgeous Fall colors in the mountains rival the famous colors of New England, and are sometimes accompanied by early snow, creating a unique and beautiful mixture of vibrant colors and soft white.</field>

		<field name="title">Valles Caldera National Preserve</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The Valles Caldera has had an unusual history that has given it a unique position among United States national parks.  After a long pre-history of occupation by ancestral Puebloans and later Spanish settlers, the caldera and the surrounding Jemez Mountains passed into United States control after the Mexican-American War.  At this time it wasnt viewed as particularly significant: a remote, if scenic, area of what seemed to be grazing land within a newly acquired territory, of little commercial interest to anyone but the old Spanish families that had already settled and pastured livestock there, sometimes in the face of considerable hostility from nearby Indian populations.  Consequently, when a bill was passed in the United States Congress in 1860 to compensate the Baca family, a pioneering family in New Mexico with significant land holdings, for the federalization of some of their land, a large tract of land in the Jemez, including most of the caldera, was handed over to the Bacas, along with some other tracts elsewhere in the Southwest.  This tract became known as "Baca Location No. 1" and would retain this name long after the Baca family sold it to other investors.  The Baca Location changed hands a few times in the 19th and 20th centuries before winding up in the hands of James P. (Pat) Dunigan, a wealthy Texan who had a good sense for the history and aesthetics of the property.  Dunigan was horrified by the environmental damage inflicted on his property by prior holders of the timber rights.  He therefore bought out the holders of those rights, and placed most of the Baca Location off limits to development while he negotiated with the United States government to sell the land back to the government under terms that guaranteed its preservation in perpetuity.  The negotiations literally took decades, but finally, in 1999, Congress authorized the acquisition of the Baca Location from Dunigans heirs, as he had died by this time.  The terms of the acquisition called for the resulting "Valles Caldera National Preserve" (VCNP) to differ from practically any other national park land in the United States, in two related senses.  First, in recognition of not only the history of the Baca Location but also the fact that the grazing there is economically significant to the region (which cannot exactly be called wealthy), Congress decreed that the Preserve would continue to function as a working ranch, and that it would eventually become self-sustaining through the revenues thus generated, even as resources for public recreational use came on-line.  Second, and as a result, management of the VCNP would be done via a "trust" that includes representatives of not only the agencies that contributed land to the Preserve but also members of nearby communities.  These factors together explain why visitor facilities have been slow in developing.  The beautiful terrain has led to the area being used as background for a number of movies (some quite recent), and old, decaying movie sets are scattered around the valleys.  Some are accessible via trail rides or hikes, but please dont touch; theyre scenic, but generally in such rickety shape as to be hazardous.</field>

		<field name="content">The terrain is volcanic with the caldera rim topping out at elevations around 10,500 feet.  (Chicoma Mountain (11,590) and a few other points along the northeastern rim reach over 11,000, but lie outside the Preserve, on the territory of Santa Clara Pueblo.)  The caldera itself has a base level at 8700 and is broken into a collection of valleys by resurgent domes and post-caldera eruptive centers.  The largest valley is the Valle Grande, on the southeast side of the caldera; the highest summit within the caldera, and the highest in the Preserve, is Redondo Peak, with a summit elevation above 11,200 feet.  Note that Redondo Peak is considered a sacred mountain by a number of the American Indian tribes of the region, and its summit is off limits to hikers.  El Cajete is a relatively recent (~60,000 years old?) eruptive center southwest of Valle Grande that is reachable by an attractive Nordic ski trail.  Most of the mountains in VCNP are fairly gentle, although there are a few basalt outcroppings that produce cliffs.  These cliffs are not yet open to the public for rock climbing, but similar formations in the surrounding  Santa Fe National Forest  and in nearby  Los Alamos  are popular attractions for the technical sport climber.  The territory outside the caldera features a vast region of eroded tuff known as the Pajarito Plateau, with spectacular canyon-mesa scenery.  Los Alamos is built on the Pajarito Plateau, and many of the formations canyons are preserved in  Bandelier National Monument  which abuts VCNP on the south.  The drive to VCNP from the east (Los Alamos) side shows this terrain to breathtakingly good advantage.</field>

New Mexicos largest herd of elk spends its summers in the Preserve, migrating to lower elevations for winter.  Deer and black bear are also encountered, and there are a few mountain lions, although they are almost never seen by visitors.  Smaller animals include the ubiquitous coyote, porcupine, skunk, raccoon, and all manner of rodents.  Birdwatching in VCNP is good, although not as diverse as along the nearby Rio Grande.  Many species of raptors are present and can often be seen perched on dead timber or gliding above the valleys looking for prey, as can black vultures.  Two of the most characteristic birds of VCNP, at opposite ends of the size scale, are the huge black ravens that compete for offal with the vultures, and several species of hummingbirds that may zing past you as you hike or ride.  The raptors, vultures and ravens are residents year-round, but the hummers are migratory and head south around the beginning of September.  There are few snakes in VCNP, as the elevation is too great for most of them.  However, timber rattlesnakes have been seen on occasion even near the top of the ski runs on Pajarito Mountain (elevation 10,409) on the eastern rim above Los Alamos.  The endangered Jemez Mountain salamander is present and could lead to occasional closures of parts of VCNP to preserve its habitat.  Trout swim in the streams that have their headwaters in the region, some of which are suitable for fishing (permit system).</field>

		<field name="content">Valles Caldera has a continental climate with four distinct seasons.  Winter weather is highly variable, with some years producing a great deal of snow (over four feet of snow has fallen in a single storm) and other years producing almost none at all.  Winter highs in the valleys are typically around 35-40 degrees (Fahrenheit) and lows in the single digits, although there are isolated cold pockets from cold air coming off the mountains.  December is often the coldest month and can see sub-zero temperatures at night.  Snow in the valleys usually melts completely around April, and spring characterized by high winds.  This combination can create nasty forest-fire hazard in May and June, particularly following a dry winter.  Winds die down somewhat by June, which is warm (highs in the 70s-80s) and dry.  Monsoon conditions develop in July and persist until around the beginning of September, leading to cooler temperatures (highs in the 70s, lows around 50) and spectacular afternoon thunderstorms that urge the hiker to be off the trails by early afternoon.  This is a great time to visit, but make sure you bring raingear and start your day early.  The thunderstorms usually die out by Labor Day or so, leading to autumn conditions that are temperate, dry (apart from the occasional frontal storm system) and generally very pleasant.  The first snowfall is commonly in October, but snow doesnt start to stick until Thanksgiving or so.  Conditions on the mountains are similar but 10 degrees cooler, with more rain and snow.</field>

Lake Champlain, the nations sixth-largest freshwater body lies at the northwest border with  New York State  and  Canada .  The state is split east-west by the  Green Mountains , which are popular for recreational activities.  The eastern border with  New Hampshire  is defined by the Connecticut River.  Vermont is the only landlocked state in New England which leads to its often being short-changed in guides to the region.  Its highest point is Mount Mansfield at 4,393 ft, and its lowest point is Lake Champlain, at 95 feet.    The state is extremely rural, its valleys littered with farms.  Its largest city is Burlington, pop. 42,417.  Among the states major exports are cheese, maple syrup, marble, slate, and granite.  Tourism is also a very large industry in Vermont, as skiers travel from Boston, New York, Canada, and elsewhere to ski resorts up and down the  Green Mountain  spine during the winter.  In summer, the many bed and breakfasts fill up with couples and families wanting to visit the states small towns and wild areas.  Vermonts autumn foliage is known for being the most spectacular in the country, and possibly the world.  It occurs quite early -- usually mid-September to mid-October.  The only time that the visitor might try to plan around is "Mud Season" (March-April), when unpaved ground becomes undriveable during the thaw.  Even Mud Season has its charms, though.</field>

		<field name="content">Vermont was the 14th state admitted to the United States.  It was not among the original 13 colonies because of a border dispute between New Hampshire and New York which was originally resolved in New Yorks favor.  Vermont residents, led by Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys, fought New Yorks land claims tooth and nail until declaring independence and soon thereafter being admitted to the union. Vermont attracted settlers during the early nineteenth century, but population remained stagnant as flatter land to the West grew in favor. Significantly deforested by upland sheep farming during the 1800s, the forest has regrown (now covering 80% of the state) since dairy became the predominant form of agriculture. Vermonts urban areas have always been minuscule compared to the Northeast; the rural state, once seen as the most conservative in the nation, is now considered politically independent, progressive and protective of its environment and rural character.</field>

The mountains have subsequently been eroded by ice, water, and wind, such that they are rather humble in their current state (they are suspected of having reached the heights of the  Himalayas ).  Today Vermont is home to many wild habitats and their constituent flora and fauna, including northern deciduous forests, coniferous forests, wetlands, farmlands, powerline greenways, and patches of tundra (most notably on Mount Mansfield).  Notable fauna include the black bear, moose, and the pileated woodpecker.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Waldo Lake was effectively isolated from human activity until the late 1800s, when it appeared on a map prepared by the Surveyor-General of Oregon dated August 24, 1863 (Larson 1995). The U.S. Forest Service granted permission to A.R. Black for the construction of a canal on the lake’s natural outlet in 1905; Black later sold the rights to the project to F.N. Ray and Simon Klovdahl in 1908. Ray and Klovdahl intended to monopolize water rights to the entire Willamette Valley using their newly formed Waldo Lake Irrigation and Power Company. Projecting to supply enough water to irrigate 100,000 acres of farmland and to generate 40,000 “horsepowers” of energy, Ray and Klovdahl would’ve had a significant effect impact on the economic, social, and ecological status of the Willamette Valley had they succeeded. Financial and logistic difficulties led to the demise of the project in 1914, but not before the Klovdahl Tunnel was constructed on the lake’s southwestern edge. The tunnel has since been deemed a Natural Historic Place, and stands as a reminder of the first entrepreneurs set on manipulating the lake’s natural processes (Claeyssens 21).  The Forest Service took jurisdiction over the Waldo Lake area in 1934; investigations of the lake’s limnological properties began shortly thereafter. Fishstocking practices had occurred somewhat sporadically since 1889, and continued with increasing regularity and intensity until 1990. (Further discussion of fish management issues will follow). Access to the lake improved drastically in 1966, when roads and lakeside camping facilities were established and expanded. A 13-mile-long paved road between Highway 58 and Waldo opened in 1969; since then, the number of visitors to the area has increased from a few hundred in 1967 to 170,000 in 1994 (Willamette National Forest 2004).

		<field name="content">Waldo Lake  Waldo stretches 9.6 kilometers in length and 2.65 kilometers in width, giving it a total surface area of roughly 26 sq. km and making it the second largest lake in the Oregon Cascades. Its maximum depth (128 m), located at its southern basin, is considerably greater than its mean depth (39 m). Its elevation (1,650 meters above median sea level) and water clarity (Secchi-disk reading 40.5m) classify Waldo Lake as an ultraoligotrophic high-mountain lake (Bronmark 175, Larson 2000: 6). The lake and its watershed are within the Waldo Lake Wilderness Area, and included in the Oregon Scenic Waterway system (qtd. in Larson 2000: 4).  Acclaimed for its intense blue color and transparency, Waldo Lake is a marvel to limnologists, biologists, geologists, and the public alike. Its water is incomparably dilute, chemically similar to distilled tap water (Todd). The combined effects of having a small watershed area (barely twice that of the lake’s total area), organically poor soils, and a heavily forested boundary result in a very low amount of nutrient flow into the lake. As a consequence of having low nutrient levels, phosphorous in particular, appositely low rates of phytoplankton production typify Waldo Lake (Bronmark 177). This feature has changed in the last sixty years, as human access and use of the lake has increased.</field>

Mountain hemlock, true fir, and lodgepole pine dominate the immediate area surrounding the lake. Soils are organically poor, highly permeable, and less than 2 meters deep: basalt bedrock is visible at many places around the lake (Larson 2000: 5, personal observation 2003).  The ODFW stocked Waldo with rainbow trout, brook trout, kokanee salmon, and cutthroat trout until 1990. Opossum shrimp (mysids) were also released as an additional food source for fish between 1965 and 1967 (Ziller 146, Larson 2000: 9).</field>

		<field name="content">Wallowa Lake has an enriched history dating back to the days when Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce inhabited the land.  After the gold rush occurred (ultimately populating the wallowas), the government took back most of its land from the tribe. Angered by this action, some of the Nez Perce retaliated by slaying some whites nearby. This turned into a long battle between the two forces.  Chief Joseph and his followers eventually surrendered, but were never able to return to the Wallowa Valley.  A tribute to Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce is present all throughout Wallowa Lake and its surroundings. It is still marked as one of the most influential struggles between native tribes and the injustice of the United States government.</field>

The mountain located next to the lake is great place for sight seeing and be able to feed the chipmunks.  The lake is also surrounded by many pines.  One pine in particular was found in the surrounding Wallowa Mountains. Pinus contorta, Chief Joseph, is a dwarf pine that is very rare and is known for its drastic change from green in the summer to bright gold in the winter time.</field>

		<field name="content">Disneyland  was an unmitigated success.  Walt Disney had created not just an amusement park, where children could ride kiddie rides while their parents watched from a bench, but the worlds first true theme park, a place where children and grown-ups could both have fun, together.  But it was not long after Disneylands 1955 opening that Walt realized that the available space in  Anaheim  was too small.  He had his park, but he and his Imagineers were constantly coming up with new ideas, ideas that just werent going to fit inside Disneyland.  In the sixties, Walt began looking to the east coast, for a place with enough space to hold all of the ideas his team could dream up.  He found such a place in  Central Florida , southwest of the sleepy city of  Orlando .  Here, along the new Interstate 4, there was plenty of space, far more than would be needed for just a single theme park.  Walt had grander ideas in mind for this "Florida Project" of his.  After buying up over 27,000 acres (11,000nbsp;ha) of land on the sly, Walt announced his ambitious Disney World plans to the world.  A theme park would be built, of coursemdash;a Magic Kingdom on the north end of the property.  But to get there from I-4, guests would need to pass through the true centerpiece of the project: EPCOT, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.  EPCOT was Walt Disneys largest, most revolutionary idea yetmdash;a real city, with 20,000 real people living and working within, making use of the most advanced technologies to grow food, provide transport, and enhance quality of life.  Much of the technology was already in use at Disneylandmdash;PeopleMovers and monorails, for instancemdash;but these would not be amusement rides.  EPCOT was to be a place where the Imagineers ideas were put to practical use, for the betterment of all mankind.  Alas, it was not to be.  Walt died in December 1966, just as the Florida Project was coming to fruition.  Without Walt to drive the project, the company board refused to undertake the ambitious EPCOT plans.  But Walts brother Roy O. Disney insisted the project as a whole go forward, starting with the Magic Kingdom.  Roy changed the projects name to  Walt Disney World; this new resort would be a tribute to Walts vision, but would never really be the fulfillment of it.  The  Magic Kingdom  opened on October 1, 1971, with two hotels, a campground, and two  golf courses  nearby.  It was an immediate success, single-handedly sparking the development of the Orlando area as one of the countrys busiest vacation destinations.  Though Roy died before the year ended, he had succeeded in getting his brothers final project off the ground.  Walt Disney Worlds first decade passed quickly, and by the time of its "Tencennial" celebration in 1981, a new theme park was being built in the space Walt had envisioned for EPCOT.  The new park would be called  EPCOT Center , though it bore little resemblance to Walts original plans.  Instead, EPCOT Center would be a sort of "permanent worlds fair", combining Future World, made up of grand pavilions devoted to human progress, with a World Showcase of meticulously detailed recreations of foreign lands.  EPCOT Center opened in 1982, and was followed by a combination theme park and movie studio called  Disney-MGM Studios  in 1989, and then by  Disneys Animal Kingdom , a zoological theme park, in 1998.  Over the years, numerous resort hotels and recreational activities were added to support the increased attendance at the multi-park resort.  Two large water parks were added in 1989 and in 1995.  In addition, a remote area of the property that started as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village evolved into the Disney Village Marketplace, and eventually expanded to become  Downtown Disney , an adult-oriented shopping and entertainment district.  Walt Disney never would have imagined what Walt Disney World has become, and it is far removed from his original vision.  But one of his guiding principles was to "keep moving forward", and Disney World has done just that, becoming the largest and most popular theme park resort complex in the world.</field>

One very informative set of books are the Imagineering Field Guides; theres one for each of the four parks (plus one for  Disneyland ).  They go through each park area-by-area and feature great concept images (some rarely seen), behind-the-scenes details, and tricks of the Imagineering trade.  Theyre also small enough to carry in your pocket as you tour the parks.  Surprisingly, not much fiction has been written about the parks themselves.  Ridley Pearson has an ongoing series of young-adult novels set inside the parks, called The Kingdom Keepers. Carole Marsh has written The Mystery at Walt Disney World as part of her Real Kids, Real Places mystery series. Theres also Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, a science-fiction novel by Cory Doctorow that takes place primarily in a future version of the Magic Kingdom.</field>

		<field name="content">The Walt Disney Company is a multinational media conglomerate, so video productions featuring Walt Disney World are ubiquitous.  Several television programs have filmed on-location at the resort.  The 1990s-era revival of The Mickey Mouse Club (the one that gave Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake their starts) was filmed entirely at the production facilities inside Disney-MGM Studios (now Hollywood Studios).  Full House, Roseanne, Family Matters, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch  are among the sitcoms (mostly on Disney-owned ABC) with episodes showing the characters visiting Walt Disney World.  Another fun option, if you can find it, is 1990s The Muppets at Walt Disney World, which was intended as a precursor to Disneys purchase of the Muppets (which finally happened in 2004).  Those shows only used the park as a backdrop, though, so they have limited "tourist" value.  For meatier fare, theres always the yearly Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade, which often includes segments showing the latest and greatest attractions around the World.  If youre going to watch the parade just to get planning information, though, you might as well just call Disney at +1 407 W-DISNEY and ask for their  free vacation planning video . As expected, you wont find much official material that addresses the problems you might encounter at Walt Disney World, but they do offer a good introduction to the resort for first-timers who are trying to get a feel for the place before they go. Another good source of information is the  official YouTube channel  of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.  Disney has also made a few full-length features based on various rides in the parksmdash;the four Pirates of the Caribbean films being by far the bestmdash;but dont expect the rides to have much of anything to do with the films.  Okay, yes, Jack Sparrow can now be spotted inside the Pirates ride, but its just a cameo appearance.  Last but not least, Walt Disney World is featured in three "Disney Sing Along Songs" titles. Campout at Walt Disney World is set at Fort Wilderness Campground, Beach Party at Walt Disney World covers a wide range of activities including the two water parks, and Fliks Musical Adventure is set at Disneys Animal Kingdom.</field>

		<field name="content">Like all of  Central Florida , the climate at Walt Disney World is humid and subtropical.  Summer (Mayndash;October) is hot and sticky, while winter (Novemberndash;April) is mild and drier.  Visitors from higher latitudes are often surprised by the sheer intensity of the summer sun in Florida, which can rise to within a few degrees of straight overhead in June and July.  In June through September, late afternoon thundershowers are very common; plan accordingly.  That said, climate problems are well known at Walt Disney World and there are several means to cope (see  "Weather"  in the Stay Safe section).  Inclement weather can often lead to the temporary closure of outdoor rides and live performances. In the case of rides, they will re-open after the weather improves, and FastPass tickets will continue to be accepted, even if the printed time interval has expired. Live performances may be either delayed or canceled outright. On the other hand, inclement weather could work to your advantage, as it drives some visitors away from outdoor areas, or out of the parks entirely.</field>

Both Friday and Saturday are transition days for park visitors, especially in the summer months. Saturdays do draw in more Annual Pass holders to the park, but that is the major day that people either arrive or leave the area. This causes attendance figures to be down, making it a perfect day to visit the parks.   If you are planning to have a day of rest in your vacation, by arriving on Thursday you can enjoy two days of parks with reduced crowds and then use Sunday to rest. If during those first two days you are planning to visit the Magic Kingdom, plan to do it on Friday. Attendance figures pick up for that park on Saturday. You will be able to do more attractions in the first two days while you are revved up, and then it will allow you to relax and enjoy the park on the more crowded days.</field>

		<field name="content">There used to be some times of year when the parks were relatively deserted, but not so much anymore.  Now they just vary from "moderately busy" to "completely insane".  Still, deciding when to go remains a game of trade-offs: you must decide whether to favor lower crowds or longer park hours, and decide whether you prefer scorching days or chilly nights.  The peak periods for attendance are late December, mid-June to mid-August, and mid-February to mid-April.  Why?  Thats when kids are on break from school.  If you have kids, you may have no choice but to go during these peak times.  The bad news is that youll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of your new closest friends, youll wait two hours to go on rides like Splash Mountain and Soarin, and youll be paying a premium for the privilege.  In the summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat.  On the bright side, though, youll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to be open late, and as many rides as possible will be up and running.  If your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak periods.  Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December (pre-Christmas), and January.  These can be very good times to go; crowds are low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours.  In the winter, its often too cold to go to the water parks, and youll need a jacket at night.  The weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the kids out of school if youre bringing them along.  Of course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a special event.  (Its no coincidence that these events are scheduled during otherwise-slow periods for the parks.)   Epcot  has two months-long events: the Epcot International Flower Garden Festival runs from March to mid-May, and the Epcot International Food Wine Festival runs from October through mid-November.   Hollywood Studios  is the location for Star Wars Weekends in May and June.  The  Magic Kingdom  hosts two special hard-ticket holiday events, Mickeys Not-So-Scary Halloween Party in September and October, and Mickeys Very Merry Christmas Party in November and December.  These events, which let you stay in the park past the normal closing time, cost more than $50 per person, but tickets are limited so the crowds remain manageable.   How do they get the star on top?   Speaking of Christmas, the month of December may just be the most magical time of year at Walt Disney World.  The entire resort goes all-out to decorate everything, with huge themed Christmas trees in each of the parks and each of the resorts, and the spectacular Castle Dreamlights draped onto Cinderella Castle.  There are also countless holiday events at the resorts, the Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights at Hollywood Studios, the Candlelight Processional at Epcot, and much much more.  And as long as you avoid Thanksgiving week and Christmas week, the crowds really arent that bad.</field>

		<field name="title">Walt Disney World/Downtown Disney</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">In 1975, just a few years after Walt Disney World opened, Disney created a small shopping district far to the southeast of the  Magic Kingdom , which was at the time the only developed area of the property.  As the Walt Disney World Village, and later the Disney Village Marketplace, it remained a remote and rarely visited destination for many years.  The only real attraction aside from shopping was the Empress Lilly (now Fultons Crab House), a non-functional replica paddlewheel boat named after Walts widow that featured three separate dining rooms.    In the late eighties, however, as Walt Disney World prepared to open its third theme park, executives realized that adult guests would want to have a place to go after the parks closed, where they could have a drink or go out dancing.  And why, they reasoned, should Disney force such guests to go off-property to the city of  Orlando  to find nightlife, when they could keep them (and their money) on-property?  The result was Pleasure Island, a themed collection of nightclubs (with a few restaurants and shops scattered among them) built right next door to the Marketplace.  Even though Pleasure Island charged admission (although it was included in many vacation packages), it was a huge success, keeping Disney visitors on Disney property, and even attracting locals interested in unique nightclubs like the Adventurers Club and restaurants like Planet Hollywood.  The concept was expanded even further in 1997 with the renaming of the entire area to Downtown Disney, and the opening of the Downtown Disney West Side.  The West Side, on the far side of Pleasure Island from the Marketplace, was anchored by the giant circus arena created for a Cirque du Soleil show, and the five-story indoor play area DisneyQuest.  It also included several high-concept restaurants such as Bongos Cuban Cafe and House of Blues.  In 2008, Disney closed down the six remaining Pleasure Island nightclubs, leaving it relatively barren, although the restaurants and shops remain open.  Disney then announced plans to convert Pleasure Island into a new district called Hyperion Wharf, but that plan appears to have been shelved in favor of a new idea.  In March 2013, Disney released a plan to re-imagine the entire Downtown Disney area as Disney Springs, representing a town that grew around a natural spring in central Florida.  The West Side and Marketplace will remain, while Pleasure Island becomes "The Landing", and a new "Town Center" is built to serve as the main entrance of the complex.  To make up for the loss of parking caused by the construction, Disney will add two parking garages.  Even with the areas transformation in its earliest stages, though, Downtown Disney as a whole remains an active and vibrant district, with a variety of non-theme-park entertainment for Walt Disney World guests and off-property visitors alike.</field>

		<field name="content">The name EPCOT was originally an acronym for Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow, Walt Disneys last and most ambitious project.  His grand vision for EPCOT was as the real centerpiece of Disney Worldmdash;a living, working city of the future, with 20,000 residents using the most modern innovations in urban planning, transportation, and technology.  The rest of Disney World, even the Magic Kingdom, would exist only to draw people in to see EPCOT and the promise it held for the future.  Walt died in 1966, and though the renamed Walt Disney World and its Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, EPCOT was off the table.  The vision was just too grand, too ambitious, for anyone but Walt himself to see through to completion.  With Walt Disney World an unmitigated success, though, the company soon began developing concepts for a second theme park, and naturally turned to Walts original vision for inspiration.  When two competing proposalsmdash;one for a set of pavilions highlighting the history and future of human progress, and the other for an international plaza that showcased cultures and cooperationmdash;became the leading candidates, someone pushed the two scale models together to create a combined park.  EPCOT Center was born.  That name, with which the park opened in 1982, was intended to show that the new park exhibited the ideals that were to be at the core, or center, of Walts EPCOT.  The park was renamed in 1994 to Epcot 94, then to Epcot 95 a year later.  The yearly numbering scheme reflected the "worlds fair" theme, but it inhibited consistent branding, so in 1996 the park became just "Epcot".  While the original EPCOT concept might now seem a bit far-fetched, todays Epcot is dedicated to creating the brighter tomorrow that Walt Disney envisioned.</field>

		<field name="content">The genesis of the "Studios" theme park was as a new pavilion for  EPCOT Centers  Future World that would provide an animatronic ride through cinematic history, much as World of Motion did for transportation and Spaceship Earth did for communication.  This spark of an idea was so inspiring, however, that then-CEO Michael Eisner suggested that the new ride instead become the marquee attraction in an all-new theme park.  The original vision for this new park was to combine a traditional theme park atmospheremdash;rides, shows, restaurantsmdash;with a real working production studio.  A team of animators began work even before the park opened to the public, working on real Disney animationmdash;Mulan and Lilo Stitch, among others, were animated entirely at the theme park.  Live-action was also filmed here, from movies like Newsies and Ernest Saves Christmas to television shows such as Mickey Mouse Club and Adventures in Wonderland.  Most importantly, all of these production facilities were viewable on the parks Backstage Studio Tourmdash;guests could actually see animating and filming as they occurred, if their timing was right; if not, they still got to see the real sets and real studios where their favorite productions were created.  A backlot was also created and placed on the tour, with house façades used in actual films and television shows and authentic props from movies like Flight of the Navigator and Star Wars.  Those days are gone; the parks sound stages have been converted to rides and stage shows, and the animation facility has closed down.  The original ride idea, the one planned for Epcot, survives as the parks centerpiece, The Great Movie Ride, and a small backlot area still exists as part of a truncated backstage tour.  New thrill rides have opened up and become the parks main draws, but the park retains its enthusiasm for the fantasy worlds created on film, and guests can still enjoy being able to "step into" their favorite productions.   The Osborne Family Spectacle of Lights, or some small fraction thereof.</field>

		<field name="content">Walt Disney was never one to rest on his laurels.   Disneyland  was a huge success, but the amount of space available there in California was too restrictive.  Disney had bigger ideas, far bigger than would ever fit at Disneyland.  The solution was to buy up thousands of acres in  Central Florida , southwest of Orlando, for a new "Disney World", big enough to hold all the ideas he and his Imagineers could dream up.  The centerpiece was to be  EPCOT , Walts idea for an experimental "community of tomorrow" where real people would live, work, and play.  Although a Disneyland-style park was part of the planningmdash;a necessary concession to economic realitiesmdash;Walt had very little interest in recreating what hed done before, and his energies were focused on EPCOT.  Unfortunately, he passed away in 1966, not long after revealing his plans to the world.  His dream of EPCOT died with him, but his brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, was determined to go forward with the Florida project.  The project would start with the Magic Kingdom.  Roy Disney worked tirelessly to ensure that the park would open, to preserve at least a part of his brothers last and greatest dream.  On October 1, 1971, the Magic Kingdom did indeed open, with many similarities to Disneyland but many differences as well.  It was a roaring success and, though Roy Disney died just two months later, Walt Disney World was successfully launched, and it has thrived ever since, with the Magic Kingdom as its anchor.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">The skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains ever found in North America, were discovered in Washington. Prior to the arrival of explorers from Europe, the region had many established tribes of Native Americans, notable for their well developed economy, complex trade agreements, elaborate and generous culture and ornate art forms and carving. Prominent among their industries along the coast were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting.   The first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775. He claimed all the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound for Spain, which they maintained made the Pacific a "Spanish lake" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.  Early European explores unwittingly introduced smallpox which decimated the native culture.  In 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers in 1790 and 1791, and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792.  The British Camp in the San Juan Island National Historical Park is the only part of a US national park that commemorates a British military site and the only one that flies the British Union Flag.  The British-Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the Columbia. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in sea otter pelts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the state on October 10, 1805.  Britain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as "joint occupancy" of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, were deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.  Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country, Hudsons Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District.  The growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory, which was granted by the U.S. government in 1853. The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present states, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state. The creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889.</field>

The part of the state east of the Cascades is quite dry and arid. In the Puget Sound area, it rains often but the volume is not as much as many other major cities. Being in a convergence zone the weather can change very quickly and is often times difficult to predict. The west coast of the Olympic peninsula is the rainiest part of the state and sustains lush rain forests.</field>

		<field name="content">Located at the southwestern point of Washington County, Watch Hill is a village in the town of Westerly. Situated on a peninsula that stretches out into Block Island sound, Watch Hill forms with Napatree Point to create ‘little Narragansett Bay’. This small bay offers excellent protection from strong currents, and provides a harbor where many sailboats and yachts moor and dock. On clear days, both Fishers Island and Long Island NY, can be seen to the South of Napatree Point. Watch Hill was occupied in the seventeenth century by the Nianticks, a part of the Narragansett Native American tribe. The area we now call Watch Hill was used as a watch point in the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War by Europeans.  This is how Watch Hill got its name! In fact, Napatree Point was once used as a military installation by the U.S. Military, and an abandoned cement fort can be found at the end of Napatree. In 1882 the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations purchased Watch Hill from the remaining Nianticks for $5,000. In 1901, Watch Hill was authorized as a fire-district, therefore, residents of Watch Hill fund their own volunteer department. However, non-fire related taxes are paid to the town of Westerly, because Watch Hill is a Westerly village.  Primarily, a summer vacation area, due to the pristine beaches, Watch Hill is known for its mansions. At one time, the most expensive residential home was located off of Yosemite Valley Road in Watch Hill. Aside from the breathtaking scenery, Watch Hill was once a hideout for Albert Einstein and Isadora Duncan.</field>

Among the 60 original men, women, and children, were 15 Puritan families who had traveled in the ship Confidence from England. Bringing with them the English pattern of farming, with collective fields and grazing along with individual lots, they named their town Sudbury after the town in Suffolk, where their pastor Edmund Brown and some of their company had lived. The original settlement was clustered one half mile northwest of where the town center is now located. Wayland and Sudbury residents established the Sudbury Valley Trust in 1953 in part to protect these lands. Today Wayland is in the top 5 communities in the state in conservation acreage.</field>

The Pequod Inn stood at the intersection of the Post Road and the roads north to western Sudbury and Concord. Baldwin ’s tavern was near the four arch bridge over the river. The First Parish Church was built in 1815, complete with a bell by Paul Revere.  In 1835, the men attending a town meeting voted to change the name East Sudbury to Wayland, to honor Rev. Francis Wayland, President of Brown University, who was a friend of Judge Edward Mellen (whose law offices are found in the Wayland Historic District in a small white house at the intersection of Boston Post Road and Old Sudbury Road).</field>

		<field name="content">In the mid-17th century, John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the Indians, established "praying towns" where Native Americans took up Christianity and were expected to renounce their religious ceremonies, traditional dress, and customs. One Praying town, called Wabaquasset (Senexet, Wabiquisset), 6 miles west of the Quinebaug River in present-day Woodstock, was the largest of the three northeastern Connecticut praying towns.  In 1675, when King Philips War broke out, some of the towns Indians, (especially in the southern part of the town) sided with the Mohegans and the English while others sided with the Indians led by Philip, rallying to arms on what is now Curtis Island in present Holland, Massachusetts and Brimfield, Massachusetts. During the war, the Praying town became deserted, and the English with their Indian allies marched through Woodstock to present day Thompson in the summer of 1676 burning any crops or stored corn they could find.  In 1682, Massachusetts bought a tract of land, which included Woodstock, from the Mohegans. A group of 13 men from Roxbury, Mass. (home of the Pastorate of Woodstocks earlier visitor, John Eliot), settled the town in 1686 and named it New Roxbury. Judge Samuel Sewall suggested the town change its name to Woodstock in 1690, and in 1749 the town became part of Connecticut.  A farming town in the 18th century, Woodstock began attracting industry after the War of 1812. "By 1820, there were 2 distilleries, 2 wheel wrights, an oil mill, fulling mill, carding machines, grist mills, saw mills, a goldsmith, and twine and cotton batting operations. Woodstock Valley was known for its shoe factories," according to the history page at the Woodstock town government Web site.  By the middle of the 19th century, industry almost ceased, and Woodstock reverted back to a rural state. The town then became a summer destination for wealthy city dwellers from around the East coast of the United States.</field>

		<field name="content">Long before any recorded human history in Yellowstone, a massive volcanic eruption spewed an immense volume of ash that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern Mexico and some areas of the eastern Pacific Coast. The eruption may have been as much as one thousand times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of  Mt. St. Helens , and it left a caldera approximately 34 by 45 miles (55 by 72 km). The Yellowstone super volcano is believed to erupt every 600,000 to 900,000 years with the last event occurring 640,000 years ago. Its eruptions are among the largest known to have ever occurred on Earth, producing drastic climate change in the aftermath. Although it is commonly assumed that the park was named for the yellow rocks seen in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the parks name comes from the Yellowstone River that flows through it, which is in turn named after sandstone bluffs found farther down its course in eastern Montana.  On March 1,1872, Yellowstone became the first National Park reserve declared anywhere in the world, by President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1978 it was designated a  World Heritage Site  by UNESCO.</field>

		<field name="content">With half of the earths geothermal features, Yellowstone holds the planets most diverse and intact collection of geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles. Its more than 300 geysers make up two thirds of all those found on earth. Combine this with more than 10,000 thermal features comprised of brilliantly colored hot springs, bubbling mudpots, and steaming fumaroles, and you have a place like no other.  Yellowstones hydrothermal features would not exist without the underlying magma body that releases tremendous heat. They also depend on sources of water, such as from the mountains surrounding the Yellowstone Plateau. There, snow and rain slowly percolate through layers of permeable rock riddled with cracks. Some of this cold water meets hot brine directly heated by the shallow magma body. The waters temperature rises well above the boiling point but the water remains in a liquid state due to the great pressure and weight of the overlying water. The result is superheated water with temperatures exceeding 400 ° F.  The superheated water is less dense than the colder, heavier water sinking around it. This creates convection currents that allow the lighter, more buoyant, superheated water to begin its journey back to the surface following the cracks and weak areas through rhyolitic lava flows. This upward path is the natural "plumbing" system of the parks hydrothermal features.  Once it reaches the surface, the various colors of the pools are due to different types of bacteria growing in different temperatures.</field>

		<field name="content">It is not at all unusual to see many types of bears, like this black bear, near the roadways or up on the ridges of Yellowstone in the summertime, usually foraging for food.   The park is the core of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the largest intact temperate zone ecosystems remaining on the planet, and as a result is an exceptional area for wildlife viewing.  Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states. Sixty-seven different mammals live here, including grizzly bears and black bears. Gray wolves were restored in 1995 and more than 100 live in the park now. Wolverine and lynx, which require large expanses of undisturbed habitat, are also found in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Seven native ungulate species - elk, mule deer, bison, moose, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and white-tailed deer live here. Non-native mountain goats have colonized northern portions of the park and numerous small mammals are found throughout the park.  Records of bird sightings have been kept in Yellowstone since its establishment in 1872; these records document 330 species of birds to date, of which approximately 148 species are known to nest in the park. The variation in elevation and broad array of habitat types found within the park contributes to the regions relatively high diversity.  Glacial activity and current cool and dry conditions are likely responsible for the relatively small number of reptiles and amphibians found in the park.  Yellowstone is home to more than 1,350 species of vascular plants, of which 218 are non-native.</field>

		<field name="content">The weather in Yellowstone National Park can change very rapidly from sunny and warm to cold and rainy, so its important to bring along extra layers of clothing which can be used as needed.  Snow can fall in Yellowstone at any time of the year.   Summer: Daytime temperatures are often in the 70s (25°C) and occasionally in the 80s (30°C) in lower elevations. Nights are usually cool and temperatures may drop below freezing at higher elevations. Thunderstorms are common in the afternoons.   Winter: Temperatures often range from zero to 20°F(-20°C to -5°C) throughout the day. Sub-zero temperatures over-night are common. The record low temperature is -66F (-54°C). Snowfall is highly variable. While the average is 150 inches per year, it is not uncommon for higher elevations to get twice that amount.   Spring Fall: Daytime temperatures range from the 30s to the 60s (0 to 20°C) with overnight lows in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20°C). Snow is common in the Spring and Fall with regular accumulations of 12" in a 24 hour period. At any time of year, be prepared for sudden changes. Unpredictability, more than anything else, characterizes Yellowstone’s weather. Always be equipped with a wide range of clothing options. Be sure to bring a warm jacket and rain gear even in the summer.</field>

		<field name="content">Efforts to protect Yosemite Valley began as far back as June 30, 1864 when President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill granting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias to the State of California as an inalienable public trust. This was the first time in history that a federal government had set aside scenic lands simply to protect them and to allow for their enjoyment by all people. The area became a national park on October 1, 1890 following several years of struggle by John Muir against the devastation of the subalpine meadows surrounding Yosemite Valley.  Despite its national park status, California controlled the initial grant area until 1906.  Prior to ceding control, the city of San Francisco became embroiled in a bitter political struggle over the Hetch Hetchy Valley, in which the city wanted to dam the Tuolumne River as a source of drinking water and hydroelectric power. In 1913, conservationists led by John Muir lost the battle when Congress passed the Raker Act, authorizing the construction of OShaughnessy Dam.  To this day crusades to restore Hetch Hetchy are ongoing.  Yosemite has grown from a little visited, yet historically significant, park to one of the "crown jewels" of the US National Park System.  With this stature comes difficulties; current visitation numbers roughly 4 million visitors per year, with a majority visiting 12 square miles within Yosemite Valley (about 1% of the total park land).  The dual role of the park service -- protection of the resource and provide for the enjoyment of the visitor -- makes sure that Yosemite continues to be an important breeding ground for management ideas about US National Parks.</field>

		<field name="content">Yosemite is best known for the massive granite cliffs and domes found within the park.  The landscape began forming about ten million years ago when the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes.  The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached 4,000 feet during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.  The park is also home to the Yosemite Falls, at 739m (2425ft), the highest  waterfall  in  North America .</field>

		<field name="content">Yosemite has more than 300 species of vertebrate animals, and 85 of these are native mammals. Black bears are abundant in the park, and are often involved in conflicts with humans that result in property damage and, occasionally, injuries to humans. Visitor education and bear management efforts have reduced the bear-human incidents and property damage by 90% in the past few years. Ungulates include large numbers of mule deer. Bighorn sheep formerly populated the Sierra crest, but have been reduced to only a few remnant populations. There are 17 species of bats, 9 of which are either Federal or California Species of Special Concern. Over 150 species of birds regularly occur in the parks. Other species that are found within the park include bobcat, gray fox, mountain beaver, great gray owls, white-headed woodpeckers, spotted owls, golden-mantled ground squirrel, martens, Stellers jays, pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed hare, and coyotes.  The vegetation in the park is primarily coniferous forest.  Most notable among the parks trees are isolated groves of giant sequoias, the largest trees in the world, which are found in three groves in Yosemite National Park.</field>

When visiting it is wise to pack for any season with clothing that can be layered, ready to peel off or add on as conditions dictate.  Always include some kind of rain gear; the park receives most of its precipitation in the months of January, February and March, but storms are common during the transitional spring and fall seasons, and spectacular thunderstorms may occur during summer.  For Yosemite Valley and Wawona (subtract 10-20°F (5-10°C) for Tuolumne Meadows), average weather is as follows:   Summer: Typically dry, with occasional thunderstorms; temperatures from 50°F (10°C) to the low 90°F (30°C) range.  Fall Spring: Highly variable, with typical high temperatures ranging from 50-80°F (10-27°C), with lows from 30-40°F (-1 to 4°C). Rain is less likely early in fall/late in spring and rain or snow is likely late in fall/early in spring.  Winter: Snowy, rainy, or (sometimes) even sunny days are possible, with highs ranging from 30-60°F (-1 to 16°C) and lows in the high 20°F (-4 to 0°C) range.  Winter Storm Warnings indicate a significant storm is impending or occurring.</field>

The Yosemite Valley Railroad was built to remove the lumber harvested from the vast supply of Sugar Pines found along the Merced River canyon.  Author Hank Johnston’s book, “Whistles Blow No More”  , describes the activities of the Yosemite Lumber Company in this area.  In fact, the remains of the longest Incline rail system ever built are located at what is known as Camp One, just a short distance away from the Yosemite West development.  The incline rose to a height of 3,100 feet (950 m) above the Merced River.  The Camp One incline was used to lower logs to the Merced River at  El Portal  from the logging area.  One of the stops on the Yosemite Valley Railroad line was the lumber mill built by the Yosemite Lumber Company where the wood was planed, finished, dried and stored. The lumber company is gone now and as a result of natural reforestation, trees surround most homes. The old train grades were redeveloped creating paved roads and underground utilities which give Yosemite West a pleasant rural atmosphere unfettered by power lines.

		<field name="content">Ypsilanti has a fairly typical Midwestern climate, with four distinct seasons.  Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures occasionally reaching above 90 degrees but averaging in the low- to mid-80s. The hottest months are June through early September. Summer often brings severe thunderstorms and even tornadoes to the area. Tornado sirens are sounded when a warning is issued, and they can be heard throughout the city; however, surrounding areas often lack such warning devices.  September, October, April, and May tend to bring mild temperatures, although snow may come as early as October or as late as April.  Winter lows average in the teens, but temperatures do periodically plunge into the single digits, and even below zero from time to time. If visiting in the winter, be prepared to dress for cold weather and snow. Although a local ordinance mandates that residents and business owners must clear snow from their sidewalks in a timely manner, this is not always enforced, particularly in residential areas, so if youll be walking, be prepared to trudge through snow; boots are a must.</field>

		<field name="content">Like many cities, Ypsilanti once had a large psychiatric hospital, now closed. Ypsilanti State Hospital was the setting for a classic work of psychology,  The Three Christs of Ypsilanti , by psychologist Milton Rokeach (1964). The book describes his experimental case study with three men from the hospital. In a study which would not be permitted today for ethical reasons, Rokeach brought together three patients with schizophrenia, each of whom held the delusion that he was the one and only Jesus Christ, in an age before widespread availability of antipsychotic drugs. Rokeach was interested in what would happen to their delusions by coming across others who also believed they were Christ, to test how rigid delusions really are. Rokeach met with them daily as a group, giving them various assignments and experiments, and even moving them in together. However, despite all efforts he was not able to change the fundamental nature of their delusions, demonstrating how rigid and resistant to change delusions are and how people who experience them are able to find all kinds of rationales for their delusions, and alter these rationales to fit new and disconfirming experiences. The work also illustrates other classic symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with language. Despite this, the experience did lead to some small changes in their beliefs and ways of relating to each other. The work doesnt require the reader to have any knowledge of psychology and is still in print. It gives an insight into the experience of living with schizophrenia, psychosis and grandiose delusions, as well as conditions in American inpatient psychiatric hospitals of the 1950s and 1960s (also portrayed in Ken Keseys classic 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest).</field>

		<field name="content">Mormon pioneer Issac Behunin built the first log cabin in Zion Canyon in 1863, near the location of the current Zion Lodge. Behunin Canyon, a technical slot canyon, was named after him.  During the remainder of the century, small communities and homesteads in the area struggled to survive. Pioneers gave the canyon the name "Zion", a Hebrew word meaning safety, or a place of refuge. Despite the name, the canyon offered little arable land, poor soil, and catastrophic flooding, making agriculture a risky venture. By the first decade of the 20th century, the scenic qualities of southern Utah, and Zion Canyon in particular, had been recognized as a potential destination for tourism. In 1909, a presidential executive order designated Mukuntuweap National Monument. The new monument was, however, virtually inaccessible to visitors, since the existing roads were in poor condition and the closest railhead was a hundred miles away. The monuments name was changed to Zion National Monument in 1918, and in 1919 the monument was expanded and designated a national park. Visitation to the new national park increased steadily during the 1920s, and in 1930, the newly completed Zion-Mt Carmel Highway allowed motorists to travel through the park to  Mount Carmel Junction , then on to  Bryce Canyon  and the  Grand Canyon . This highway was one of the greatest engineering feats of modern times, requiring the construction of a 5,613-foot tunnel, the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel, to negotiate the vertical sandstone cliffs of Zion. The switchbacks leading up to the tunnel proved to be an even greater task to accomplish. The Kolob Canyons section, near  Cedar City  was established as a National Monument in 1937 and added to Zion National Park in 1956.</field>

The park is characterized by high plateaus, a maze of narrow, deep, sandstone canyons and striking rock towers and mesas. The North Fork of the Virgin River has carved a spectacular gorge in the park called the Zion Narrows. The canyon walls in some places rise 2000–3000 feet above the canyon floor. The southern part of the park is a lower desert area where colorful mesas border rocky canyons and washes. The northern sections of the park are higher plateaus covered by forests. To the east is amazing slickrock country and a vast array of unpaved trails, hidden canyons and peaks to explore.</field>

Lows in the 30s are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30 at 6am, 55 by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 95 and lows in the mid-70s. During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (the "seabreezes") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like powerful Plains ones), 50+mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95 to 75 and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop from 95 to 75.   In 2004, Frostproof was hit by three hurricanes: Charley, Frances, Jeanne. It was the first time in recorded U.S. history that 3 hurricanes passed through the same county (Polk County) in the same year, with Lake Wales and other southern Polk County towns lying closest to the path of these hurricanes eyes.</field>

Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (each called a "seabreeze") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+nbsp;mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Lake Alfred was established in 1883 soon after the South Florida Railroad reached the area by settlers escaping the cold of Fargo, North Dakota. The town was initially called "Fargo", but the Post Office objected over confusion with  Largo . The town then took on the name Chubb and later Bartow Junction because it lay at the junction of a road leading south into the county seat Bartow. In 1913, it was named Lake Alfred after the nearby lake which, in turn, had been named for Alfred Parslow, an early settler. The Mackay estate on the north shore of Lake Rochelle was built around 1920. It was purchased in 2004 by the city and is slowly being renovated to its original glory and will hopefully be placed on the National Register of Historic Places soon.</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Fort Meade is the oldest city in Polk County, dating its origins to 1849 when it was an old military road from Tampa (Fort Brooke) to Fort Pierce during the Indian wars. The 1880s business district was located on old Wire Street (now Broadway), which was a casualty of 4 devastating fires. Today, there are over 150 which are designated as landmarks. In the 1890s the Fort Meade Street Railway operated a horse-drawn service in the town.  The earliest known burial is John I. Hooker (1821–1862) located in the Evergreen Cemetery in town. Fort Meades Christ Church (Episcopal) located at 526 N. Oak was built in 1889. It is a frame vernacular with Gothic Revival elements and was designed by architect J. H. Weddell. A minister by the name of C.E Butler had committed suicide at the church in 1894. Located next to Christ Church is the famous Rev. Wm James Reid House. Located within the historic district, the house was used for the HBO motion picture The Judgement featuring Blythe Danner, Keith Carradine and Jack Warden (1990).  Future Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was stationed at the fort in 1851. The town was burned by Union forces in 1864 and all of the original structures were destroyed, except the 2nd fort which was dismantled in the 1890s. Fort Meade has over 300 homes on the National Register of Historic Places and a handful that date to the late 1800s.</field>

		<field name="title">Buffalo/Downtown</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Not surprisingly, downtown Buffalo is the oldest section of the city. Though the official incorporation of Buffalo dates to 1804, it is known that there was a tiny trading post, a few cabins, and perhaps a half-dozen settlers located here before that date—and perhaps even before the Holland Land Companys purchase eleven years earlier of all of what is today  New York State  west of the Genesee River. However, it was in 1798 when Joseph Ellicott, a land agent and surveyor for the Holland Land Company, arrived at the junction of the Buffalo River and Lake Erie. Soon afterward, he began to lay out streets and lots for a village he called New Amsterdam, but which the residents insisted on calling Buffalo (a name change that was made official in 1808). Joseph Ellicott was the brother of Andrew Ellicott, who was responsible for surveying the streets of  Washington, D.C. ; the radial streets that Joseph Ellicott laid out in Buffalo, centered on Niagara Square and largely intact today, certainly bear a great deal of similarity to the street plan of Washington and also testify to the greatness that Ellicott envisioned for Buffalo—though it was well beyond the frontier of settlement at that time, Ellicott predicted that Buffalo would someday be a huge city and an important inland port. Ellicotts vision came to fruition in 1825 with the completion of the Erie Canal from the Hudson River at  Albany  to Buffalo Harbor, kickstarting a century of meteoric growth for Buffalo.  It is important to note that for all of Buffalos importance during those early years as an inland port and manufacturing center, commerce played a much smaller role in its economy than industry. Buffalos commercial district at that time was quite small, hugging the north side of the harbor and extending no further north than Church Street. By contrast, the northern reaches of todays downtown, i.e. the Theater District, were residential; even Niagara Square was a cluster of elegant and spacious mansions with an appearance much more akin to a village green in  New England  than the center of an urban business district. It was not until after the Civil War that commerce truly began to take a place in Buffalos economy; by the turn of the century, Lafayette Square, two blocks north of Church Street, was the home of large office buildings such as the Buffalo German Insurance Company and the Mooney Brisbane Building. The business districts boundary continued to creep further north during the first part of the 20th Century; at the onset of the Depression, Niagara Square was an odd mishmash, with the remaining mansions standing side by side with tall skyscrapers like the twelve-story Buffalo Athletic Club, the 19-story Hotel Statler, and the then brand-new City Hall, which, at a height of 398 feet (121m), is still the second-tallest building in Buffalo.   The effects of urban renewal in downtown Buffalo: the Tishman Building (left) was built in 1958 in the name of "urban renewal" on the site of the lovely old Buffalo German Insurance Company, but is widely considered a bland eyesore and has been abandoned since 2003. The Rand Building (right) is a beautifully restored—and fully occupied—Art Deco skyscraper from 1929.   However, things were slowly beginning to change. Though World War II saw Buffalos steel mills and automotive plants working at full force, a number of factors converged after the war that stymied, and finally reversed, Buffalos growth. In downtown specifically, the Main Street retail corridor began to grow less and less crowded each year as shoppers began to pass up grand old department stores like Adam, Meldrum and Anderson, the William Hengerer Company, and L. L. Berger in favor of suburban plazas and malls. Sadly, the response of Buffalos civic leaders to the decline of downtown was the same as their response to the deterioration in other neighborhoods: "urban renewal", for the most part poorly thought out and incredibly destructive. Among the many examples of the devastation of downtowns urban fabric was the demolition of the stunning, castlelike Erie County Savings Bank building to make way for the Main Place Tower, a bland modernist office tower with an attached suburban-style shopping mall, the razing of Cyrus Eidlitzs Buffalo Public Library, a beautiful Romanesque edifice in red sandstone at the east end of Lafayette Square, to be replaced by the drab monolith that houses the Central Library today, and the replacement of the beautiful French Second Empire-style Buffalo German Insurance Company with the minimalist, boxlike Tishman Building, which as of this writing has stood abandoned for nearly a decade.  By 2000, signs of hope had begun to emerge. Buffalos preservationist movement, which was kickstarted in 1950 with the citys shortsighted demolition of Frank Lloyd Wrights glorious Larkin Administration Building, had gained strength all through this time as their list of successes in preventing future disasters of that type grew. Thanks to their efforts, downtown Buffalo retains many splendid old buildings that would otherwise have been demolished. More importantly, the failure of Robert Moses-style urban renewal to address Buffalos decline has inspired the citys leaders to adopt a new strategy for development, favoring a more broad-based approach that has already borne fruit in similar Rust Belt cities like  Cleveland  and  Pittsburgh . Without this epiphany, West Chippewa Street would likely still be overrun with seedy bars, prostitutes and other unsavory characters, Canalside would likely still be a desolate patchwork of parking lots and moribund warehouses, and downtown in general would likely still be replete with boarded-up storefronts and a virtual ghost town after the end of the workday and on weekends. The most recent phase in downtowns renaissance, beginning over the past decade, has been the conversion of disused office space into high-end downtown apartments and condominiums—a commodity for which many Buffalonians have been surprised to discover there is considerable pent-up demand.</field>

		<field name="title">Buffalo/Allentown and the Delaware District</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Allentown takes its name from Lewis Allen, a native of  Westfield , Massachusetts who arrived in Buffalo in 1827 and established an orchard and cattle farm on a 29-acre (10.5ha) parcel that fronted on Williamsville Road, now Main Street. It was only six years later that Allen moved his farm to a parcel he had just purchased on  Grand Island , selling his former plot to developers hungry for new land for development for the growing city of Buffalo. Allens land was soon joined on the market by a massive portion of the land belonging to future Mayor Ebenezer Walden; located on what is now the southern fringe of Allentown, Waldens land straddled what was then the border between the newly incorporated City of Buffalo and the Village of Black Rock, which was annexed by Buffalo in 1854.    Allen Street was once the path by which Lewis Allen drove his cattle from the pasture owned by his neighbor Thomas Day (where Days Park is today) to his farmhouse on Main Street.   Meanwhile, the Delaware District, located relatively further from downtown than Allentown, began to urbanize slightly later; it remained farmland until 1868, when Buffalos northern border was extended from North Street to Ferry Street. Fortuitously for the neighborhood, the following decades saw probably the most rapid growth of population and economy in Buffalos history. The explosive growth of commerce and industry made millionaires out of many of Buffalos citizens, and among the newly urbanizing outskirts of the city, the Delaware District was the most popular place for these newly minted aristocrats to build their homes: "Millionaires Row" was well away from the congestion and bustle of downtown, yet directly connected to it via the broad, straight Delaware Avenue. The development by Frederick Law Olmsted of an extensive system of parks and parkways in Buffalo, with Delaware Park as its centerpiece, brought rapid urbanization to the northern part of the Delaware District, with still more lavish residences constructed along Chapin Parkway and on the streets immediately adjacent to Delaware Park beginning in the 1890s.   The beginning of the 20th Century saw the Delaware District and Allentown at the height of their fortunes, with Delaware Park playing host to the Pan-American Exposition—what many characterize as Buffalos shining hour—in 1901. However, the area, along with the rest of Buffalo, eventually began to stagnate and decline: the period of deindustrialization and suburbanization that began after World War II, along with the mass exodus of Americans from the often cold and snowy Northeast to the sunnier climates of the West and South, saw Millionaires Row abandoned by many of its titular residents for the suburbs or (more likely) other cities. Allentown, never having truly recovered from the Wall Street crash of 1929, for several decades verged on being an outright slum before its rediscovery in the 1950s by an emerging community of artists and bohemians (including what would come to be called "beatniks"), a reawakening that culminated in the founding of the North Street Association in 1960, which was soon renamed the Allentown Association.   However, the decline of Allentown and the Delaware District was not nearly as severe as that of other parts of the city; it was the location of this district on the west side of Main Street, and particularly along the still-elegant Delaware Avenue, that was its deliverance. Remarkably, with the exception of the noisy, intrusive Scajaquada Expressway which was routed through Olmsteds Delaware Park in 1961, the urban renewal that permanently scarred or altered other areas of the city barely touched Allentown and the Delaware District. For example, construction of the West Side Arterial, a proposed highway that would have run through Allentown near Virginia Street connecting the Kensington Expressway with Interstate 190, was opposed relentlessly by a grassroots coalition of community groups and was finally cancelled in 1976. Also, IBMs proposal to demolish three of the most sumptuous mansions on Delaware Avenue—the Forman-Cabana House, the George B. Matthews House, and the Richmond-Lockwood House—to make way for corporate offices was stymied and finally cancelled by the Delaware Avenue Historic Districts nomination in 1974, and official addition in 1980, to the National Register of Historic Places.  In the present day, the stately homes on Oakland Place, Linwood Avenue, Chapin Parkway, and other streets in the Delaware District, as well as the charming red-brick Victorians of Allentown, are still largely occupied by residents; these neighborhoods, more than most in the city, have gained a new cachet during recent years as urban life has belatedly come back into vogue among citizens of Western New York and elsewhere in the so-called Rust Belt. Also still standing are the mansions of Millionaires Row, though most of these have been converted to the well-cared-for headquarters of local corporations and not-for-profit groups.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">North Buffalos location further from  downtown  than any other part of the city, as well as its poorly drained topography, conspired to make it the last part of Buffalo to urbanize. Being located at the foot of the Onondaga Escarpment in what was once the bed of a glacial lake, the marshy land of North Buffalo—or the Buffalo Plains, as the area was called in the early days—made it far less suitable for agriculture than the ground above that low ridge of flint. Cornelius Creek, which roughly followed the course of todays Hertel Avenue, traversed North Buffalo until sometime in the 1880s, when it was buried as part of the citys storm drain system. An outpost of civilization in this wilderness was the Great Iroquois Trail (todays Main Street), which was an important thoroughfare between Buffalo and points east such as  Williamsville  and  Clarence Hollow  that ran along the crest of the escarpment. Like the aforementioned hamlets, the farmsteads along that road played an important role in the War of 1812 as refuges for residents of Buffalo and  Black Rock  which were burned by the British in December 1812, and, in the case of Dr. Daniel Chapins farm in what is now Parkside, as the site of the Flint Hill Encampment, where the Army of the Frontier under General Alexander Smythe spent that same winter. However, even as the city to its south grew astronomically, North Buffalo remained a rural backwater even well after 1868, the year Frederick Law Olmsted laid out the centerpiece of Buffalos park system, Delaware Park, on land just south of here.    Located at 2540 Main Street in the Vernon Triangle, the Washington Adams Russell House was built in 1841 and is thus the oldest extant building in North Buffalo. This old farmhouse, now a church, is a vestige of the days when Main Street was a major thoroughfare between Buffalo and the frontier villages to its north and east, such as Williamsville and Clarence. At the time of its construction, the house stood on 200 acres (81ha) of farmland abutting the Onondaga Escarpment; it remained in the hands of the Russell family for over forty years thereafter.   It was the construction of the New York Central Railroads Belt Line in 1882—a 15-mile (24km) loop intended to enable residents of Buffalos outskirts to commute to jobs downtown—that spurred the beginning of urbanization in North Buffalo. As early as 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted had planned to follow up the success of Delaware Park with a development he called Parkside, a verdant residential neighborhood adjacent to the park that would serve as a buffer between the pastoral park system and the bustle and congestion of the city. Now, with the construction of the railroad having driven up property values, construction of Parkside could begin in earnest. By the turn of the century, the ample houses of Parkside were occupied by a growing number of Buffalos richest citizens—including Larkin Soap Company executive Darwin D. Martin, who moved into a substantial home on Jewett Parkway designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Immediately north of Parkside, across the tracks of the Belt Line, local business magnate Lewis Bennett had success with Central Park, a similarly upscale neighborhood situated on his former estate that he developed beginning in 1890.  It was not until after 1900, however, that the development of North Buffalo came to full fruition. Despite the success of Parkside and Central Park, when the Pan-American Exposition was held in 1901, the remainder of North Buffalo was still sparsely populated farmland. However, the presence of visitors who came by the tens of thousands to the Exposition—many of whom arrived there via the Belt Line—spurred real estate speculators to buy up farmland in preparation for the inevitable rush of new residents. The Pan-American Exposition, a Worlds Fair that was intended to show off Buffalos industrial might, was held on a parcel of vacant land north of Delaware Park that Olmsted had earlier planned as a future western extension of Parkside. Afterward, beginning about 1920, the luxurious neighborhood known today as Park Meadow was laid out on the former Exposition grounds.  Elsewhere in North Buffalo, the University of Buffalo purchased the 153-acre (61ha) site of the former Erie County Alms House in the far northeast corner of the city in 1912, moving its rapidly growing campus there from downtown and setting off a similar land rush in what is now University Heights. Hertel Avenue, for its part, was becoming the neighborhood of choice for Buffalos Jewish community—mainly Orthodox Jews from  Russia  and elsewhere in Eastern Europe—who were gradually being displaced from their traditional homes on the  Near East Side  and in  Hamlin Park  by a growing African-American population.  World War II saw the last remaining bits of empty land in the city—including the area between Elmwood and Delaware Avenues north of the Belt Line, and along the south side of Kenmore Avenue west of Elmwood—eaten up with the construction of wartime factories (including the former Curtiss-Wright Plant 3 which still stands behind the Home Depot on Elmwood Avenue) and hastily-built housing for returning GIs. However, after the war, Buffalo, like many cities in the so-called Rust Belt, saw its formerly steady growth stagnate and decline. These were certainly trying times for North Buffalo; for instance, for the first time in its history the formerly posh neighborhood of Parkside found itself grappling with social issues such as slumlords and vacant buildings, which led to the foundation of the Parkside Community Association in 1963. But, by and large, North Buffalo was able to hang on better than other areas of the city. Aside from the construction of the Scajaquada Expressway in 1962 through verdant Delaware Park, the urban renewal that wrought havoc on other areas of the city left North Buffalo mostly unscathed—enabling the addition of the Parkside East Historic District and the Parkside West Historic District (i.e. Park Meadow) to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Meanwhile, the stabilizing presence of UB and its large and diverse student population did much to insulate University Heights from the ghettoization that ravaged adjacent  East Side  neighborhoods such as Kensington-Bailey and Kensington Heights in the 1960s and 70s.   Perhaps the greatest change to take place in North Buffalo at this time, however, was the gradual transition of Hertel Avenues ethnic character from Jewish to Italian, as the former group took up residence in the suburbs (principally  Amherst ) and the humble but friendly old Italian enclaves of the  Lower West Side  fell to the wrecking ball as part of a misguided urban renewal program, leaving their residents in search of a new home. This new identity for Hertel Avenue was formalized in 2011, when the city government erected signs proudly proclaiming the neighborhood as Buffalos official Little Italy. Indeed, Buffalos modest renaissance that began at the dawn of the 21st Century saw Hertel Avenue emerge as a lively strip of shops, restaurants and galleries to rival the Elmwood Village.</field>

		<field name="content">In the 1870s, citizens of southern Missouri began an era of extensive logging of the states native oak, hickory, and pine forests. Lumber mills were commonplace, but by the 1920s they had disappeared, along with much of the states native forests. Thus, in 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the MTNF into existence. In March 1933, he also created the Emergency Conservation Work Act, better known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In the area that would later become Mark Twain National Forest, hundreds of young men at over fifty CCC sites worked at building roads and planting hundreds of acres of pine to preserve and enhance the natural resources of southern Missouri. Many of their contributions can still be visited and enjoyed today.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">When the first Euro-American settlers came to Central Whidbey Island, they found a land tempered by centuries of human habitation. As early as 1300, the Skagit Indians had established permanent villages on the shores of Penn Cove. The island provided an abundance of natural resources for their sustenance—salmon, bottom fish, shellfish, berries, small game, deer, and water fowl. The Indians cultivated the prairies with selective burning, transplanting, and mulching to encourage the growth of favored root crops like bracken fern and camas. more than 1500 American Indians were recorded in the area in 1790. By 1904, the Indian population around Coupeville was reduced to a few small families.  Whidbey Island was named by explorer Captain George Vancouver in honor of his Lieutenant, Joseph Whidbey, who explored the island in a ships launch in 1792. Vancouvers well-publicized exploration of Puget Sound helped prepare the way for settlers to the area. A more important inducement was the Donation Land Law of 1850, which offered free land in Oregon Territory to any citizen who would homestead the land for four years. Newcomers flocked to the fertile prairies of Central Whidbey and, within three short years, had carved out irregularly-shaped claims that followed the lay of the best land. Today, this early settlement pattern can still be seen by the fence lines, roads, and ridges of the Reserve.  1934 photo of the Ferry House at Ebeys Landing   Colonel Isaac Neff Ebey was among the first of the permanent settlers to the island. Upon the advice of his friend Samuel Crockett, Ebey came west from his home in Missouri in search of land. Both men had filed donation claims on Central Whidbey by the spring of 1851. Ebey wrote home, enthusiastically urging his family to join him.  "My dear brother— I scarcely know how I shall write or what I shall write . . . the great desire of heart is to get my own and fathers family to this country. I think it would be a great move. I have always thought so . . . To the north down along Admiralty Inlet . . . the cultivating land is generally found confined to the valleys of streams with the exception of Whidbeys Island . . . which is almost a paradise of nature. Good land for cultivation is abundant on this island. I have taken a claim on it and am now living on the same in order to avail myself of the provisions of the Donation Law. If Rebecca, the children, and you all were here, I think I could live and die here content."  - Colonel Isaac Ebey, letter to his brother, W.S. Ebey, Olympia, Oregon, April 25, 1851  Colonel Isaac Neff Ebey (January 22, 1818 – August 11, 1857) was the first permanent white resident of Whidbey Island, Washington.  Ebeys family soon emigrated to the island. The simple home of Isaacs father Jacob, and a blockhouse he erected to defend his claim against Indians, still stand today overlooking the prairie that bears the family name. As for Isaac, he became a leading figure in public affairs, but his life was cut short in 1857, when he was slain by northern coastal Indians seeking revenge for the killing of one of their own chieftains.  Today some farmers of Central Whidbey still plow donation land claims established by their families in the 1850s. Their stewardship of the rich alluvial soil preserves a historic pattern of land use centuries old.  Fertile farmland was not the only incentive to settlement. Sea captains and merchants from New England were drawn to the protected harbor of Penn Cove and the stands of tall timber valued for shipbuilding. Many brought their families and took up donation claims along the shoreline. One colorful seafaring man was Captain Thomas Coupe, who startled his peers by sailing a full-rigged ship through treacherous Deception Pass on the north end of the island. In 1852, Coupe claimed 320 acres which later became the town of Coupeville on the south shore of the cove.  The early success of Central Whidbeys farming and maritime trade transformed Coupeville into a dominant seaport. The past remains apparent in Coupeville today, with its many 19th-century false-fronted commercial buildings on Front Street, its historic wharf and blockhouse, and its rich collection of Victorian residential architecture.  The military introduced another layer of history to the landscape of Central Whidbey, with the construction of Fort Casey Military Reservation in the late 1890s. Built on the bluff above Admiralty Head, Fort Casey was part of a three-fort defense system designed to protect the entrance to Puget Sound.  The first contingent of U.S. Army troops reported for duty in 1900, and eventually numbered 400. The fort became a social center for the surrounding community, hosting ball games, dances, and other social events. Today, the handsome wood-framed officers quarters, the gun escarpments, Admiralty Head Lighthouse, and other remnants of military history still stand at old Fort Casey.  Near the north boundary of the Reserve is Fort Ebey, a remnant of the defensive build-up of World War Two. To the south, the 1943 Coupeville Outlying Landing Field is still used today, providing aircraft carrier landing practice for Navy pilots.</field>

		<field name="name">landscape</field>
		<field name="content">The landscape of the Reserve, with its pattern of field, forest, and shoreline, has a quiet kind of beauty all its own. Part of this beauty lies in the diversity of its land forms, and vegetation. Within the boundaries of the 17,400-acre Reserve there are five distinctive character areas which together comprise the natural landscape. Overlaying each of these are the tangible reminders of mans presence upon the land.   Coastal Strip - on the western shore of the Reserve, along Admiralty Inlet, is an eight-mile strip of narrow beach that gives way to dramatic bluffs and low ravines. The elevation ranges from seal level to just over 200 feet. Many of the bluffs are sparsely vegetated, relatively unstable, and constantly eroding. Access to the fragile bluffs is limited to a trail that runs through State Park property along the crest of the bluff, meeting The Nature Conservancy property and then NPS lands. Please stay on the trail to prevent erosion from occurring.   Prairies- Three large natural prairies cover over 5000 acres of the Reserve. These prairies formed over 13,000 years ago by the receding glaciers. All are defined by ridges that embrace the rich fertile soils, an especially valuable resource. About one-third of the prairie lands are planted in squash, grains, forage, seed and feed crops. The remainder are a mixture of wetlands, pastures, woodlands, and farmsteads. Together these features form a cohesive character area, one that holds the telling physical remnants of human history-old fence lines, hedgerows, orchards, field patterns, weathered barns, and historic farmhouses.   Woodlands- Two large, densely wooded areas on the Reserve comprise just over 4500 acres. These forests are primarily second and third-growth Douglas fir and Western red cedar, with an understory of alder, salal, and rhododendron. Steep-sided, glacial-melt depressions called kettles, some over 200 feet deep, are found within these forested areas. With the exception of Fort Ebey State Park and Rhododendron Park, the woodlands of the Reserve remain relatively undeveloped and inaccessible.   Uplands - The upland areas of the Reserve are undulating, gently rolling hills that sweep up from the shorelines on either side of the island. Primarily pastures and cultivated fields carved out of woodland stands, these areas are sparsely settled with scattered farms and residences, forming a patchwork on the pastoral land.   Penn Cove- with its own special ambiance, covers over 4000 surface acres. This scenic shoreline changes from low beach front at Monroes Landing, to uplifted banks at Coupeville. Along the west edge of the cove, the lowlands shelter lagoons that provide a rich habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds. Modest beach cottages contribute to the peaceful setting at Good Beach and Snakelum Point, where permanent and seasonal residents enjoy the tranquility of the quiet cove.</field>

		<field name="content">Vegetation varies greatly from one end of Whidbey Island to the other. Vegetation in the south is more similar to that of mainland Washington. The principal trees are Douglas fir, red alder, bigleaf maple, western red cedar, and western hemlock. Compared to the rest of western Washington state, vine maple is notably absent, except where they have been planted. Other under-story plants include the evergreen huckleberry, lower longleaf Oregon grape, elderberry, salal, oceanspray, and varieties of nettle. Non-native introduced plants such as foxglove, ivy and holly are also evident.  Farther up the island, however, the shorter Oregon-Grape and the blue Evergreen Huckleberry is seen less, while tall Oregon-grape and Red Huckleberry predominate. The native Pacific rhododendron is much more visible. Amongst the deciduous varieties, Garry oak (from which Oak Harbor takes its name) are seen more frequently in the northern portion of the island and Pacific madrone is also notably present. In the conifer classification, grand fir is found more in the northern part of Whidbey Island along with Sitka spruce and shore pine. There are three open prairie areas on Whidbey Island – Smith Prairie, Crockett Prairie and Ebey Prairie.</field>

Layers of clothing, including a sweater, are recommended for changing conditions that include wind and rain. A pair of sturdy walking shoes is also advised.  Whidbey Island lies partially in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountain Range to the west, and has a variety of climate zones. This can be observed by rainfall amounts – wettest in the south with average rainfall of 36 inches (910 mm), driest in the central district of Coupeville where Ebeys Landing is located with average rainfall of 20 to 22 inches (510 to 560 mm), and turning moister again farther north with average rainfall of 32 inches (810 mm).</field>

		<field name="name">history</field>
		<field name="content">Although settled earlier by homesteaders such as Steve Grover in 1862, Moclips was not incorporated until 1905 with the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway and the first Moclips Beach Hotel built by Dr. Edward Lycan. The hotel was a two story, 150 room beachside resort. It burned down in 1905, just months after it was completed. Dr. Lycan then had a new, larger hotel built on the same site. It was three stories high, a block long, it loomed from the dunes. This Moclips Beach Hotel was completed in 1907 and advertised as having 270 “outside” rooms, with 2,000 ft (610 m) of 10 ft (3.0 m) covered veranda, and a perfect view of the Pacific Ocean, reported to be just 12 feet (3.7 m) from the hotel grounds. This close proximity to the ocean, however, would prove its undoing.  Back then Moclips was publicized as a healthy get away from the toil and trouble of city life. It was a health resort. The moist salt air and bathing in the surf was touted as very medicinal. A promotional pamphlet of the time purports Moclips’ climate to be “simply perfect”. Dr. Lycan believed that Moclips was the Mecca for health and pleasure of the Northwest.  Moclips grew into a sizable town with restaurants, hotels, a candy store, theater, canneries, and the M.R. Smith Lumber and Shingle Mill. Many hotels, schools, canneries and shingle mills were quickly built. Four schools once taught children from Taholah to Ocean Shores. Class schedules for the local schools were based on the clamming tides. Two of these buildings exist today.  In 1911 Moclips was struck by a series of fatal storms, eventually washing much of the town away. Moclips Beach Hotel stood in pieces. By the end of 1913, there was nothing left of the hotel. Fires destroyed much of Moclips along the beach. In 1948 a hilltop welding accident destroyed many homes and businesses.</field>

After the time of Spanish missions and Mexican ranchos, Samuel Brannan bought 2000 acres, founding Calistoga and starting the Indian Springs resort.  The resort eventually went into the hands of Doctor John Wilkinson, the founder of the spa industry.  Due to the spa industry, the California wine boom of the 1970s (which Calistoga is responsible for through Chateau Montelena Winerys surprise Chardonnay win at the 1976 French blind tasting,) the ensuing tourism, and the proximity to San Francisco (which in turn has fueled more tourism,) Calistoga, like the rest of the Napa Valley, has maintained very high property value which has increased the cost of living and essentially the price of everything from coffee to gasoline.</field>

It was named for a natural spring rich in iron ore located in  The Glen Helen . Legend has it that if you drink from the spring you will always return.  In the conservative stronghold of Southwest Ohio not far from a major air force base, Yellow Springs has the reputation for being an island of left-wing activism supported by its small liberal arts school, Antioch College.  Some locals go as far as to call it the  Berkeley  of Ohio.  When school is in session people watching is an interesting event given the personalities this college attracts.  The Village offers some of the best dining in the Dayton area, along with several artisan groups and a downtown bustling with side-walk shops. All of this lies a short distance from  Ohios best natural area, including  John Bryan State Park  and Glen Helen.   The Village can get quite congested on warm-weathered weekends, but nearly all of its attractions are open during weekdays, which offer less in the way of crowds. As of the 2000 census the population was 3,761.</field>

		<field name="content">The City of Chino is centrally located in the western portion of the Inland Empire, in the lush valley below the San Gabriel Valley Mountains. Incorporated as a city in 1910, Chino is a well-established residential and commercial area with beautiful neighborhoods, diverse demographics, irresistible hometown charm and a well-rounded business mix.  Chino’s rich agricultural history dates back to the Spanish land grant forming Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. The area specialized in orchard and row crops and was the number one dairy area in the United States. The City’s motto, “Where Everything Grows” originally referred to this agricultural beginning. Today it applies to growth in families, business and the strong sense of community. Commercial and industrial growth has been a significant success in Chino, due in large part to the City’s development friendly philosophy. New businesses are attracted to Chino because it offers modern facilities, reasonable lease rates, competitive labor costs and un-congested access to logistic centers such as Ontario International Airport, UPS, several cross-dock trucking hubs and the BNSF intermodal rail yard in San Bernardino. The 60, 71 and 91 freeways also bound Chino. Additionally, Chino has its own municipal airport which is host to the renowned Chino Air Show each year.  The City of Chino is within 30 minutes of 21 private and public colleges and universities. Chaffey College opened a satellite center in the city and built a $4 million information technology center in Downtown Chino. Chaffey College also plans to build a 100-acre campus in Chino to serve local communities.  As the agricultural preserve is developed, Chino’s growth will continue. Our Community Services is dedicated to accommodating the growth in population, while continuing to provide a high level of service that is unsurpassed in the Inland Empire. Chino’s full-service, community oriented Police Department is closely connected to our growing community as well, through its proactive problem solving and community partnerships.  The City of Chino’s mission statement is” Together we take pride in providing quality, caring service to our community.” City staff is dedicated to this mission statement and maintains their commitment to excellence in customer service. As the City looks to an exciting future, Chino will encourage balanced growth and strive to maintain its cultural heritage and hometown atmosphere.</field>

		<field name="content">Oak Harbors history goes back to the early 1850s, when two settlers staked claims where the city now stands—Zakarias Martin Taftezon, a shoemaker from Norway; C.W. Sumner from New England Houses and businesses sprouted up along the shores of Oak Harbor as the pioneers relied entirely on water transportation until the 1900s. For the next thirty years, steamers and freighters carried passengers and freight from the Island to the mainland and back as well as Fidalgo Island to the north.  The Irish came in the late 1850s, making Oak Harbor grow and prosper as they fished and farmed the area, and the citys Dutch heritage arrived in the 1890s. Churches, schools, and more businesses followed the arrival of the Dutch. A high school was built in 1906. Oak Harbor flourished as a small country town until Deception Pass Bridge and the U.S. Navy Base connected the city to the rest of the region and the world.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The area which is now Vicksburg was previously part of the Natchez Native Americans territory. The first Europeans who settled the area were French colonists, who built Fort-Saint-Pierre in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River at present-day Redwood. In 1790 the Spanish founded a military outpost on the site, which they called Fort Nogales (nogales meaning "walnut trees"). When the Americans took possession in 1798, they changed the name to Walnut Hills. A sprawling community developed which officially incorporated in 1825 as Vicksburg. It was named after Newitt Vick, a Methodist minister. Vicksburg experienced rapid growth during the expansion of the cotton trade in the American South. Cotton was grown most profitably in the Mississippi Delta region. Vicksburg sits at the southern most tip of the Mississippi Delta, and served as a production and commerce hub for the cotton industry. In the decades leading up to the American Civil War, Vicksburg became very affluent from the large number of Delta planters and merchants making considerable profits selling cotton to European and North American textile producers.  Vicksburg is most famous as the location of a 47 day siege during the American Civil War (May 18 – July 4, 1863). After federal naval forces on the Mississippi River made several attempts at passing the rebel batteries at Vicksburg, Ulysses S. Grant led the federal army on a campaign to put the Confederate garrison at Vicksburg to siege. The people of Vicksburg dug caves into the hillsides to survive the bombardment. The legacy of the siege lives through much of Vicksburgs art, museum exhibits and traditions.  Vicksburg was instrumental in the growth and propagation of American Blues music-- which is native to  Mississippi . Blues evolved primarily in the Mississippi Delta region from the musical traditions of African-American slaves before the American Civil War. Vicksburg served as a central hub for musicians to perform for merchants and travelers in the music halls and "juke joints" near the river port at Vicksburg.  Today Vicksburg remains distinct as a place where travelers can experience the legacy and traditions of the American South in a quaint city overlooking the Mississippi River. The people of Vicksburg are very hospitable and love to pass down stories from generations past that will bring history to life. The pace of life remains much slower than in many other places in the United States. There are many activities in Vicksburg from cultural and historical venues, as well as historic Washington Street full of restaurants and consignment shops of antiques. Be sure to get out of the car and explore - Vicksburg has beautiful architecture and a warm, friendly environment for walking.   250px   250px   250px</field>

		<field name="title">Bandelier National Monument</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">As with other units of the national park system, Bandelier was created for both conservation and recreation.  The primary resources being conserved are cultural (archaeological and anthropological) and scenic (canyon and mesa country, merging into mountain scenery at the upper end of the park).  Both follow from Bandeliers setting atop the Pajarito Plateau, a gigantic, ancient (1-2 million year old) ash flow from a volcanic eruption in the nearby  Jemez Mountains , that over time has eroded into a network of canyons and mesas.  This rugged terrain is responsible for both the scenic beauty of the monument and the capacity of this otherwise arid landscape to maintain an indigenous population that lived along the streams in the canyons, and in some cases, on the mesa tops above them.  The early Puebloans have moved on to other locations in northern New Mexico, but the ruins of their habitations and ceremonial structures remain to be protected by the monument.  The monuments headquarters, visitor center, and most accessible features are in Frijoles Canyon, a typical example of the canyons incised in the plateau, but notable for its abundance of ruins.  These result from the fact that in contrast to most canyons on the plateau, Frijoles has a stream in its bottom, the Rito de los Frijoles -- Bean Creek -- that runs nearly year-round.  (Most canyons have seasonal streams that dry up during parts of the year.)  Frijoles Canyon is also fairly wide for much of its length, and the combination of the resulting open spaces and available water allowed the ancestral Puebloans to practice agriculture relatively successfully.  Remnants of Puebloan agriculture can still be seen in the canyon, even though the dwellings were abandoned centuries ago.  Many of the ruins in Frijoles Canyon have been excavated, studied and preserved.  The main loop trail from the visitor center (see under "See") passes by several types of restored dwellings: communal stone structures along the canyon floor (think of a prehistoric "apartment complex"), "cliff houses" built of stone and mud backed against the canyon wall, and a few "cave dwellings" in holes in the volcanic tuff of the canyon wall.  Other archaeological features typical of the Puebloans are the religious structures known as kivas.  These are circular, half-buried structures that in Puebloan times would have had flat roofs and entrance ways.  Most kivas were perhaps 15 feet (5 meters) in diameter, but many Puebloan villages were built around a "great kiva" that was much larger.  An example of a great kiva has been restored in Frijoles Canyon.  Todays pueblos along the Rio Grande still use kivas in ceremonies.  All of these types of ruins can be found in some of the parks other areas, although most have not been restored; in fact, you may encounter archaeologists on the job at some sites (please dont disturb).  A note on terminology: The term "Anasazi" has frequently been used to describe the Puebloan culture.  Recently it has fallen out of favor, as it translates to "ancient enemy" or "enemies of our ancestors". The ancestral Puebloans were labeled "Anasazi" by rival tribes in the area.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Mission Peak is visible throughout Fremont.   Unlike most sprawling suburbs, Fremont was planned and designed to be the way it is. In the 1950s, fearing that they would be annexed by the growing city of  Hayward  to the north, eight very small towns decided to unite to avoid annexation.  Two towns (Alvarado and Decoto) closest to Hayward quickly incorporated into Union City.  The six remaining towns got together and extensively planned how things would be.  Space was allocated both for industry and homes. Space for roads large enough to support the massive traffic flows was set aside.  One of the small towns ( Newark ) dropped out of the coalition because it was slated to become an industrial zone.  The five remaining towns -- (Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San Jose, and Warm Springs, from north to south - annexed all the surrounding land to form the City of Fremont.  The oldest of the small towns was Mission San José, named for a Spanish mission founded in 1797.  When this Mission was founded it was named "La Mision del Gloriosisimo Patriarch San José" in honor of St. Joseph.  It is sometimes incorrectly called the Mission San José de Guadalupe, after "El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe" founded (1777) 20 miles south near the Guadalupe River, which became the present day city of San Jose.  Fremont has been multicultural since its inception, and is home to dozens of immigrant communities and a broad range of ethnicities.  Todays visitor is likely to hear half a dozen languages spoken even during a fleeting trip through the city.  It is said that the largest population of Afghanis outside Afghanistan live in Fremont, and it also has a large and growing south Asian community as well.  Because of their entangled history and their present sprawl that makes them blend into one another, the three cities—Fremont, Newark, and Union City—are sometimes called the Tri-Cities.</field>

"The Quarter" is compact. One can spend an enjoyable vacation here without leaving it for several days. If the French Quarter is your headquarters, consider leaving your car behind and not bothering to rent one if your health permits a few blocks walk. Parking is difficult, expensive, or both. Occasional trips to other parts of town can be made by streetcar or cab. The neighborhood is pedestrian friendly. Take care walking at night, particularly on dark or deserted streets. If youve been drinking, a cab is advisable.  The "Upper Quarter" (between Canal Street and Jackson Square) is the area most patronized by visitors, but the "Lower Quarter" (between Jackson Square and Esplanade Avenue) also has shops and restaurants sprinkled amongst the residences.   Jackson Square is the historic heart of the French Quarter</field>

It is also a nice getaway resort area away from the congested Cleveland, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh metro areas about 50-150 miles west, east, and southeast of Ashtabula county. Ashtabula is located along Lake Erie and is prone to the local weather patterns from the lake. Lake Erie bring a pleasant cool breeze in the summer but cold snowy conditions in the winter. Ashtabula county falls within the snowbelt region and gets a good amount of lake effect snow activity during that season. Snow can be fairly deep and travel conditions during that season can be fairly hazardous. If traveling to this region during winter keep that in mind. The snowfall can be rather beautiful and opens up the recreational potential to cross country skiing, sled riding, and ice skating. Also Ashtabula county celebrates Christmas in style in many of the towns with Christmas themed shops and Christmas tree farms.</field>

Located at an elevation of 4118 feet on Main Street, Kelsey promoted Highlands on the basis of its healthy air and excellent potential for orchards and gardens. Because of its cool climate and scenic beauty, it quickly became a popular location for historic inns and churches, golf courses, seasonal homes, and a unique and thriving downtown business area.  While many small towns are trying to stimulate commerce, Highlands is in the enviable position of needing to manage its high rate of growth. The downtown is successful because of its quaint shops and restaurants, clean environment, and rustic atmosphere that is not overstated. For many people, the downtown serves as a focus for social interaction, and the Town has strived in its general layout and streetscape to invite people to mingle and window shop.</field>

For clarity we will also include Bainbridge, Blake and other nearby islands in this entry.  The region has a rich and diverse history. Giving a combination of Native American, Scandinavian, military and pioneer attractions.  The Kitsap Peninsula is "almost" an island, accessible primarily by ferries or bridges with highway access from the south.   Kitsap County  is the governmental body covering the majority of the Peninsula, with  Pierce County  lying in the SE portion of the Peninsula, and  Mason County  lying in the SW portion of the Peninsula.

Somers has always been an agricultural town with many potato, tobacco, and dairy farms and there are many animals and ranches. For example, horseback riding is a very big in Somers. Somers is a very wealthy town with beautiful houses, in 2007 it was named 53rd on Money Magazine’s list of 100 Best Places to Live.  The people of Somers are all very close with one another, mainly because of the fact that it is such a small town. There is only one elementary, middle, and high school in the whole town and they are ll right together in the same area. So, basically everyone in the town knows one another. The Somers community always comes together in times of need, one major thing that has happened that will help you understand this town is the recent incident in 2012 where the Somers Congregational Church was set on fire. The people of Somers all came together to support and help one another out.  Somers is a great little country town but there can also be a lot to do if you just look a little closer.</field>

		<field name="content">Understanding New Mexico starts with grasping the overpowering importance of two of its geological features: the Rio Grande, which bisects the state north to south, and the nearby  Sangre de Cristo Mountains , southernmost range of the  Rocky Mountains  and a part of the same large-scale geological structure that produces the Rio, the "Rio Grande rift."  The eastern third of the state is an extension of the  Great Plains  both geographically and culturally and has more in common with the western parts of  Texas  and  Oklahoma  than with the rest of New Mexico.  The western third, beyond the Rio and the assortment of minor mountain ranges (Nacimientos, Magdalenas, and the not-so-minor  Jemez Mountains ) to its west, is part of the same " basin and range " geography as comprises much of  Arizona  and  Nevada , with a little  Utah  canyon country thrown in toward the northwest corner.  Its the area in between these two sparsely inhabited regions that gives the state much of its identity, houses the majority of its population, and contains many of its travel attractions.  The "Rio Grande Corridor" starts at the  Colorado  state line and includes (from north to south) such well-known places as   Taos ,  Los Alamos ,  Santa Fe ,  Albuquerque , and  Las Cruces  at the southern end of the state.  Travelers who have seen only the flat emptiness of the eastern side or the rugged desolation of the western third simply do not expect this region, with its snowcapped mountains, fertile riparian habitat along the Rio, and a population density that, while not high by the standards of the United States (let alone Europe), is still unusual in the Southwest.  Most of the states many American Indian reservations (the  pueblos ) are here ( Navajo Nation , however, is in the  northwest  region), as are the most conspicuous remnants of the Spanish influence resulting from the states ties to  Mexico  that persisted into the 19th century.  At the same time, the relative prosperity of this area (although no part of New Mexico can really be considered "wealthy" except in isolated neighborhoods) is making several of its communities into high-tech centers, for example the Albuquerque suburb of Rio Rancho that houses a great manufacturing plant for computer components.  The Sangre de Cristos and Jemez also create a relatively cool and moist (at least compared to the rest of the state) climate zone in which snow can persist in the highest mountains nearly year-round.  There is also a more subtle north/south dichotomy to the culture and geography that breaks basically along the route of Interstate highway 40, which follows the historic  Route 66  across the state.  Most of the north/south differences (apart from the observation that the north is higher and cooler than the south) are political in nature and affect residents more than travelers, but they lead to the state self-identifying the six regions given under the "Regions" heading of this article.  Note that there is no "South Central" region; the Rio Grande Corridor narrows toward the southern end of the state, and features along the southern Rio are treated in the  southwest region .</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Smithfield is a small town in Northern Rhode Island that was founded in the 1600’s as a farming town. Smithfield was named after John Smith, "The Miller", who was granted land by the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams. Prior to his arrival, Smithfield was originally known as Wionkhiege by the Wampanoag Tribe who utilized the land for its vast hunting and fishing land. Now the town still has the charm of an old farming village with orchards and farms scattered throughout, but it has since been modernized to a mid-size suburban town. The town is also known for its historic mill history. Smithfield’s public schools consist of Smithfield High School, Gallagher Middle School, Old County Elementary school, William Winsor Elementary School, Anna McCabe Elementary School, and La Perch Elementary School. It is made up of six historic villages including Georgiaville, Mountaindale, Esmond, Greenville, Hanton City, and Stillwater. The town is a great place to visit especially in the autumn months for its farms and orchards (known for their apple orchards especially). It is also has many unique places and family-owned businesses that make visitors feel like they are home no matter how far they’ve traveled from.</field>

		<field name="content">Newton is made up of 13 "villages" or neighborhoods, including Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Lower Falls, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, Newtonville, Nonantum, Oak Hill, Thompsonville, Upper Falls, Waban, and West Newton.  While mainly a suburb of Boston, it is a sizable city in its own right, boasting a population of over 80,000.  Each village has its own historical and architectural character. Many of the villages grew up around railroad stations after the Boston Worcester Railroad opened up through the north side of Newton in 1833. Another railroad line opened up across the south side of Newton in 1851 and is the "D" Branch of the MBTAs Green Line today. Walking tours of most villages are available through the website of the Newton City Planning Department  .  Striking enclaves of Victorian houses and Gothic Revival churches can be seen in Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, and Newtonville, and West Newton Hill. Newtons grandest boulevard is Commonwealth Avenue, which winds through the entire city and is lined with historic mansions.  "Comm Ave," as it is known to Bostonians, connects Boston to Weston and serves as the route of the Boston Marathon (Patriots Day, third Monday of April). Heartbreak Hill begins just east of Newton City Hall.  Divided down the middle by a landscaped mall that runs throughout the city, the street was designed by celebrated landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmstead, who also designed Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston.  For trivia buffs: in 1886, Nabiscos Fig Newton cookie was named after the City of Newton.</field>

		<field name="content">Besides being the center of the modern wine-making industry in Sonoma County, the town of Sonoma has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. Spanish colonial settlers first established one of their northernmost missions in 1823 when the Mission San Francisco Solano was founded by a Spanish priest, Father Joseph Altimira. The Mission was the first, last, and only California mission established under newly-independent Mexican rule. For a brief period in 1846 it was the capital of the short-lived California Republic. Today, Sonoma, with a little over 10,000 people, attracts thousands of visitors each year as a jumping point to the vineyards that surround the town.  Sonoma is a town consisting of wealthy retirees and wine industry celebrities, Latin American and Nepalese immigrants (yes, Sonoma has one of the largest populations of Nepalese people outside of Nepal!), and tourists. It has a more laid back vibe than its big boasting neighbour Napa, and offers wine country cuisine, lifestyle and experience at a slightly more affordable and less Hollywood style environment.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The village of Bonners Ferry was formally established in 1893, along the south bank of the Kootenai River. Scattered along the valley and benchland were a few ranches and homesteads. Numerous mines were developed in the nearby mountains, including the Continental Mine in the Selkirks. The lumber industry also grew rapidly. Bonners Ferry, perched on stilts to avoid the inevitable spring floods, appeared to be a boom town.  Moving into the 20th century, the town became the center of a lumbering and farming community. The valley land was drained, levees were constructed and farms were cleared on the benches. The rich Kootenai Valley became known as the "Nile of the North", while the Bonners Ferry Lumber Company grew to be one of the worlds largest lumber mills. The downtown took shape as brick buildings were constructed, replacing those on stilts. Completion of the Libby Dam in 1975 lessened the threat of serious flooding. Today, much of Main Street dates from this initial period of solid, permanent construction.</field>

		<field name="content">Originally a part of Indian Territory, Poteau can be traced back to around 1885 and is pronounced “po toe”.  If you ask a local how to say it, they may tell you it is what you say when you stub your toe. “Oh my po toe.” Poteau is a French word that means "post" or "pole". There are two different beliefs on how the city was named. One is it was a trading post and the other is the name came from the river and the story goes that when the French explorers arrived in the area they had to use poles to navigate the shallow waters of the Poteau River. The latter story seems move likely as the town was developed well after the French explorers arrived.  Poteau is "Above the Ordinary" in every way. As the gateway to the Ouachita and Kiamichi Mountains and home to many lakes and rivers, we offer outdoor recreation such as bass fishing, rodeo, fair grounds, hot air balloon festival, softball, baseball, soccer, hometown parades, 4th of July celebration, Bluegrass festival and many other events.</field>

		<field name="content">Whidbey Island was once inhabited by members of the Lower Skagit, Swinomish, Suquamish, Snohomish and other Native American tribes. The first known European sighting of Whidbey Island was during the 1790 Spanish expedition of Manuel Quimper and Gonzalo López de Haro on the Princesa Real. The island was fully explored in 1792 by Captain George Vancouver. In May of that year, Royal Navy officers and members of Vancouvers expedition, Joseph Whidbey and Peter Puget, began to map and explore the areas of what would later be named Puget Sound. After Whidbey circumnavigated the island in June 1792, Vancouver named the island in his honor.  Goose Rock Trail on Whidbey Island  The first known overnight stay on Whidbey Island by a non-native American was made on May 26, 1840 by a Catholic missionary during travel across Puget Sound.  Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842, sailed the USS Vincennes into Penn Cove in 1841. There he found the largest Native settlement on Puget Sound needed  and noted that a Catholic mission had been started with a 2-acre (8,100 m2) fenced garden. Wilkes named the lower cove Holmes Harbor, after his assistant surgeon, Silas Holmes.  In 1850, Colonel Isaac N. Ebey became the first permanent white settler on Whidbey Island, claiming a square mile (2.6 km²) of prairie with a southern shoreline on Admiralty Inlet. Even though he was farming potatoes and wheat on his land, he was also the postmaster for Port Townsend, Washington and rowed a boat daily across the inlet in order to work at the post office there. On August 11, 1857, Colonel Ebey was murdered and beheaded by Haida who traveled from the Queen Charlotte Islands when he was 39 years old. Ebey was slain in proxy-retaliation for the killing of a Haida chief at Port Gamble. Fort Ebey, named for the Colonel, was established in 1942 on the west side of the central part of the island, just northwest of Coupeville.</field>

There may not be much to do in any one location, but the county as a whole offers a variety of recreational and historical attractions, all within easy driving distance of each other.  The county owes much of its tourism to the Erie Canal, which runs east-west through several communities, and to Lake Ontario, which lies to the north.  Orleans Countys many creeks attract fishing enthusiasts from throughout the region.   Albion , the county seat, is located close to the middle of the county, and it makes a great jumping-off point for day trips.  Albion and  Medina  are the largest villages; both have quaint 19th-century canalside downtowns, with light commercial strips farther out.

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The history of the town dates back to 1637, when theologian Roger Williams established a trading post between two major Native American thoroughfares.  In 1674, “Kings Towne” was founded by the colonial government and included several present-day towns.  Kings Towne was the center of the King Philip’s War fought from 1675 to 1676. At the start of the 18th century, settlement increased so quickly that in 1722 the colonial government divided Kings Towne into North and South, with North Kingstown being the area of earliest settlement.  The seaport and colonial fishing village of Wickford was also established in the early 18th century.  The towns population grew during the second World War, when Quonset Naval Base was in full operation.  During this time, Quonset consisted largely of airplane hangars, barracks and other functional buildings.  After the base ceased to be full-functioning, many of these buildings were converted to house businesses and factories.  Over the past two decades the business park has become more developed and has brought industry to North Kingstown from all over the world.  Through use of its port, Quonset receives automobiles from across the world, including Germany and Japan.  Recently, the Quonset Gateway project has promoted the growth of the area by providing space for local retailers and high-tech industrial and commercial businesses.  To accommodate for these businesses and to improve the area, many of the WWII era-buildings have been destroyed or are currently in the process of being deconstructed.  However, adventurous visitors can still see some of the WWII-era buildings by simply driving or biking around the area.  Several Quonset Huts (named for the Native-American structure design they were inspired by) can be found near Alans Harbor.</field>

		<field name="content">300px  Venice was the creation and dream of one man, Abbott Kinney.  Kinney was an investor who built a sort of recreation of  Venice , Italy including a massive system of canals and a huge entertainment complex that opened in 1905 and became very popular.  The overly ambitious canals were mostly filled and made into streets in 1929.  A few of the canals survive and are lined with funky, expensive, and architecturally diverse urban homes.  A stroll along a couple of the remaining streets is a lesson in architectural ecclecticism.  Kinneys huge Pacific Ocean Park entertainment complex survived until the mid-1960s, eventually succumbing to competition from  Disneyland  and others.  The spirit of his seaside entertainment complex however, still pulses in Venices captivating Boardwalk.   In the 1950s and 60s, Venice became a center for the Beat generation. There was an explosion of poetry and art. Major participants included Stuart Perkoff, John Thomas, Frank T. Rios, Tony Scibella, Lawrence Lipton, John Haag, Saul White, and Philomene Long. Jim Morrison of The Doors also lived in Venice and wrote much of his poetry and song lyrics here.  In the late 60s, Venice became a center for radical activism, including a Black Panther chapter, a Free Venice (from Los Angeles) movement and many other activities opposing various urban renewal plans. Venice, today, is a community in the throes of gentrification but maintains a strong identity and progressive political posture.  More than one hundred years after Kinneys debut, Venice remains unique and well worth the visit.</field>

		<field name="content">Situated at the intersection of two state highways, Childs is like many other small hamlets scattered throughout Western New York.  But few such hamlets have what Childs has: a top-notch restaurant housed in an old stagecoach stop, comfortable bed-and-breakfast-style accommodations, and a unique museum complex steeped in history.  The hamlet was first known as Fair Haven, so named by founder John Proctor, who hoped to establish a thriving village at the most significant crossroads in the area.  He may have succeeded, except that five years later, the  Erie Canal  was routed less than three miles to the south, through  Albion , which became the county seat.  Even without the canal, though, Fair Haven remained a popular stagecoach stop along the Ridge Road, thanks to the tavern built in 1824 on the northwest corner of the intersection.  Before long, a church was built, then a one-room schoolhousemdash;both making good use of the plentiful cobblestones left behind by the retreating glaciers.  Several houses in the hamlet also made use of cobblestone construction.  Today, the Ridge remains a major arterial route, though it carries cars and trucks rather than stagecoaches, and the old tavern is still in use as a modern-day watering hole.  The school and the church are the centerpieces of The Cobblestone Museum, which aims to preserve that unique style of architecture for future generations.   You probably dont need this map to get around.</field>

		<field name="content">Cleveland is the urban center of  Northeast Ohio , the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States.  Throughout the twentieth century, the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. (from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics). Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.  However, in the mid-1980s, Cleveland earned the nickname the "Comeback City" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today. As its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the New American City as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.  Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you cant see the other side, i.e., Canada). Like other cities in the so-called "rust belt", Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy. While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum  Another thing non-locals dont often realize is that Clevelands long history of industrial wealth has left it chock full of cultural riches as well as the beginnings of a "sustainable city" movement.  Serving as a global model for urban rebirth, Cleveland has been named one of the top 10 international visitor hotspots by Travel and Leisure magazine. For decades, the city has boasted of: a "Big Five" orchestra ( The Cleveland Orchestra ),  the second largest performing arts center in the U.S. ( Playhouse Square Center ),  a world-renowned art museum ( The Cleveland Museum of Art ),  the nations first health museum ( HealthSpace Cleveland ),  RD hub of the aerospace and aviation industry (the  NASA Glenn Research Visitors Center ) and a number of other first-rate attractions (too many to mention here - read on).  During its "comeback" years, Cleveland has added: the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum , the  Great Lakes Science Center  with Omnimax theatre, and four new sports facilities in the downtown area - Progressive Field (Still known as "The Jake" after a recent corporate name change) for the Major League Baseball Indians, QuickenLoans Arena ("The Q") for the NBA Cavaliers, Cleveland Browns Stadium for the NFL Browns and the Wolstein Center for the Cleveland State University Vikings basketball team.</field>

		<field name="title">Kauai</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">In many ways, Kauai is different from the rest of the islands.  Its almost as if youve stepped into a separate kingdom, and for many years Kauai was just that in relation to Hawaii.  Kamehameha I was able to conquer all the islands by force, except Kauai.  Two separate campaigns to take the island ended in failure.  In the end, it took diplomacy, a royal kidnapping, and an arranged marriage to bring Kauai into the kingdom of Hawaii.  Kauai is also known as the place where the sugar cane industry in Hawaii was born.  Sugar was once the industrial mainstay of the Kauai economy but in recent years has taken a back seat to tourism. In October of 2009, Gay Robinson harvested the last sugar crop in Kauai, ending 117 years of the sugar business in Kauai.  In short, compared to  Oahu ,  Maui  or the  Big Island , Kauai is smaller, less populated, more rural, and more laid back.  Thats why its the favorite destination for many visitors to Hawaii, and for many Hawaii residents as well. Visitors come to explore the islands beaches and natural wonders, but the multitude of resorts on white sand beaches provide ample opportunity to just sit and do nothing if youre so inclined.  Because tourist development reached Kauai considerably later than the other islands, the island has a larger proportion of timeshares, condominiums, and bed and breakfasts.  Also, a strict cap on building heights (hotels can be no more than 40 feet high) prevent the development of the mega-resorts and towering skyscrapers found on the other islands.  The local rule is that nothing can be built taller than a coconut tree.  One look at a map will show you an important difference between Kauai and the more populous islands of Hawaii: Due to the massive Waimea Canyon and Na Pali Coast, no roads circle the island.  Once youve made the drive along the south shore to Waimea and seen the canyon, the only options are to go West on dirt roads to Polihale Beach or turn around and go back the way you came. Same story for Princeville and Na Pali on the north shore.  However, the island is compact enough that both ends of the road can be seen in the same day. But the Garden Island cannot be enjoyed or appreciated if you are pressed for time.  Kauai offers a very unique experience also—from the western coast of the island on one of its piers, in the far distance travelers can see the island of Niihau, which is the forbidden island—forbidden, that is, to all but residents (about 130 mostly Native Hawaiians), U.S. Navy personnel, government officials and invited guests.  It is often forgotten about because of its privacy so seeing its outline in the far distance is an amazing and majestic experience!  Also know that Kauai is a place where many famous people go to get away.  Since it is much less drastic of a plane ride from L.A. in California than it is from the East Coast, this island which is the most secluded, private and relaxing provides getaway homes to many stars, although the normal traveler wont see these celebrities out on the beach, probably because their beach-front properties provide their own private beaches.  To get a glimpse of one of these stars, check a nook in the wall bistro.  Celebrities like Beau Bridges can be found relaxing with his wife in the islands countryside restaurants.  Also visitors should beware of the fact that along many of Kauais streets and especially their main highway that there are wild roosters and chickens everywhere!  It is almost like the equivalent of seeing squirrels in more eastern parts of the United States.  Also, and quite surprisingly, stray cats are also everywhere in Kauai.</field>

		<field name="content">Tiverton has great streets to roam in  Founded in 1694, Tiverton has grown from its origins as a farming community into a picturesque summer resort and residential suburb.  The town was originally incorporated as a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  In 1746 the final settlement of a long colonial boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Massachusetts annexed Tiverton to Rhode Island by Royal Decree, along with bordering towns along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay: Barrington, Bristol and Little Compton, as well as the town of Cumberland, to the north of Providence. Tiverton was then incorporated as a town of Rhode Island in 1747. Until it’s annex, Tiverton controlled the area of East Freetown, Massachusetts as an outpost.  During the Revolutionary War men from the Tiverton outpost took part in the Battle of Freetown, on May 25, 1778.  For about three years,from December 1776 to late 1779, Rhode Island proper (also known as Aquidneck Island, historically) was occupied by the British.  During this time Tiverton became a refuge for Americans fleeing the occupation, a mustering place for Colonial forces gathering to drive away the British.  The occupying forces eventually withdrew strategically, as General Clinton marshalled his forces for the 1780 British invasion of South Carolina.  In its early days, Tiverton was chiefly a farming community, with some fishing and boat construction.  Until 1900 the manufacture of menhaden oil, a fish derivative, was one of the town’s primary industrial pursuits.  Cotton and woolen mills were established as early as 1811, when Colonel Joseph Durfee built a spinning mill at Cook Pond in what it now the city of Fall River, Massachusetts.  In 1856, the northern part of the town separated from Tiverton and was re-named Fall River, Rhode Island by the Rhode Island General Assembly. Then, on March 1, 1862, in a decision made by the United States Supreme Court, Fall River was made part of Massachusetts, and the state boundary placed in its current location along State Avenue.  Marks Stadium is a former soccer stadium located in North Tiverton, Rhode Island. During the 1920s and early 1930s it was the home of Fall River Marksmen, one of the era’s most successful soccer teams. It is one of the earliest examples of a soccer-specific stadium in the United States. After the demise of the Marksmen, the stadium was used as a home ground by other local teams, most notably Fall River F.C. and Ponta Delgada S.C..</field>

		<field name="content">First settled in 1630 by English Puritans, Cambridge developed as an agricultural town and was not really convenient to Boston until bridges were built over the Charles River in 1793 and 1809. The latter of these opened up East Cambridge for industrial development led by furniture and glass factories. A major influx of penniless Irish immigrants fleeing the potato blight in 1845 increased the Irish population to 22 per cent in the next ten years. Toward the end of that century they were followed by immigrants from Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Germany. French Canadians and Russian Jews also came at this time. A small African American population had been growing from colonial times, attracted by the integrated schools.  The result today is a highly diverse population augmented and further diversified by brilliant men and women drawn to Cambridge over the years by Harvard, Radcliffe and M.I.T., and, in recent years, by the local high technology companies. "Cantabrigians" (from the citys Latin name, Cantabrigia) are regarded as progressive and tolerant. Decline of the industrial base in the early 1900s led Cambridge to become an intellectual center. Universities are the major employers, but cutting edge companies in information technology and biotechnology such as Akamai Technologies, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Novartis are located adjacent to the MIT campus in the Kendall Square area.   Cambridge now advertises itself as "a city where counter-culture still lives, classic culture thrives, and multicultural is a way of life."

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Durango has a long and rich history. The city was founded in 1880 by the Denver Rio Grande Railroad. By July of 1882, tracks to Silverton were completed and the train began transporting both freight and passengers. The laborers were paid an average of $2.25/day. The Durango-Silverton Railroad was originally constructed to haul silver and gold ore, but passengers soon started to really appreciate the view. In 2006, the Durango Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad celebrated its 125th year of continuous operation and continues to be a favorite attraction on a Colorado sightseeing vacation. Many of the buildings in historic downtown Durango were constructed with stone and brick due to a city ordinance enacted after a fire in 1889, which damaged several blocks along Main Avenue. The Diamond Belle Saloon at the Strater Hotel opened its doors in 1957 and has a bullet hole in the far east drawer behind the bar. In the recent past, there have been several well known movies made in Durango, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, City Slickers, Cliffhanger, National Lampoon’s Vacation, Night Passage, Ticket to Tomahawk, Around the World in Eighty Days, How the West Was Won, and Tracker.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">For the first time in decades, 2011-2015 promises to be an exciting time to visit Springfield! With major construction projects serving as citywide catalysts, including a $1 billion new, intercity, high-speed rail line from New Haven, (expected to be operational in 2015;) a new, $75 million intercity commuter line to Vermont, (expected to be fully functional in 2012;) the construction of Baystate Healths new, $256 million "Hospital of the Future," (expected to be fully operational in 2012;) the $75 million renovation of Springfields grand 1926 Union Station into an intermodal transportation center for trains and buses, (expected to be completed in 2013;) a new $56 million Federal Courthouse by starchitect Moshe Safdie, and a $101 million high-tech Data Center adaptively re-used from an old high school, Springfield is experiencing major economic reinvestments for the first time since the early 1970s.  With economic reinvestment, Springfield is experiencing a cultural renaissance. New festivals such as the "Hoop City Jazz Festival" (which, last year, featured Springfield blues legend Taj Mahal;) the "Springfield Vintage Grand Prix," which, in 2012, will become the Vintage Sports Car Club of Americas official race; and Springfields first-in-decades "Gay Pride Week," beginning June 8, 2011, which celebrates the citys recent influx of LGBT residents. Concurrently, renovations to Gilded Age theaters like The Paramount (formerly The Hippodrome,) The Bing Cultural Arts Center, and Springfields increasingly eclectic Club Quarter have made the city more exciting than at any time in the past half-century.  Prognosticators had long-predicted Springfields resurgence -- and now it appears that Springfielders are making it happen!  On June 1, 2011, a nearly unprecedented act of nature devastated large portions of the Springfield. That afternoon at approximately 4:45pm, the first of two tornadoes touched down within city limits. Within minutes, the tornadoes claimed four lives and caused "beyond tens of millions of dollars worth of damage," according to Massachusetts U.S. Senator John Kerry. The U.S. National Weather Service rated Springfields first of two tornadoes an E4 on the Fujita Scale (out of a possible E5.) Springfields historic Main Street, with its reputedly attractive 19th century architecture, was left in shambles - particularly the commercial district of the historically Italian South End, the historic district surrounding Mulberry Street (of Dr. Seuss fame,) Springfield College, and Springfields more suburban outer neighborhoods.  Will Springfield rebuild bigger and better than ever? WIth current new, investment in the city totaling in the $billions, the smart money is on "yes."  Located on New Englands most fertile farmland in the Connecticut River Valley, at the mid-point of Americas major Northeast trade routes between New York City, Boston, The Great Lakes, and Montreal, Canada, the City of Springfield (pop. 155,000) has been the technological and cultural center of the Connecticut River Valley since its founding in 1636. Having been burned to the ground during King Phillips War in 1675, Springfield has rebuilt before.  Nicknamed The City of Homes because of its ubiquitous Victorian architecture and The City of Firsts because of the numerous innovations that took place there during its first 375 years - including Americas first American-English dictionary (1806;) the first gasoline-powered car (1893;) the first motorcycle (1901, Indian Motorcycles;) modern fire engine and fire department (1905 1907;) commercial radio station (WBZ AM FM, 1920, located in The Kimball Towers;) and UHF television station (1951, WWLP) - Springfield is best known worldwide as the birthplace of the sport of basketball (James Naismith, 1891, located at Springfield College.) The Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Springfield beside the Connecticut River, is a major, international tourist draw.   Springfield is a highly walkable city, even by urban, New England standards - most of its major sites are in the Metro Center neighborhood; however, much of the citys attractive Victorian residential architecture is focused in its street-car suburb neighborhoods, (e.g. Forest Park Heights.)   From the early 1800s until the 1960s, Springfield was one of the United States most financially prosperous cities, as is reflected in its celebrated Victorian "homes." The Springfield Armory, the site of which George Washington and Henry Knox selected personally, made the city a center of invention, industrial innovation, and precision manufacturing from 1777 onward -- for example, Americas first musket (1794;) the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing (1819;) and the discovery of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear (1844) all took place in Springfield.  In 1968, during the Vietnam War, the Pentagon controversially closed the Springfield Armory. The United States militarys loss, however, is a Springfield visitors gain - the Springfield Armory National Park features the largest collection of historic firearms in the world.     The Armorys closing in tandem with the growth of the interstate highway system and resulting "White Flight" to the suburbs left Springfield reeling for approximately 35 years (1968-2003,) as it searched for a new identity. Springfield reached its nadir during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when it became financially insolvent. Luckily for Springfield, the citys financial woes focused regional and national attention on it, the problems needed to be fixed, and its development potential. Numerous organizations, most notably the National Urban Land Institute, studied Springfield and submitted plans for its revitalization.  Part of Springfields resurgence has been due, in part, to its increasingly complementary relationship with Hartford, Connecticut. The bi-state Knowledge Corridor Metropolitan Area has benefitted both Hartford and Springfield, which once competed over the companies and workers. Increasingly, Hartford is taking on its role as the Connecticut River Valleys financial center, with its post-modern skyline and relatively wide thoroughfares; in complement, Springfield is taking on its role as the Knowledge Corridors recreational center, with its walkable, increasingly residential Metro Center, lively Club Quarter, and Victorian architecture. In cooperating, both cities found their post-industrial identities.  Since approximately 2007, Springfield has reaped the rewards of the ULIs Plan for Springfield. Economic investment in aesthetics, particularly in the three riverfront neighborhoods, have helped to increase liveliness. As of 2010, Springfield fell to 51st in the annual U.S. "City Crime Rankings" after ranking 18th in just 2003. Increased liveliness and decreased crime will improve any citys quality of life -- and now its changing Springfields reputation.  Of course, hard work remains to make the city better than ever. Rebuilding after the devastating June 1, 2011, tonado outbreak is the citys most pressing need. Only then can Springfield start to look at other nagging problems, such as the economically and socially inhibiting placement of Interstate 91 -- a (couldnt be more) poorly-placed, elevated highway -- barring access to the Connecticut Riverfront and the Basketball Hall of Fame. Now fully aware of its short-comings thanks to the ULI plan, ambition and determined effort will be required to raise Springfield even further.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The city of Tenney was named for the owner of its townsite, lumberman John P. Tenney, because of his willingness to give land to the railroad which came through in 1885. The first house was built by his son-in-law, Fred Maechler. The post office was established in 1887, and the city was incorporated on November 30, 1901. At this time the land was surveyed and the original plat was approved. The city originally encompassed four square miles, but it never grew enough to meet its boundaries, so in 1916 the farmers petitioned their land from the city, and their request was granted. According to an unpublished town history written in the mid 1980s, the citys population peaked at about 200 in 1910. Before 1910 the city boasted a church, three grain elevators, a hardware store, two mercantile stores, a butcher shop, bank, machine shop, implement shop, blacksmith shop, pool hall, lumberyard, and a hotel, which also housed the barber shop, saloon, and post office. In 1909 a small post office building was erected and used until 1952, when Leonard Hardie became postmaster and moved the post office to the general store. Electricity arrived in Tenney in 1914, through a franchise granted to Ottertail Power Company. After 1910 a steady population decline was driven by the lack of significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. US Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 89 in 1930, 89 in 1940, 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the population was pegged at 19 by the census bureau. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which is not currently open but which (as of May 2007) is being renovated and is slated to open as a tavern/restaurant in September 2007.  The population bottomed out at 2 sometime after the 2000 census, but due to the energetic efforts of current residents, the population has again risen to six, and efforts to attract more residents are ongoing.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">"Park" in this case is a term that means a valley or meadow.  Estes Park is named after an early settler, Joel Estes, who attempted to make a living by farming.  Because of the short growing season it never really worked out.  Since the mid-1800s the main business of Estes Park has been tourism.  The clientele ranges from hard-core backcountry types to tour-buses full of drive through sightseers.  The main draw is the scenery, which is awesome.  Year-round population is approximately 6,000 people, adding the surroundings it may be 10,000.  In the peak of tourist season that probably triples.  The best time to visit for outdoor activities is July through September. Everyone else thinks so too, so it can get kind of crowded.  The heaviest traffic is probably in August.  The family/kids crowd thins out after Labor Day.  Winter is a charming time of the year as well, since it is an excellent time to go snow shoeing and cross country skiing.  Winter also provides greater opportunities to enjoy the tranquility of the Rocky Mountains as there are fewer tourists.  Winter weather is warmer than most mountain towns.  But summer is also short.  Summer temps peak in the low 90s(F) in town, much cooler as elevation increases.  If you plan on spending any time out of your car up on Trail Ridge Road take a jacket.  Estes is in a dry zone, getting maybe 13-15 inches of moisture a year.  During the summer the regular weather pattern is clear mornings with a buildup of clouds at midday and sometimes a short rain shower.  Elevation in town is 7,522 feet above sea level.  Some people experience discomforts due to altitude.</field>

Mt Hoods alpine village was established in 1849 when a mounted Calvary division was forced to abandon wagons, equipment and draft animals, because heavy snows made conditions impassable. The town was from then on referred to as "government camp" by subsequent emigrants crossing the cascades into the Willamette Valley. Now the town is a destination for recreation and out door activities, best known as the summer time hub for alpine skiing. The local ski area boasts the longest season in North America with 400+ inches of snow year on top of a glacier, lifts are open through September.</field>

		<field name="content">Wind Cave National Park gets its name from how air is exchanged between the cave system and the atmosphere.  When the outside air pressure is higher than the caverns air pressure, air is sucked into a natural fissure in the ground in attempt to equalize the pressure.  When the atmospheric pressure is lower than the air within the cave, air is blown out this same fissure. The resulting wind can be strong enough to visibly stir nearby plants.  Since low atmospheric pressure is associated with precipitation, the Wind Cave can actually be used to predict the weather. The reverse is also true--when air is going into the cave, that suggests high atmospheric pressure and fair weather.</field>

		<field name="content">The Big Bend area of Texas represents one of the last vestiges of open frontier that once encompassed the entire state. Outside of the major cities the area is largely unmolested by development; one can experience a small taste of what the unexplored state once resembled. Geography varies widely, from wide open prairie grasslands, to vast desert expanses. Far western Texas is quite mountainous; it is home to Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas. The flatlands of the Permian Basin remain a center for petroleum production for the US. The wildlife is also representative of an outsiders expectation; during the daytime hours it is not unusual to see a roadrunner or armadillo wandering alongside the road, and at night the far away wail of a coyote  is commonplace.  Far western Texas is, in contrast to the eastern portion, is quite sparsely populated. For example, Loving County, which is on the New Mexico state line, is the least populous county in the United States, claiming a mere 56 residents. Brewster County, in the Big Bend, is larger in land area than the state of Rhode Island yet is home to only slightly more than 6,000 residents; over 4,000 of which live in the county seat of Alpine. Keep in mind when vacationing in the area that towns and cities are often a hundred or so miles apart, so embarking on a drive in the open Big Bend country without a full tank of gas and necessary provisions is not advised.</field>

		<field name="content">El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe (literally, The Town of Saint Joseph of Guadalupe) was founded by José Joaquín Moraga in 1777 near the present day intersection of Guadalupe Parkway and West Taylor Street.  In 1797, the pueblo was moved to the Plaza Pueblo (now Plaza de César Chávez), around which San José grew.  And the rest is, as they say, history.  True to its location in the heart of Silicon Valley, San José is now home to the headquarters of many "tech" companies such as Cisco Systems, eBay, and Adobe Systems, just to name a few.  There are so many different neighborhoods in the large geographic area of San José that, depending on where you are, you might not know if youre still in the same city.  Like most Bay Area towns and cities, San José is an expensive place to live (many basic houses easily top $1M in price). Some of the hip areas to live these days are in San Joses downtown area, for those who prefer urban living, or Santana Row for a mixed living, shopping and dining community. You can find vintage California charm in the neighborhoods of Willow Glen and Rose Garden. The woodsy area of Almaden Valley is known for its excellent schools, and Silver Creek is known for its subdivisions of sprawling "McMansions." Evergreen is in East San Jose, right at the foothills of the city. Evergreen has some more affordable housing and is very residential. Since it is at the foothills, east San Jose is not as accessible as the other neighborhoods. Evergreen has excellent views of the foothills and many parks and recreational areas. Groseprick Park is located right in the heart of Evergreen and offers a mile long loop, basketball courts, baseball fields, playgrounds, and hiking trails.</field>

		<field name="content">The area of "Central City" centered around Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard (historically known as Dryades Street) was a center of African-American commerce and culture in the first half of the 20th century. The end of racial segregation ironically hurt the neighborhood, as much of the African-American business as well as people went to other parts of the city. The area perhaps hit bottom in the 1980s, then the first projects to revitalize the historic neighborhood began.   Another blow came in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina.  As the city repopulated afterwards, Central City became notorious for shockingly high rates of violent crime, as rival gangs and drug dealers exchanged gunfire in the streets.  Although crime has gone down from mid-2009 to early-2012, Central City is still a dangerous neighborhood, not recommended for casual visitors.  Projects to revive the historic O.C. Haley business strip are starting to show fruit, though it still has a long way to go. Those who decide to visit should be particularly aware of their surroundings and inquire about conditions in advance.</field>

Philipse switched allegiance to England when the British evicted the Dutch, but his heirs were less astute in their political affiliations: 3rd generation Philipses continued allegiance to England during the American Revolution and were forced to forfeit their vast land holdings. After the war, the small hamlet around the Philipses mill was renamed Beekmantown after a prominent patriot family. By 1874 the hamlet had grown into a village and incorporated as North Tarrytown. In 1996 residents of the village voted to change its name from North Tarrytown to Sleepy Hollow to distinguish it from the adjacent village of  Tarrytown . Sleepy Hollow shares a zip code and a school system with Tarrytown, but the two villages are separate municipalities. Sleepy Hollow Chamber of Commerce provides tourist information and descriptions of seasonal events on its web site and in its storefront window: 1 Neperan Rd, Tarrytown, +1 914 631-1705,   .  Washington Irvings short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is set here and in Tarrytown. In the story, "Sleepy Hollow" is the valley of the Pocantico River, now largely occupied by Sleepy Hollow Cemetery and Rockefeller State Park Preserve.</field>

		<field name="content">Indianapolis downtown is cut through by the non-navigable waters of the White River  The name Indianapolis is simply Indiana joined with polis, the Greek word for city. The founders of Indianapolis expected it to be the "Great Inland Port," but they neglected to consider the fact that the White River is impossible to navigate most of the year; other than during the spring, it is a melange of sandbars and temporary islands.  However, this port-desire left the city with a beautiful canal district, though the canal itself is used only for recreational paddleboats and kayaks.  Instead, Indianapolis is called the "Crossroads of America" due to its centrality in Americas Interstate Highway System. The city is warm in the summer, with average highs in the mid-80s in June, July, and August.  Indianapolis has a typical mid-western winter.  January is the coldest month, with an average high of 34°F (1.1°C). Every few years, the winter gets sharp with significant snowfall and once a generation or so there is an ice storm or otherwise impassible winter weather event. Indianapolis exists within a tornado region but has never been impacted by major cyclones. Travelers really only need to beware the occasional nasty winter.</field>

These cities all lie in San Bernardino or Riverside counties. The Palm Springs area, which also lies in Riverside County in "the high desert", is farther east and is considered part of Coachella Valley. The High Desert is generally not considered part of the I.E.   Citrus groves used to dominate the landscape of the IE.  Native Americans called the Inland Empire home for thousands of years before the arrival of European explorers in the 18th century. Residents would spend winters in the warmer valleys and move into the cooler mountains during summer months.   Throughout much of the 19th and 20th century, agriculture was the dominant industry for the region. The post-World War II decades saw an explosion of residents and industry as developers turned to cheap land east of Los Angeles. Although the area is often criticized for its sprawling developments that are incredibly automobile-dependent, in recent years many cities have made an effort to encourage denser housing developments centered around commercial and office-park developments. Today, the regions growth continues as housing prices remain incredibly affordable and residents from Orange and Los Angeles counties swell the areas population.</field>

The towns name supposedly comes from a group of gold seekers who, in 1900, trekked up the Koyukuk River and got "cold feet"-returning south from Slate Creek, the original name of this settlement, rather than spending the winter here. The town was larger then, consisting of a gambling hall, 7 saloons, and two roadhouses. It was abandoned in 1912 in favor of Wiseman. In 1970, a camp was built here to host construction workers for the Trans-Alaska pipeline.   This settlement is really the only true truck stop along the highway, and "the worlds northernmost truck stop". It is extremely important for persons continuing north on the Dalton Highway, as there are no services until Deadhorse...240 miles away.</field>

Eisner, May 1, 1989   Walt Disney World s third theme park opened in May 1989 as Disney–MGM Studios, joining the  Magic Kingdom  and  EPCOT . The park, billed as "the Hollywood that never was", features live shows and attractions based on movie and television favorites, from classic Golden Age films to modern-day blockbusters.  In addition to the well-known Disney-branded productions, several Disney subsidiaries also have inspired rides and shows here; its the place to go for fans of Lucasfilm properties, Pixar films, ABC television, and Jim Hensons Muppets.  Among the top attractions are two exceptional thrill rides, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (a 13-story vertical drop) and the Rock n Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith (a launched coaster, 0-60 in 2.8 seconds).  The latest additions to the park are highly interactive: a live American Idol singing competition and a ride through a Toy Story-themed shooting gallery.  Just south of Hollywood Studios is the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex, the spring training home of the Atlanta Braves and host to countless other sporting events throughout the year.</field>

The small community (population 450) is located at the mouth of the Salmon River, on the north shore of Icy Strait just 50 miles northwest of Juneau.  Incorporated in 2004, the city of Gustavus has a mayor and city council. Many residents are self employed in tourism and service/retail businesses, as well as fishing, power generation and aviation. Glacier Bay National Park employs over half of the residents of Gustavus. Others work for the state or for the Chatham School District.   In the past early settlers called the town Strawberry Point. The U.S. Postal Service renamed the town in 1925. The first successful homestead patent was issued in 1923, although settlers were present here as early as 1917.  Historically, the area was used by the Tlingit people for seasonal harvesting and smoking of salmon.   The town encompasses 29.2 square miles of land and 10 square miles of water.  The areas maritime climate is characterized by cool summers and mild winters. Summer temperatures range from 52 to 63 degrees; winter temperatures range from 26 to 39.    The geology of the area was influenced by glaciers and ocean.  As the glaciers that covered the area 200 years ago have receded, the land in Gustavus has risen quickly – over an inch each year. Land that once was within the tidal zone is now high and dry. Where grasses once predominated, spruce trees now tower.</field>

		<field name="content">Geneva sits on the shores of Seneca Lake.   The Finger Lakes formed after the last Ice Age.  Previous glacial retreats had carved out deep valleys across the middle of the state, and rivers flowed southward through them into the Susquehanna watershed, which empties into Chesapeake Bay.  But the last Ice Age left a terminal moraine near the southern ends of the valleys, cutting them off from the Susquehanna system.  Another moraine farther north acted as a dam and restricted northerly outflow as well, so the valleys filled with water and became the Finger Lakes.  As with most of Upstate New York, the Finger Lakes region is rooted in American Indian heritage. The Sullivan-Clinton Campaign, a major 1779 American military expedition against the Iroquois, took place throughout the region, as detailed on many historical markers in the area.  The Lakes themselves vary from tiny Canadicemdash;a little over 3 miles (5 km) long and less than half a mile (1 km) widemdash; all the way to the massive Cayuga Lakemdash;40 miles (64 km) from north to south and wider than Canadice is long.

The land was originally owned by the Carroll family and named after Balamona after the Carroll holding in Ireland.    Nickys Diner   At the cross section there were three roads that cut through the farmland, a there a small business section was created.  The north/south being Brookeville Pike, now Rt. 97 Georgia Ave, ran from Washington D.C. to Baltimore.   Veirs Mill Rd. was used a coach road with sections of plank road, which ran from Wheaton to Rockville.  Lastly, the third road was Old Bladensburg Rd., now University Blvd, that connected Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and Bladensburg.   Before 1947 only 29,000 people were living in Wheaton on farms and large estates, however in 1950 and 1960 the number of residents increased tremendously, which led to the widening of Georgia Ave, also known as the “Avenue of Progess”.  Since then there has been a tremendous amount of businesses that have blossomed such as the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in 1959, and Wheaton Regional Park in 1958.   However because Wheaton is so close to the large Silver Spring area many residents were unhappy because of their loss of identity, therefore in 1965 the community residents of Wheaton and Kensington gained permission to use Wheaton, MD for specific zip codes such as 20902 and many others.  The area has developed extremely since its humble beginnings and is now known as a central business area with a diverse community surrounded by major roads and transit systems.</field>

		<field name="content">Though the town shares its name with the capital of Peru, it is pronounced Lye-mah thanks to the local vernacular. Founded in the 1830s, Lima became an oil boom town in the late 1800s. The city flourished as an industrial town until the 1970s, when many industries began to leave as part of the Rust Belt decline that affected much of the Midwest. This is evidenced by the sheer number of abandoned factories and warehouses in the city. Yet, Lima remains prominent in the area as a hub for business and local culture.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown Minneapolis from across the Mississippi River  Minneapolis was destined to be a center of commerce due to its location at the Falls of St. Anthony, which was named by the French explorer Fr. Louis Hennepin in 1680.  St. Anthony Falls is by far the largest source of water power on the Mississippi River.  The falls were harnessed to power lumber mills in the 1840s and later for flour milling.  By 1870, Minneapolis on the west bank and St. Anthony on the east bank formed the largest flour producing center in the world.  In 1872, Minneapolis absorbed its older neighbor.  Most of the old St Anthony township is now known as Northeast Minneapolis.    A small part of the old township comprises most of the current suburb of St. Anthony.   The name "Minneapolis", meaning "The City of Lakes" in a mash-up of the Dakota word minne and the Ancient Greek word polis, refers to the citys 22 natural lakes. The local jewels are the "Chain of Lakes": Cedar, Isles, Calhoun, Harriet, Nokomis, each 3-4 miles around. The citys excellent parks department maintains walking and biking paths around the lakes, offering residents a place to exercise or stroll. The Lake Harriet Bandshell is a popular summertime event host often featuring the renowned Minnesota Orchestra. Dont miss a ride on the restored trolley between Lakes Calhoun and Harriet operated by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum.  The city has done an excellent job fostering developed neighborhoods, each with a distinctive feel. Downtown is the visual anchor featuring the high-rise suites, sporting events (Timberwolves, Vikings, and Twins all play downtown), and nightclub scene. Northeast is the oldest part of the city, showing off its working-class and immigrant roots in great ethnic food, neighborhood bars, and social clubs, and more recently home to an arts and riverfront redevelopment movement. Uptown historically has been one of the citys youth centers featuring funky food, drink, theater, and plenty of tattoos and mohawks, but is orienting more towards yuppies and young families as real estate anywhere near the lakes becomes an ever more prized commodity. Uptown and the Lakes area dissolves into quiet, tucked-away Linden Hills (a one-time bedroom community) to the south and Lyn-Lake, home to many indie stages, music-oriented cafes and boozers, and alternative lifestyles and hangouts of all sorts, to the east. The University of Minnesotas main campus straddles the Mississippi River in the southeast surrounded by the usual college campus environs.</field>

According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2005, the county has a total area of 45 square miles, which 25 square miles is land, and 20 square miles is water.  Bristol County is located on the Narragansett Bay, directly between Providence and Newport allowing access to both the city and the beaches. Due to its location, Bristol County experiences all four seasons, with a long summer, scenic autumn and spring, and snowy winters. In the summer many residence go to the Newport, or the Cape, and during the winter, ski trips to Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire are only a few hours north.</field>

		<field name="content">:"Welcome to a kingdom of animals, real, ancient and imagined: a kingdom ruled by lions, dinosaurs and dragons; a kingdom of balance, harmony and survival; a kingdom we enter to share in the wonder, gaze at the beauty, thrill at the drama, and learn." mdash; Michael D. Eisner, April 22, 1998   Walt Disney World s fourth and newest theme park opened in April 1998, joining the  Magic Kingdom ,  Epcot , and  Disney-MGM Studios .  When it first opened, park advertising used the faux-African word "nahtazu" ("not a zoo") as a slogan to emphasize that it was not just a collection of animals in small iron cages.  The animals here spend their days in expansive habitats that are as close to their natural environments as possible, with subtle and camouflaged barriers keeping them away from guests (and each other).  At night, they sleep comfortably indoors in the parks extensive housing area backstage.  Although the animals are nominally the main attraction, they may finally have been overshadowed by the parks newest thrill ride, Expedition Everest.  Towering 200 feet over the surrounding terrain, this mini-mountain is visible from some distance away and even threatens to overtake the Tree of Life as the parks most visible icon.  The Tree, perhaps by contrast, is most impressive up close, where its size and detail can truly be appreciated.    The other major rides and attractions include Its Tough to be a Bug, a 3-D movie based on the Pixar film A Bugs Life; Kilimanjaro Safaris, a jeep ride through the recreated African savanna; Kali River Rapids, a soaking raft ride; and Dinosaur, a time travel ride into the late Cretaceous.  For the youngest visitors, Camp Minnie-Mickey is a special space where they can meet their favorite characters.  Not far from Animal Kingdom is Blizzard Beach, a large water park themed as a melting ski resort.</field>

Self magazine proclaims Asheville as America’s "Happiest City." PETA lists Asheville as "Americas Best Vegetarian-Friendly Small City." Author Lee Pantas, in his guidebook The Ultimate Guide To Asheville The Western North Carolina Mountains says it all in describing Asheville "as a city not easily forgotten once visited".

As such, its the states center of government and higher education and is a regional transportation center.  Even with a population of 240,000, it retains a friendly, "small town" feel.  There are several threads running through Lincolns cultural composition.  The university and state government have attracted many rural Nebraskans to the city over the years, reinforcing its small town feel.  Its position as a college town also helps shape the citys political culture, which is somewhat more liberal than most of the rest of the state.  Once a very ethnically homogeneous city, it has become more diverse over the past 30 years, welcoming immigrants and refugees from various parts of the globe.  There is a long-standing friendly rivalry with  Omaha , 57 mi (92 km) to the northeast.  Indoor worksites are smoke-free in Lincoln, so youll be able to enjoy smoke-free restaurants and bars.</field>

Southern Oregon University     balances the tourist population with students throughout the year. The weather is relatively mild, with a few days of snow in the winter, several days of 100F weather in the summer. Some believe that the town resembles northern Italy or Switzerland, with snow covered peaks in the winter, a lake not too far away in the valley, and a nice, small-town, community feel that is oh-so-rare these days in the States.  There are two main business districts: one downtown, centered on the Plaza and running southwest along Main Street toward the library. This old-fashioned boutique shopping area is home to many amazing restaurants.  In fact, youll have a hard time finding a bad meal. Connected to this area is 93-acre Lithia Park    which was designed in part by John McLaren (also the designer of San Franciscos Golden Gate Park) in 1914. The other business district is around two miles to the southwest along Siskiyou Boulevard where it meets Ashland Street/Highway 66, near the Southern Oregon University campus and the Ashland Shopping Center. Ashland has a limited number of drive-through permits, and thus fast food joints. Wendys, Taco Bell, Subway and other chains are still open in Ashland.  Outside of the business districts, Ashland offers a host of outdoor attractions.  The famous Pacific Crest Trail   , Crater Lake, rafting, biking and Mount Ashland    ski slope are all nearby.  Many public places, including most hotels and BBs, coffeehouses and even pubs offer free wireless Internet access.</field>

Its most well-known landmark is the Alamo, the site of the famous battle (1836) where Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie were killed. Though it must be said that when most visitors see the Alamo for the first time, their common reaction is "Hm, I thought it would be bigger."  No other city in Texas reflects the states Spanish and Mexican heritage better than San Antonio.  Hispanics make up a considerable fraction of the population though and it shows in most places. The Hispanic atmosphere of San Antonio makes it a truly unique U.S. city. This becomes most evident during Fiesta week, a yearly celebration that attracts 3.5 million people to its 110 plus events from all over to enjoy parades, music, festivals, fairs and food and drink in the charming downtown streets of the city.  San Antonio, with a population of around 1.4 million, and a metro population of nearly 2.2 million, still enjoys a small-town feel despite the hustle and bustle. Its people are friendly, open and bicultural, and the concentration of population around its center makes it easy to get just about anywhere within a 30-40 minute drive.</field>

		<field name="content">Main Street in Park City  Long before Park City became a world class mountain resort and venue for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, it was famous as a silver mining town, and boasts a lively and colorful past.  Founded by prospectors in the late 1860s, Park City continued to mine silver until the early 1970s.   From approximately 1850, when small settlements were forming, until the railroad lines were laid throughout the West in the 1890s, stagecoach travel was the main form of transportation. There was even a stagecoach business in Park City! William Kimball, a Park City resident, started his stagecoach business in 1858 competing with Brigham Young for United States mail contracts. He was sent to England on a Mormon Church mission and when he returned, he started the Park City-Salt Lake City Route. The Kimball Brothers Stage Line operated from 1872 until 1890, when the railroad made its way into the West. Moving quicker as well as transporting more people and mail, the railroad easily put the stagecoach out of business.  Between 1880 and 1920 when Park City mines were the most organized, productive and active, they produced more than 20 million tons of ore including lead, zinc, copper, silver, and a small amount of gold. These were the years of Park Citys mining renaissance. The mining company, Park City Consolidated Mines, started the ski business in 1963, when they built the first lifts on what was then called Treasure Mountain.  The Park City area now has three world class resorts: Park City Mountain Resort   , Deer Valley Resort   , and the Canyons Resort   .    In 2002 Park City was a major host site for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.  175 city volunteers contributed more than 6000 hours to the Games, or the equivalent of 750 workdays (and this doesnt even count the public safety volunteers).  Tourist Information  Park Citys visitor information centers offer maps, brochures and other information.

South Lake Tahoe, the largest town around the lake, is situated on the south shore and offers beautiful views of mountains covered with fir and pine trees, deep blue water year-round, and a wealth of outdoor activities. A popular location for skiers and snowboarders during the snowy winter season, Lake Tahoe is also home to miles of beaches for sun-tanning, boating, water skiing, and swimming in the summer. Both the north and south shores offer plenty of hiking and biking trails and retreats for campers. On the Nevada side of the town (Stateline, NV), is a long stretch of more than ten casinos--a haven for those looking for a world-class gambling experience.  Originally a town of several smaller communities, South Lake Tahoe has developed into one large area consisting of approximately 21,000 permanent residents. The population fluctuates massively in the winter, and triples around New Years, as there is a massive influx of tourists visiting for the holiday season. There are two main parts of South Lake Tahoe: the Western part of town, centered around "The Y" - the X-shaped intersection of US Highway 50 and California state highway 89, and the Eastern part, centered around the CA-NV state border. The former is distinctly residential, and the latter is distinctly commercial - it is the home of all the casinos and larger hotels, and Heavenlys Gondola starts in this area.  Traveling from "The Y" toward Stateline, motels, hotels, resorts, and small businesses line Highway 50, before arriving at Heavenly Village a town center created at the foot of the Heavenly ski resorts Gondola. Heavenly Village is comprised of shops, restaurants and two Marriott resort hotels. There is also a multi-story parking garage at Heavenly Village. Heavenly Village is the center of activity for the majority of visitors to the South Lake Tahoe region, and is bustling with activity year-round.  One block northeast of Heavenly Village is the official California-Nevada state line, and the unincorporated settlement of Stateline, Nevada, which is home to four major resort casinos, and two smaller local casinos.</field>

		<field name="content">Barrington, RI was first established as it’s own town back in 1717 and is named after Barrington, Somerset where many of the original English settlers came from. Barrington is not a very large town as it spans only 15.4 square miles. However, of the 15.4 square miles, 8.4 of it is land and 7.0 of it is water. Barrington’s population as of 2000 is 16,819 people, which makes for 1,998.1 people per square mile. Much of Barrington’s history comes from the brick industry and small businesses, which helps it maintain it’s friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  Barrington’s crime rate is only .01% and it’s property crime rate is 1.35%. In fact, Barrington was ranked 6th best place to live in America according to a 2005 CNN Money article. This article ranked the top 100 cities and towns based on median income, fastest job growth, safety, and least polluted.  http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2005/top100/top100_1.html   Barrington is located on Narragansett Bay, directly between Providence and Newport, allowing it easy access to both the city and the beaches.  Due to its close proximity, quiet reputation, and excellent public school system, Barrington is considered an excellent place to raise a family.  Many residents enjoy the numerous job opportunites in nearby Providence and Boston.  It is praised as being a beautiful place to live, characterized by green grass and trees and punctuated with its beaches and rivers.  Due to its coastal New England climate, Barrington experiences all four seasons, with a long summer, blooming spring, scenic autumn, and snowy winter.  In the summer, it offers quick getaways to the beaches in Newport, the Cape, and the Islands, and in the winter, ski trips to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont are just a few hours north.  Barrington offers the best parts of New England living, while offering a quiet haven with easy access to the nearby action.  “Bordered on three sides by water, this small town on Narragansett Bay retains the leisurely feel of its days as an early 20th-century summer resort. Shops are clustered along County Road, the main street that runs through Barrington, but the commercial hub is small.”</field>

Add a sizeable cohort of the artistically and literarily inclined with a certain tinge of New Age beliefs, and you definitely have a town with people watching possibilities while shopping the local galleries and craft shops.  Many of these boutiques are not easily seen by the passing traveler. One has to stop and look about to wring the greatest satisfaction from the Willits experience.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Byron has a long and glorious history stretching way back to around the 1890s, when the tiny railway post was still called Bear Creek (pronounced "crick").  It got this name because a farmer thought he saw a bear once down in a little creek that flows through the outskirts of town.  Resident Byronians keep this fascinating tradition alive by painting everything school-related with sweeping murals of majestic black bears and erecting awe-inspiring sculptures to the beast.  Tourists should be open-minded, however; this is by no means considered by locals to be idol worship or to weaken their steadfast following of the Christian faith.</field>

They provide world-class fly-fishing, whitewater rafting, and now kayaking.  Originally named Defiance, in the late 1800s, the name was changed by white men arrived from an  Iowa  town called  Glenwood .  Many of the nearby towns (Aspen and Leadville) had their booms while Glenwood Springs was yet in its infancy.  Glenwood Springs was difficult to reach due to the canyons to the east and west; it was also located on Ute land. The town grew in part thanks to its location on the railroad and the Colorado River.  The local area is surrounded by public lands, especially the White River National Forest, which attracts hunters and campers from great distance. The Grand Mesa is to the west and the Flattops Wilderness area dominate to the North.  The  Flattops is a very large area offering unlimited high-country exploring.  The Four Mile recreation area (to the South-west)offers easier day mountain access favored by locals. Glenwood Springs is a truly great place to access all the Rocky Mountains have to offer.  In terms of Culture (and ski-appeal) it is hard to overestimate the role of Aspen.  Glenwood Springians may not want to actually live in Aspen, but they do appreciate being able to commute to a cultural mecca.    Up the valley is  Carbondale ,  Basalt ,  Snowmass  and  Aspen .  To the west is  New Castle ,  Silt  and  Rifle .</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">the Strip at daytime  Compared with other cities in the western US, Las Vegas is a relatively recent arrival. It was founded in 1905, and for many years it was merely a small settlement in the middle of the desert. However, several pivotal events would come together in less than twenty years that would help Las Vegas grow into what it is today:  The construction of  Hoover Dam  in 1928 brought thousands of workers to the area. What is now known as Boulder City was established for the workers.  Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, and downtown Las Vegas became an entertainment center for the dam workers, with casinos and speakeasies. Business became so good that it surpassed Reno as the gambling capital of the world in less than 10 years.  In 1941, the luxurious El Rancho Vegas resort opened on what would later become the Las Vegas Strip.  Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel later opened the Flamingo Hotel in 1946, starting the building boom and one-upmanship that would still continue today and creating a precedent of organized crime involvement in Nevadas gambling industry. By the 1990s, federal regulations and enforcement, and investments by established corporations would virtually wipe out any mob involvement.    The city is laid out as follows: Main Street as well as the numbered streets run north-south, starting with Main Street in the west. The bus station is on Main Street. Downtown has several hotel-casinos, as well as the "Fremont Street Experience", a pedestrian mall lined with casinos, near the western end of Fremont Street. A couple miles south of downtown starts the "Strip" (Las Vegas Boulevard South), a north-south street lined with large casino-hotels, shopping malls, and other attractions. The northern end of the Strip is marked by the tall Stratosphere tower. Frequent city buses run up and down the Strip and connect the Strip to downtown. The Las Vegas monorail and the convention center sit just east of the Strip, and the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) is located slightly more east of the Strip on Maryland Parkway. The airport is at the southern end of the Strip.</field>

At one point the area belonged to Harligen( another town in Montgomery Township) yet was later separated into its own identity in 1875. The area was originally named Vanaken after the New York contractor who bought most of the farms in the area, split them up into roads,and tried to start a town. The town once revolved around a train station which closed in the 1940s, the structure still stands near Township Line Road and Route 206.   Today Belle Mead    is a widespread community  mostly consisting of residential areas, farmlands, parks, and shopping centers all sharing the zip code 08502. The area is still considered a farming region, with many of these farms being protected/preserved by Montgomery and Hillsborough Townships, however building and residential areas have been on the rise since the late 1990s. Despite the rise in building, Belle Mead still remains a small town with a cozy and inviting atmosphere</field>

Like its sister towns, Perdido Key boasts sugar white sands and crystal water. Although boutiques and quaint eateries dot the landscape in Perdido Key, the area feels somewhat removed, enjoying a slower pace. Boating and fishing are naturals in this relaxed community.  The unspoiled, white sands of Perdido Key enjoy a history rich in lore. Rumor has it that pirates buried treasure along the precarious shoals of Perdido Bay where it enters the Gulf. Today, people still wander the beach hoping to uncover the lost treasures. Because of its unique geography the Key is one of the most natural and beautiful areas along the Gulf Coast. Here, the waves invite laughter and surfing, diving and sport fishing. The back bays and lagoons are ideal for boating or waterskiing. No doubt you’ll believe Floridas Perdido Key brims with treasure, whether or not you find anything buried.</field>

		<field name="content">When the organization of Madison County took place on March 1, 1810, there was no city or village suitable to be selected as a county seat. The General Assembly appointed a commission to choose a site for the seat of justice. They choose a 200 acre tract of land in Union Township belonging to a John Murfin. Lots were laid for a new town which the commissioners called London.  For the past 190 years London has served as the community hub for Madison County and continues to grow in a planned and directed manner. The 2000 U.S. census has the official population of London at 8, 771. The population for Madison County exceeds 40,000.  As people become more willing to commute long distances in exchange for a more rural lifestyle, London has grown considerably. Since 1980, the land size of London has increased over 70%.  Londons rich heritage and sense of history are evident in the newly completed Downtown Restoration/Revitalization Project. Citizens, community leaders and consultants are working together to guide the development of new residential areas and expanded community services, while maintaining Londons distinctive character.</field>

		<field name="content">Rosslyns skyline, viewed from D.C.   Arlington is part of the original "ten miles square" which the U.S. Constitution dedicated as the  District of Columbia , the nations capital. It was one of the Districts original two counties; Arlington County (named Alexandra County till 1920) was the part on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, and Washington County (present day Washington, D.C.) was the part on the Maryland side. The law creating the District prohibited building government buildings in Arlington County, leaving it to be used for gambling and other vices.  In the 1840s, as a result of issues relating to congressional representation, slavery, and the economy, the U.S. Congress returned Arlington County to  Virginia . Most travelers to Arlington will visit both  Washington, D.C.  and Arlington, and the two cities are seamlessly linked together by the Metrorail system.  Arlington has maintained a healthy balance of urban and suburban life through its self-proclaimed "Arlington Way" of policy making. A large percentage of residents are involved in grassroots political and urban planning processes. Whatever your purpose in coming to Arlington, youll find the area a friendly and convenient place to visit and explore.</field>

		<field name="content">In June of 1849, five men from Vermont started out on their voyage west.  They had heard about the Indian lands in which the Government obtained in the 1848 treaty. Before arriving, they had heard of a place called "The Falls" - as Waupaca is divided by the beautiful, rocky Waupaca/Tomorrow River.  Upon arriving in what is now Waupaca, they became the first men to penetrate that far into the wilderness of Wisconsin. Waupaca is a quaint town of just over 6,000 people, located between the Crystal River and Tomorrow River, both of which feed off the Chain O Lakes.  In summer months, the town and outlying areas are a huge tourist attraction, bringing visitors and seasonal cottage owners. The Chain O Lakes is a group of 22 lakes, all connected by small channels which can be traveled through by boat. Between May and September, the lakes are a fun way to enjoy waterskiing, wakeboarding, wave-runners, or just a relaxing day sitting on the sandy beaches, which many of the 22 lakes have to offer. The afforadable "Lake Life" is what brings so many visitors and seasonal residents from cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.  In winter months, it is a key destination for snowmobiling and cross country skiing.</field>

South Carolina is very hot in the summer, and its nice coastal areas are a big tourist attraction.

		<field name="content">In 1817 Fort Smith was established as a military fort next to Indian territory in Oklahoma to keep the peace between the native Osage tribes and the recently relocated Cherokee groups. It is located at the junction of the Arkansas river and the  Poteau  river at a place that early French explorers called Belle Point. The military fort was named after General Thomas A. Smith, the militarys district commander. The military later relocated to nearby Fort Chaffee but the civilian settlers remained keeping the name of the fort and establishing a western frontier town that was often the last genteel layover for people from all walks of life before excursions into Indian Oklahoma including soldiers en route to the Mexican War in the Southwest.   Later Fort Smith became a popular stop for westward expansionists, gold rush diggers, and those seeking better opportunities due to the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 20th century. Today as the second largest city in the state, the municipality and surrounding area is a major economic hub for the state of Arkansas with many major corporations with roots in the city still in operation and employing thousands. The downtown area and commercial zones are usually busy with voluminous traffic most days but beyond that one will find quiet residential zones and woods. Recently due to economic trends in the U.S. economy, some major factories and plants have closed and/or moved resulting in a swelling of the unemployed population and an uptick in local taxes.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Central Coast includes some of the classic tourist country of California – particularly the scenic version of the drive (or train ride) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The Spanish colonialists traveled along the Central Coast – roughly on the route of Highway 1 – and created missions at Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Carmel, Soledad, Jolon, San Miguel, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and San Buenaventura (Ventura). Depending on what you count as Central Coast, the area has about half of the states missions.   Much of the Central Coast is agricultural, with an emphasis on crops that flourish in relatively cool, coastal climates – such as artichokes and strawberries. In recent years, land has increasingly been converted to grape growing, especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties. The Santa Barbara County wine country was made famous in the movie Sideways. Monterey County is a renowned wine region, with more than 40,000 acres planted in premium wine grapes. Fishing was once an important part of the regional economy, but has receded greatly. There is oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, but activity is greatly below previous levels.   Tourism is a critical industry, particularly on the Monterey Peninsula and around Santa Barbara. The temperate Central Coast has also been known as a retirement area, particularly for people from Los Angeles.  Population in the Central Coast is concentrated in a series of small-medium sized cities, only two of which exceed 100,000. The cities include Monterey, fast growing Salinas (a few miles inland), Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz city and county are sometimes considered part of the Central Coast, but they have become increasingly tied to Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), to which many Santa Cruzans commute. Ventura County, at the southern end of the Central Coast, is classified by the Census Bureau as part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and commuter train service to LA is available.  The Central Coast has a large number of colleges, considering its relatively small population (about 2 million of Californias 37 million). There are University of California branches at Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, each of which strongly shapes the character of its city. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is the mainstay for the city of San Luis Obispo. There are newer state colleges at Ventura and at Fort Ord, a converted military base in Monterey County.</field>

		<field name="content">The Erie Region of Pennsylvania, characterized by its connection to the Great Lakes, stands in contrast to downstate Pennsylvania. The region specialized in ship-building, shipping, and industry more closely related to the  Great Lakes  cities of  Buffalo  and  Rochester , rather than the oil refineries in cities like  Philadelphia  and the steel industry of  Pittsburgh . The region has close ties to Great Lakes sports teams, including the  Buffalo  Bills and  Detroit  Red Wings. Northwestern Pennsylvania is much like Western New York, in that it is entirely different from the eastern, more coastal half of the state. It is also much colder and snowier with lake-effect snow falling almost every day during the Winter months.  Lake-effect snows occur quite often in the winter months; however, they are more of a threat when the wind comes from the northwest, usually after a low pressure system passes through the area.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Ohio is the 35th largest state by size, but 7th by population (11,459,011 residents in 2004 according to the US Census Bureau). Ohios nickname is "The Heart of It All", purportedly because of its shape (kind of like a heart), its central location to the densely populated areas of the US, its mosaic of big commercial cities, small towns, industry and farmland, and its critical role in "Americas Heartland" (which can refer to the Midwest agricultural sector and the Great Lakes industrial base).   Ohio has always played and continues to play a critical role in the development of the  United States  history and government. One of Ohios contributions to history was the  Underground Railroad  network which helped escaped slaves move to the free northern states and Canada. Many Ohioans, most notably Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe and John Brown campaigned against slavery.   Ohio has also been home to eight American Presidents, giving it the nickname Mother of US Presidents. American Presidents from Ohio were Ulysses Grant (18th, born in  Point Pleasant ), Rutherford Hayes (19th, Delaware), James Garfield (20th, Orange),  Benjamin Harrison (23rd,  North Bend ), William McKinley (25th, Niles), William Taft (27th,  Cincinnati ), and Warren Harding (29th, Corsica/Blooming Grove). William Henry Harrison (9th), born in Virginia but settled (and buried) in  North Bend .   Ohio is considered one of the most important states in Presidential elections due to its 20 electoral votes and is often one of the few states that can go to either party. Unlike  California ,  Illinois ,  New York  that lean Democratic and  Texas  which almost always votes Republican, Ohios voting tendencies changes from election to election.  The Wright Brothers,  Orville and Wilbur, inventors of the airplane, were from  Dayton  in Ohio, giving the state one reason to call itself the Birthplace of Aviation (though the brothers actually flew the airplane first in  Kitty Hawk ,  North Carolina , Dayton was their home and the place were they conducted their research, development, and fabrication activities, as well as test-flights of various glider prototypes). Ohio, however,  has additional claims to the nickname. Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk the moon, is an Ohioan, as is former U.S. Senator and astronaut John Glenn, who was the first the American to complete an orbit of the Earth from outer space. Ohio has also been home to 23 other astronauts and is home to the Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, and National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton.  Inventor Thomas A. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio. His birthplace and home have been preserved.</field>

		<field name="title">Takoma Park</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">A train station was located here on the BO railroad in the 1880s, around which the Victorian community of Takoma Park and neighboring Takoma, D.C. developed, at a time when much of D.C. was still farmland.  Takoma Park quickly became the central commercial area for farmers, commuters and gentry commuting into Washington, D.C. by train and streetcar.  Now it is a vibrant satellite city with a "small town" ambiance and a reputation for post-1960s era counterculture political activism.  Takoma Park is sometimes known as the "Berkeley of the East", although it is much smaller than  Berkeley (California) .  Takoma Parks legendary socialist mayor, Sammy Abdul Abbott, was widely known in the 1960s for fighting successfully (alongside future DC Mayor Marion Barry and other members of SNCC) to prevent Takoma Park and central D.C. from being torn apart by a 10-lane freeway, which was projected to bisect Dupont Circle and at one point, the Lincoln Memorial.  His slogan was "No white mens roads through black mens homes."  As a result, there are no continuous freeways running through D.C. today.  Ironically, Sam Abbott was white, and the son of a banker who had disowned him when he became a card-carrying Communist in the 1930s; most of the residents of Takoma Park at the time were elderly white civil servants and Seventh-Day Adventists, and as a result of the numerous decaying Victorian buildings, the area was flippantly known as "Tacky Park" or "Glaucoma Park".  Hippies fleeing Adams Morgan were attracted to Takoma Park in the 1970s by its reputation as a health-conscious, Victorian Village populated by eccentric artists such as John Fahey, the founder of Takoma Records.  Founded by B.F. Gilbert in 1887, the hilly town became a haven for Seventh-Day Adventists, who moved their World Headquarters here from  Battle Creek, Michigan  (home of the Matthew Broderick cereal drama Road to Wellville).  At the turn of the century, they built several downtown churches, a small Christian liberal arts college, a printing press, a vegetarian health food co-op, elementary schools, and a sanitarium. Since then, gentrification has brought in academics and political consultants who restored many of the areas group houses into Victorian mansions. Unlike many surrounding areas, Takoma Parks "Old Town" commercial district has resisted the influence of chain stores.  Following the onset of gentrification, nearby  Mount Rainier  has reclaimed the mantle of DCs hippest suburb, as rastafarians, pyramid healers, and other bohemian residents have fled to the artsy area around Glut Food Co-op.  Hyattsville , an area often confused with  Langley Park (see below)  has also received an influx of artists and is planning an arts district along Route 1.  More densely forested than the surrounding city, with huge oak trees, Takoma Park is known as a "tree city"and is bisected by numerous steep hills, narrow streets at odd angles, and the gorge-like Sligo Creek Park.  Of principal interest to tourists, a network of bicycle trailsfollow Sligo Creek Park for twelve miles into neighboring areas, connecting the old, pre-war suburbs of  Hyattsville  and Greenbelt to  Silver Spring  and Wheaton, Maryland.  Plans are being made to extend the trail system via Maple Avenue and Wayne Avenue to the existing Capitol Crescent rail trailthrough  Silver Spring ,  Georgetown  and  Bethesda .  Nearby  Silver Spring , Maryland is much larger, and similarly diverse. One stop north on the Metro, Downtown Silver Spring is more commercialized and densely developed than downtown Takoma Park (which straddles the DC line) but somewhat similar in terms of population, and the variety of shops and ethnic restaurants on the poorer side streets. Silver Spring is sometimes considered a haven for documentary filmmakers.    Both areas are extremely densely populated suburbs with many El Salvadorean, African and Asian immigrants. Together with nearby  Langley Park  and  Hyattsville , they form an area that is one of the most politically liberal districts in the U.S. and home to a sizable percentage of Marylands immigrant population.  The Old Town area of Takoma Park is composed of three historic districts which run along Carroll Avenue from 4th Street NW (in Washington, DC) to Takoma Junction in Maryland.  This is an artsy, counter-cultural area anchored by the Metro station, Takoma Theater, the Washington Operawarehouse and the House of Musical Traditions.  Another nearby major strip is in  Langley Park, Maryland . The "International Corridor"of Piney Branch Road and University Boulevard in  Silver Spring  and  Langley Park, Maryland  forms the outer border of Takoma Park.  The businesses and apartments along this 5-mile stretch of road are almost entirely immigrant-oriented, with prized local eateries from  El Salvador  and  India .   In 1997, Takoma Park voted to partially secedefrom Prince Georges County.  After getting permission from the State, they immediately turned around and voted to annex an area known as Hells Bottomfrom Prince Georges County, before the secession went into effect.  This long-neglected area, once a haven for rum-running during Prohibition, resembles a small town in West Virginia, with tiny shotgun houses perched on steep hills overlooking the DC line.  Because of its proximity to the Silver Spring estate of noted abolitionist Montgomery Blair (after whom the local high school is named, and whose family continues to own part of downtown Silver Spring), Takoma Park is also home to two former Freedmens Villagesfrom the Civil War era.  One of these is now a high-rise apartment district along Maple Avenue, while the other was built on the site of an old Civil War fort and amusement park located on Sligo Creek. It is now populated by art housesin addition to the historically black community near Sligo Creek.  A similar Freedmens Village, much more preserved, is on Hawkins Lane in the affluent town of  Bethesda, Maryland .  See also  Takoma (Washington, D.C.)</field>

Established in 1905, the town was named after Montillus (Montillion), Murray "Old Man" Beatty, who settled on a ranch in the Oasis Valley in 1896 and became the towns first postmaster. With the arrival of the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad in 1905, Beatty became a railway center for the Bullfrog Mining District, including mining towns such as nearby Rhyolite. Starting in the 1940s, Nellis Air Force Base and other federal installations contributed to the towns economy as did tourism related to Death Valley National Park and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center.  Beatty is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society, a casino, and hundreds of motel rooms and recreational vehicle spaces. The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum  (a sculpture park), are both about 4 miles to the west, and Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site are about 18 miles to the east.</field>

		<field name="content">Grand Junction might aptly be described as a "suburb without a city." This does not mean that the area lacks a vibrant downtown; rather Grand Junction offers the outlet stores and conveniences of a suburb, but without the big city problems of traffic jams, pollution and high crime. Grand Junction is the only major commercial and transportation hub between  Denver  and  Salt Lake City . Yet it derives its name not from the railroads, but from the Colorado River, formerly named the Grand. The city it located at the confluence, or junction, of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers.   Grand Junction is an ideal spot to plan a series of day trips to the surrounding natural beauty of  Southwestern Colorado  and northeastern  Utah . But the city should not be overlooked for its own attractions. There are a variety of things to do in Grand Junction. Dinosaur museums, wine tasting, fine dining, excellent shopping, arts and theater, pedestrian malls and outdoor recreation combine to make this a location worth enjoying.  Surrounded by mesas, the Grand Valley is an area of high desert beauty. To the North are the austere tan bluffs of the Bookcliffs, which culminates in Mount Garfield, an icon of the area. To the east lie the evergreen slopes of the Grand Mesa, largest flattop mountain in the world, and home to many great activities such as skiing, hiking, fishing and horse back riding. (No fall trip to the mesa would be complete without a drive to see the changing aspen leaves). To the South are the red sandstone formations of the  Colorado National Monument . You can visit all these mesas, since they are interlaced with a variety of roads, as well as hike-able and bike-able trails.   Because of the areas (usually) mild winters and spectacular scenery, locals joke about "Chief Ourays Curse," named after the Native American Ute leader who used to live in the region. The curse says that once youve visited the Grand Valley, youre destined to return again and again.</field>

		<field name="content">Bedford-Stuyvesant is a major African-American neighborhood with some African presence. It is the second largest African-American neighborhood in the country after the city of Detroit. Bed-Stuy, as it is called by most New Yorkers, has been gentrifying lately. However violent crime is a still a concern along with the other social problems in the community. Flatbush was formerly a Jewish, Italian, and Irish neighborhood, and before that settled by members of the Dutch Reformed Church. It is now a largely West-Indian neighborhood, and is the home of Brooklyn College, one of the most beautiful campuses in the area. In the very center is the 18th Century Dutch Reformed Church at the corner of Flatbush and Church Avenues, and its original school house dating to 1787 and originally called Erasmus Hall. Now it is the administration building of the public Erasmus Hall High School, its own building over 100 years old. The neighborhoods eponymous commercial main street, Flatbush Avenue, goes from the Manhattan Bridge on the north to the Gil Hodges Marine Parkway Bridge leading to the Rockaway Peninsula section of Queens on the south. Crown Heights is largely a mixture of West Indians and Chasidic Jews. Part of the neighborhood is near the  Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum . Violent crime is a still a concern along with the other social problems in the community so use caution. Midwood is a quiet residential area with some commercial streets, located on the other side of the Brooklyn College campus from Flatbush and extending for some ways to the south. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed, but includes a substantial population of Modern Orthodox Jews and some Chasidim, and many shops are closed on Saturdays and Jewish holidays. The area has one of New York Citys largest concentrations of beautiful free-standing hundred-year-old Victorian and Edwardian homes. An interesting example of this is the Avenue H station house on the Q subway line, which was first built a century ago as the local real estate office selling these homes. It is a historic site and a unique fixture among the citys subway system. (See The Little Station House in the Woods    for more information.) Brownsville is another mainly African-American neighborhood. It is just to the west of  East New York , and like East New York, it remains among the more dangerous neighborhoods in New York, though crime statistics have declined in recent years, and does not merit a visit from most tourists. Beware passing through here on your way to JFK Airport on the B15 bus.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Once a working-class, largely Eastern European neighborhood, the "Nordeast" has recently seen an influx of young professionals and artists. This demographic swing, combined with neighborhood revitalization efforts, have resulted in a resurgence of both commercial space and a thriving artistic community. Northeast Minneapolis, with its plethora of neighborhood bars and eating establishments, is becoming a nightlife hotspot for those wishing to avoid the cost and clientele of Downtown and Uptown drinking.  While Northeast is larger than you might think, a kind of downtown Northeast has formed in the Old St. Anthony area (which technically occupies about equal areas of both Northeast and  Southeast ) and continues to develop around the triangle of Hennepin Ave, University Ave, and Central Ave. This area houses a thriving commercial district with new and developing urban residential buildings.  Along the river on the Northeast side is St. Anthony Main, signed in neon as such and visible from the Hennepin Ave bridge. St. Anthony Main houses several good restaurants, bars, a movie theater, and businesses. It can be quite lively on warm summer nights, and often deserted during winter.  The city has designated the area bounded by Lowry Avenue, Central Avenue and Broadway as the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District. It includes most of the major studio buildings which are open during Art-a-Whirl every May: The Northrup-King Building near Central Avenue and 14th Avenue NE, the California Building south of Lowry at 23rd and California, the Thorp Building just north of the railroad tracks 1t 1620 Central Avenue, and the Grain Belt complex on the Mississippi River at Marshall Street and Broadway. There is also a small, arts-heavy commercial district on 13th Avenue NE between 2nd Street NE and 4th Street NE, including several prominent galleries, the Ritz Theater (reopened in 2006 as the home of Ballet of the Dolls), and bars and restaurants including the Modern Cafe and Erté.   From Old St Anthony, keep heading up Central Avenue. At first you will pass through a bleak industrial area, but afterwards you will find a thriving commercial strip along Central stretching from 18th Avenue onwards. A hub of Indian groceries and stores is around 19th Avenue, and another hub of Middle Eastern and Latin American restaurants and stores has emerged around Lowry Avenue and Central Avenue. Once you pass 27th Avenue, the activity drops off and the street turns mostly residential on the east side and with the Shoreham rail yards and Columbia Park (largely occupied by a golf course) on the west side. Commerce picks up again just north of the city limits of  Columbia Heights  at 37th Avenue.</field>

		<field name="content">Although Native Americans have lived in Kansas for thousands of years and the first Europeans visited in the 1600s, most Kansas communities date from the early to mid-1880s. The real development of Kansas didn’t take place until the 1850s when pro-slavery settlers from Missouri and antislavery settlers from New England flooded into the area. This period of  "Bleeding Kansas" included a great deal of violence and some people consider this area to have been the cradle of the Civil War. In communities like Lawrence, Kansas many organizations and businesses still proudly display the "free state" name.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">For a Californian town, Oroville has had a rather extensive history.  It was the first major town in the area and grew enormously in the mid-19th century due to the Gold Rush, after which it slowly transitioned in to being the seat of Butte County, one of Californias poorest.  Constantly overshadowed by neighboring  Chico  (due to the university campus there), Oroville has spent most of its post-Gold Rush existence quietly serving administrative purposes with some unfortunate race tensions in the middle of the 20th century.  Since the construction of the massive dam which in turn created Lake Oroville, outdoor tourism has become one of the main draws of the town and more people have moved there as it becomes a "bedroom community" of towns such as Chico and even Sacramento.  Visitors to Oroville will more than likely be spending their time hiking or on the lake as the town proper, while having a nice, old historical area, isnt heavy on cultural attractions.</field>

		<field name="content">Travelers speeding by on I-10 between western New Mexico and Tucson could be forgiven for assuming theres not much to see in this remote corner of Arizona. The only real clue is the Texas Canyon rest stop on I-10; theres little else to suggest that theres more here than tumbleweeds and rocks. Leave the interstate, however, and soon you find yourself in storied cowboy and Indian country: the land of Wyatt Earp and the Clanton brothers, and of Geronimos last stand. Theres much more than that here, though, as the oldest documented evidence of human inhabitants anywhere on North America is located in this region. To really experience all of this the traveler should leave the highway, and, ideally, the pavement.  Culturally there is a long history of human activity here, beginning with the Clovis culture approximately 9000 BCE, and continuing through the pre-Columbian and early Spanish periods. Besides scattered petroglyphs and pictographs and adobe ruins, however, theres little from this early history for the traveler to easily appreciate. In contrast, the regions more recent Apache, Mexican, and American history is inescapable. With the exception of the Chiricahua Apaches, who were sadly forcibly removed in the 19th century, the influence of this cultural melange continues to the present day.  Geographically the region is characterized by basin and range topography punctuated by Madrean Sky Islands, a landscape which is unique to southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora, Mexico. The desert valleys are hot and arid, while the mountain ranges are covered by cool pine and oak forests, with corresponding cooler temperatures.</field>

In the late 19th century, West Bridgewater was a small farming community. Today there still exists many fields, corn fields, and a couple farms. Many current residents choose to live in West Bridgewater for couple of reasons. For example the public school system remains one of the only insitutions that has around 99% of its students pass the "MCAS" test each year. West Bridgewater is also located about 25 minutes south of Boston and provides an easy commute to work for many of its residents. The town has a total area of 15.8 sq. miles and borders neighboring  such as Brockton to the north, Bridgewater to the south, East Bridgewater to the east, and Easton to the west. West Bridgewater is located on the historic Hockomock Swamp and the Town River passes through the southern portion of town.</field>

Twin Falls is the principal city of the Magic Valley region of Idaho, so named because said irrigation projects "magically" transformed the harsh landscape into productive farmland. While agriculture remains one of the citys primary industries, its proximity to outdoor activities as well as to casino gaming in nearby  Nevada  give it a regional tourist flair. Twin Falls is home to over 40,000 residents, making it one of Idahos principal cities outside the  Boise  metro area.</field>

		<field name="title">Cincinnati</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Formerly known as Losantiville, the city was renamed Cincinnati by the first governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, a society named after Roman consul Cincinnatus and founded at the end of the Revolutionary War. Many members of the Society were prominent men in the early years of the United States.  The citys early economy was based on the pork industry, and this was celebrated in the summer of 2000 with the Big Pig Gig, during which large flying pig statues took up residence along the citys main thoroughfares. Many of these pig statues later found homes downtown in offices, parks and even private residences.  The Miami and Erie canal was completed in the 1840s, and was used to transport hogs and butchered pork products to Cincinnati from much of western Ohio.  During this time period massive waves of Germans settled into the city populating neighborhoods which at their height in the late 1800s were some of  the most densely populated outside of New York City.  These German immigrants built a culture based on beer gardens, beer brewing, dance and music halls giving Cincinnati a very distinct and vibrant local culture.  Unfortunately very little remains from this era due to both World War I anti-German backlash and the prohibition of alcohol in 1920. Lately, with the beginnings of revitalization of the Downtown Basin neighborhoods, there has been a renewed interest in this heritage and some of it can be seen to this day in faded German signs on densely built ornate Victorian buildings in Over-The-Rhine,  a high per-capita number of bars, and the celebration of large German festivals such Bockfest, Mayfest, and the largest Oktoberfest celebration in the United States.  Cincinnati also has a charming riverboat heritage that dates back to the days when large, steam and paddle-wheel driven vessels were used to transport locally produced pork products. In recognition of this tradition, the city plays host to the Tall Stacks Festival once every few years, during which time the river front is transformed into a mass of color, with river boats of all shapes and sizes jostling for positions along the river banks.  Baseball is another Cincinnati tradition, and the Cincinnati Reds were the first professional baseball team in the United States; in deference to that, Opening Day is always a home game for the Reds, held at Great American Ball Park.   Cincinnati has a thriving local industrial economy and is home to many businesses ranging from manufacturing to services, including General Electric, Procter and Gamble, Fifth Third Bank, Milacron, Kroger, Federated Department Stores, and the American Financial Group.  In World Wars I and II, Cincinnatis local machine tool companies, such as LeBlond (now Makino) and the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company (now Milacron), played an important role, providing what is commonly considered the best machine tool technology in the world for its time.  Recently, Cincinnati has seen some large scale revitalization projects, such as the construction of Great American Ball Park and Paul Brown Stadium, the reconstruction of Fountain Square, the construction of the first phase of the Banks neighborhood (which will eventually include, a hotel, shopping, houses and entertainment) and the beginnings of restoration of Over-The-Rhine through the "Gateway Quarter".  This has given the central areas of Cincinnati a vitality that hadnt been around for decades, though it is still very much a work in progress with other projects like a Streetcar line connecting Downtown to the University on the horizon.  This progress did not come easy.  For instance, county officials, city government, and area residents were flabbergasted that large scale projects like "The Banks" were undeveloped for over 10 years while the smaller cities of  Newport  and  Covington , across the Ohio River, continued to develop their riverfronts and draw visitors away from Cincinnati.  However the tide seems to be flowing back in Cincinnatis favor, time will tell as these developments mature.</field>

Canandaigua became the county seat of Ontario County, which at the time encompassed the entirety of New York west of Seneca Lake.  From then until the  Erie Canal  opened in 1823, Canandaigua was the largest and most important community in Western New York.  Once the Canal opened, Canandaigua was surpassed in prominence by  Buffalo  and  Rochester .  But it continued to grow and in 1913 incorporated as a city.</field>

The military and college communities, along with business opportunities and Mexican immigration, have contributed to the citys growth and change over the years.  The city was founded in the late 1800s outside a new Army post, Fort Concho.  The founder, Bartholomew DeWitt, named it "Santa Angela" after his wife, Carolina Angela.  This was eventually shortened to "San Angela."  The final change came in 1883 when the US Postal Service informed the town that the name was grammatically incorrect (san can only be used before a male name).  Rather than revert to the original name, they simply changed it to "San Angelo."  The city has benefited economically from agriculture, the oil and gas industry, and after World War II, the US Air Force presence in the form of Goodfellow Air Force Base.  Today, San Angelos economy is largely supported by its two hospitals, telecommunications, agriculture, the university, and the regions largest employer, the Air Force.   Even though this city has over a 100,000 people, the locals will still notice if youre not from around here.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Brownstones in downtown Jersey City Jersey City is the second-largest city in New Jersey, trailing  Newark  in population, but far surpassing Trenton, the state capital.  It is located on a peninsula that includes  Hoboken  to the north, the Hudson River and Manhattan to the east,  Bayonne  to the south, and the Hackensack River to the west.  Once a humming center of industry, Jersey City housed the booming factories of Colgate and Dixon-Ticonderoga. Once a railroad hub, the rail lines of the countrys great railroads, including the famed Pennsylvania Railroad, criss-crossed the city, bringing new immigrants into the American hinterland. Today, Jersey City is neither of these things. Decades of government mismanagement and disappointments had a profound effect on this once booming town. A fear of urban areas caused significant "white flight" to the suburbs in the middle of the 20th century; once affluent areas became centers of poverty and crime. Jersey City was a mirror of what was happening in New York City itself, although perhaps to a more significant and depressing degree.  During the 1970s, immigrants began moving to Jersey City in droves, attracted by cheap real estate and a chance at experiencing the storied American dream. Today, these immigrants have helped to shape the city into a melting pot of the worlds cultures and ethnicities. Nowhere in the state is there a city as diverse and as interesting as Jersey City in this respect.  Later, the growing popularity of New York City in the 1990s had a significant impact on Jersey City, too. Old railyards along the waterfront became the sites of gleaming new office towers and high-rise condominiums. Brownstones further inland were fixed up by people moving back into the city. Jersey Citys renaissance quickly began.  The city has gone through significant transformations over the course of its lifetime. And its not over yet. High-rises continue to sprout up along the waterfront like weeds, attracting Manhattanites priced out of the real estate market there, while offering quick commutes to jobs in Downtown Manhattan and Midtown. Office towers continue to fill up with new tenants, including the backoffice functions of many New York City-based companies, earning it the moniker "Wall Street West." (In fact, Jersey City has more Class "A" office space than downtown Pittsburgh or Atlanta.) New stores catering to Jersey Citys new gentry continue to pop up almost weekly. Its a city in transition, and its both exciting and frightening at the same time.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">As is true for most small towns located in the Platte River valley of Nebraska, the earliest history of Sutherland can be traced to the westward migration.  The Oregon-California trail generally ran south of the South Platte river, while the Mormon trail ran north of the North Platte river.  In 1843, the Oregon-California trail began to see heavy traffic, and in 1847, the first contingent of Mormons traversed the trail.  O’Fallon’s Bluff, just southeast of Sutherland, was a famous landmark referred to by many travelers in their journals.  In the days of the trails, the river ran along the base of the bluff.  Wagons would converge in this bottle-neck from along a fairly wide path and move single-file between the bluff and the river.  During the years 1858 to 1860, there was a trading post, stage station and Post Office near O’Fallon’s Bluff.  By 1866, troops sent to protect the wagon trains from ambush near O’Fallon’s Bluff had established Fort Heath.  In 1867, the O’Fallon’s railroad siding, depot and Post Office were built north of the river opposite the bluff.  It included a trading post and saloon.  In 1869, after the completion of the overland railroad, “Cody Siding” was established along the Union Pacific near the site of present-day Sutherland.  Though the settlement was quite well established, it was not until 1891 that the railroad platted an official “town”.  A post office was established in 1892, and the village of Sutherland, named for railroad official George Sutherland, was incorporated in 1905.  Though originally a thriving community that boasted an Opera House, several hotels, a movie theater, a bowling alley and numerous stores, Sutherland has most recently developed into a bedroom community to the larger North Platte located twenty-five miles east.  The primary occupation in the area is farming and ranching, although a large number of people are employed at Nebraska Public Power District’s Gerald Gentleman generation station five miles south of Sutherland, and at Union Pacific’s Bailey Railroad Yard, located in  North Platte .  The ethanol industry is very important to Sutherland, with an existing plant producing nearly 25 million gallons of ethanol annually, and an expansion underway to produce 120 million gallons from corn grown locally.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Midland was founded in 1885 as a railroad stop on the barren west Texas plains, and named for its location midway between  Fort Worth  and  El Paso .  Since then, Midland has served as a center for agriculture, ranching, and transportation for the southern plains.    Midland was a relatively small town until the discovery of oil in the 1920s, when it was quickly transformed into the administrative hub of the Permian Basin. One of the worlds largest petroleum-producing regions, today the basin supplies nearly 20 percent of the countrys oil and gas output, and thousands of people are employed locally to extract it.    Nowhere is the oil influence more visible than downtown, where the streets are lined by high-rise office buildings constructed by oil companies. The Bank of America Building is reputably the tallest building between Fort Worth and  Phoenix , and the Wilco Building is only a little shorter.  The Petroleum Building is a beautiful example of architecture from the roaring twenties, while Claydesta Center (a business park of several 5 6 story buildings) showplaces the splendour of the heyday of Midlands Oil Business.  The oil crash in the late 1980s dealt a firm blow to the area, and Midland fell into a bit of disrepair, but has since bounced back and is chugging along.  Notable former residents are George W Bush and Laura Bush, in their younger years.</field>

		<field name="content">The South Rim at Big Bend National Park   Big Bend National Park is named for the huge left-turn the Rio Grande makes as the river snakes its way through the  Texas  desert mdash; creating a natural boundary with  Mexico  and giving the state its distinctive bottom shape. Covering 801,163 acres (324,219 hectares) but with only 300-350 thousand visitors a year, Big Bend is one of the largest national parks in the lower 48 states yet one of the least visited. Most of the park is backcountry mdash; the brunt of activity is clustered around the few developed areas. Even during the busiest times, hitting a desert trail or backroad is all thats needed to find solitude; the rest of the year is so uncrowded, youll feel like you have the park to yourself.  The busy season is from mid-November through the first of week of January (especially Thanksgiving weekend and the weekends near Christmas and New Years Day) and again during Spring Break, when local college students get a week-long break (usually mid-March through April). Unless youre already in the area, Big Bend does not make a good day trip; the distances are just too vast. Ideally, plan on spending at least one full day in the park, though there is more than enough here for longer stays.   Pets are not allowed on trails, off the road, or on the river; there are no kennels in the park and the temperatures and wildlife can be hazardous mdash; consider leaving Fido at home.</field>

The distances are vast in the United States, and many people do not allow sufficient travel time, especially when they are used to the distances in European and Asian countries.  Many of Monument Valleys visitors are European and Japanese, and it is difficult for them to comprehend the distances you have to travel between destinations.  If you travel from Las Vegas or Phoenix, your trip will take almost the entire day.  You cannot see Monument Valley and also go further than the Grand Canyon to the South, and Moab to the North in the same day.

		<field name="content">Erie is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the state of Pennsylvania.  However, in terms of size and stature, there is a clear gulf between the first and second cities ( Philadelphia  and  Pittsburgh ) and the second-tier cities, like Erie, Allentown, Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre , and  Harrisburg .  Erie is roughly in the center of Pennsylvanias only coastline, bordering Lake Erie.  The city itself sits on Presque Isle Bay, which is formed by a long, narrow peninsula known as Presque Isle that reaches from the west around the north of the city.  Erie was founded in 1795 after the purchase of the surrounding territory from  New York .  It made its mark on history during the early 19th century, when Commodore Oliver Hazard Perrys small fleet of warships used the bay (then known as Misery Bay) to regroup and repair between skirmishes with the British fleet on Lake Erie.  (A reconstruction of the Brig "Niagara" can be found at the Erie Maritime Museum.)  The late nineteenth century brought industrial development, primarily heavy equipment and the locomotive industry.  Like many other cities in the so-called rust belt, this development has slowly withered away to outside competition, with the notable exception being General Electric, which maintains a large and active presence in the rail industry (GE Rail).  Eries climate is similar to most of the Northern United States, but with a big winter twist known as lake effect snow.  Snowfall amounts vary wildly within a 40 mile zone south of the lake.  Most of the time the immediate vicinity of the lake receives light snowfall, and the range from three to fifteen miles receives a whollop.  Snowfalls are also generally heavier as you go east.  The NY/PA border region typically receives the most snow until you move far enough away from the lake for the effects to diminish.  The roads are well maintained, but some snow squalls come on so suddenly, it is impossible to keep up.  If you are driving in the winter, be prepared with emergency gear.  The good news is that by January, it is often cold enough for Lake Erie to freeze over, greatly diminishing the lake effect.</field>

True to form in the Midwest, settlers tended to gravitate toward rivers and established their communities there.  Today, many of the States major cities are based on rivers including Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, Davenport, Dubuque, Sioux City and Council Bluffs.  For many years, agriculture was the primary industry of the state but recently, the States population has tended to urbanize resulting in a diverse mixture of industries.  Agriculture, though significantly diminished as the economic driver of the state, is still a major economic component.  Though Iowa has long been considered a rural state, it has a surprisingly rich cultural scene.  The University of Iowa in Iowa City is home to a number of major programs including the Iowa Writers Workshop, a program that has trained a number of Americas great modern writers.  Iowa State University in Ames is also a major driver of culture in the central part of the State.  A number of prominent liberal arts college also dot the state including Grinnell, Cornell, Coe and Luther.</field>

		<field name="content">Nevada achieved statehood in 1864, becoming the 36th state, despite its tiny population.  The primary purpose of this early grant of statehood was to pack congress with two more Senators and thus help preserve Northern/Republican dominance in the post-civil war era. At the time, Nevadas economy was dominated by the mining industry, thus tying the state to the industrialized North.  Nevada was also seen as a counterbalance to the more agrarian and confederate-sympathizing California.    Over the years, Nevadas economy has diversified somewhat into agriculture, light industry, distribution, and gaming.  However, over 87% of the land in Nevada is still owned by the Federal Government.  There are fairly large cultural differences between Urban and Rural areas, and therefore they are treated separately here.</field>

Since it is unincorporated, the residents of Aloha will not get to vote on annexation, although the State of Oregon currently has a protection in place against possible takeover.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Westchester County ranks number two (after NYC) for wealthiest counties in New York State and the seventh wealthiest county nationally. Westchester has long been associated with "old money" and some of the countrys wealthiest families for generations have lived "upstate" to escape the crowds of New York City but close enough to the Big Apple for business or pleasure. The county maintains its rural appeal with thousands of acres of parks and through a political system of townships containing villages containing hamlets that discourages large cities and preserves small municipalities. Although Westchester is home to nearly one million residents, a village like Briarcliff Manor has a population just under 8,000. Small businesses abound in the towns and villages and youll need to visit the larger cities and towns like Yonkers, White Plains and Mt Kisco, to find national chain stores and malls.     European settlement of the area began with emorous tracts of farmland held by Dutch manor lords and some of their place names continue to this day, Tappan Zee (the Tappan sea), Peekskill (Peeks creek), and Verplank (from van der Planken, near the bridge). Other names honor the Native Americas who lived here like Ossining (from the Sint Sinck tribe), Mount Kisco (allegedly named for Chief Cisqua), and the Kitchiwan neighborhood of Ossining (Kitchiwank tribe).</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Celebrating its 150th year in 2009, and located in southeastern  Washington , with the charming rejuvenation of its downtown and booming wine industry, Walla Walla has become a pleasant stop for tourists and new residents alike as they flee the larger cities of the coast and California — be it for a weekend get-away or something more long-term.   Known originally for its funny name and famous Walla Walla Sweet Onions, the long-established farming community with an "Old West" history has seen a major shift in agriculture in the last decade as traditional crops have been replaced by the vineyards of the rapidly growing wine industry. Walla Walla is at the heart of wine country, boasting over one hundred wineries – including some of the area and nations best cellars – with tasting rooms conveniently located downtown, around the airport, and throughout the scenic countryside.   But dont expect the stodginess of elitist wine areas elsewhere; the area is still an affordable and welcoming community with small town roots, and theres plenty to do besides taste the vino. Walla Walla also offers a taste of Oregon Trail history in Fort Walla Walla and the Whitman Mission, gorgeous views in the country, a charismatic Main Street, and the liveliness of a college town: hosting both the prestigious private liberal arts school Whitman College and private SDA Walla Walla University in neighboring  College Place . And should the wine bars and tasting rooms get to be too much, you can always escape into a classically red-neck bar, many of which are clustered near the Washington State Penitentiary in the northeastern part of town.  This town is also the seat of Walla Walla County.  The valley itself offers a diverse variety of striking landscapes: bordered by the Columbia River basin and its desert beauty as you enter from the west, rolling wheat fields and vineyards through the surrounding countryside, and the scenic Blue Mountains to the southeast.  Expect the best of the four seasons with cold and snow in winter, temperamentally sunny springs, blustery winds and fog in the fall, and golden sun warmed days of a hot, dry desert summer.</field>

Amarillo is also gateway to  Palo Duro Canyon , Americas second largest canyon. With its relatively mild climate, the city is rated as having some of the cleanest air in the country. Indians, conquistadors, buffalo hunters, settlers, cowboys, adventurers, lawmen, gunfighters, and the railroad all contributed in many ways to the development and growth of the area. That heritage is still felt here, where "cowboy" is still an honorable profession. Here you can enjoy the very best of the Old and New West! Founded in 1887, the city charter was adopted in 1913. Amarillo is one of the first cities in the nation to use the City Commissioner-City Manager form of government. Now home to approximately 185,000 residents, the city features excellent accommodations, a spacious convention/civic center, symphony, ballet, little theater, opera, and is the home of Amarillo College.  Though technically located on the very northern tip of the  Llano Estacado Plateau , Amarillo has closer ties with the  High Plains  region, serving as the economic, industrial, transportation, and cultural hub of the region.</field>

Missouri is known as the "Show Me State" – meaning one should back up talk with proof. The slogan is not an official one, but it does appear on the license plates. It is an endearing statement that people from Missouri say, "Im from Missouri, you have to Show Me!".  Travelers may not have heard much of Missouri, but rest assured that a welcome awaits all. Tourism is a trickle compared to the western or eastern-most states, and this is reflected in the treatment of tourists and travelers: strike up a conversation with any Missourian in line at the store, a museum, or a cafe and if you smile and tell them youre "not from around here" youll have a fount of information all for you.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The territory that now encompasses Bettendorf was opened to white settlement following the Black Hawk Purchase of 1832. The first European-American settlers established a village which they called Lillienthal, after an early tavern and dance hall. The village of Gilbert developed alongside Lillienthal in 1858, honoring Elias Gilbert, who platted the original site. At that time, the residents were predominantly German immigrants and worked as farmers, skilled laborers, and small business owners. The two villages eventually combined to become the town of Gilbert.  The town gave William and Joseph Bettendorf 70 acres along the riverfront on the condition that they move their iron wagon business from Davenport to Gilbert. In 1903 the town petitioned for incorporation and requested that its name change to honor the brothers whose factory was a major economic influence in the early development of the city.  The first modern-day riverboat casinos in the United States were launched in Bettendorf on April 1, 1991 by local businessman Bernard Goldstein. He went on to found the Isle of Capri Casinos. According to the 2010 census Bettendorf is home to 33,217.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Three local favorites, Pilsen   Pilsen was originally settled by Irish and German immigrants, who came to work at the factories and stockyards nearby. Those industries attracted Czech immigrants next, and in the late 1800s, the neighborhood was named in honor of the  city  back home in  Bohemia . The streets of Pilsen still bear their mark — weathered stone castles like St. Adalberts and Thalia Hall loom over buildings with colorful turrets and dashes of ornamentation completely absent of the Prairie School influence found elsewhere in Chicago.  In the 1960s, the construction of the University of Illinois at Chicago displaced a community of Mexicans from the  Near West Side , and many resettled in Pilsen. Though they inherited an area in economic decline, Pilsens new residents built a set of cultural institutions that far outpace many wealthier neighborhoods, crowned by the excellent National Museum of Mexican Art. And with the citys once-thriving West Side Italian community mostly wiped out by that same construction, a single block of the industrial Heart of Chicago neighborhood drew new focus as a place where Italian Chicago survived, remaining today as an alternative to the more heavily touristed Little Italy near the university.   Fears of gentrification began several years ago when the Podmajersky company began converting the old warehouses of East Pilsen into cheap studios for artists. Depending on who you ask, this was either intended to:   a) Revitalize the nearly vacant eastern half of an economically depressed neighborhood by creating spaces where exciting young artists could live, work, and exhibit, a "SoHo in Chicago";  b) Jump-start the process of gentrification that happened in  Wicker Park  several years earlier, driving up property values by exchanging low-income residents for wealthier ones looking to trade on that artistic "cool."  The artists arrived and opened galleries, but many left for lack of foot traffic. Most of those who remain have private studios, open to the public only for special events, giving East Pilsen the feeling of a ghost town on non-event days. There is an increasing split between the two halves of the neighborhood, and businesses seem torn between appealing to the working-class Mexican community already here and the affluent community that is still arriving. Whatever direction Pilsen may be headed, whats there now is an area with a long history of re-inventing itself, rough in places and full of inspiration, and guaranteed to provide visitors with an interesting day.   600px</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Mormon pioneers first settled in Utah and neighboring states in 1848 to avoid persecution and to live their faith, which included a belief in polygamy.  In 1890, amidst heavy pressure from the United States Government, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints renounced polygamy and to this day continues to forswear the practice.   Some Mormons, however, never accepted the church doctrine and Federal law that forbid polygamy.  They continued to practice "plural marriage". As their viewpoints were no longer accepted by the mainstream Church, they founded splinter groups such as the "Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" (FLDS) and usually lived in remote communities, keeping mostly to themselves.  Colorado City is one such community.  The city straddles the Utah/Arizona border.  Virtually all land in the community is owned by the United Effort Plan, a FLDS corporation.  Local government, including the police and public school, is run by church members.  While Colorado City has survived an infamous anti-polygamy raid in 1953 as well as the death of its founder, its future remains uncertain.  Detractors, including those formerly associated with the Fundamentalist community, say the church leader exercises extreme control over its members and on his orders may re-assign wives or banish men.  A State investigation began over allegations that some underage women were taken as brides in the community and that the local police worked to squelch any investigation about the practice.  Community members are also embroiled in a property tax dispute as well as disputes over attempts to evict dissenting residents.  On September 25th, 2007, Warren Jeffs, who FLDS adherents regarded as their leader and prophet, was convicted in a Utah court as an accomplice to rape, even though his only connection to the alleged victim was as officiant at her wedding.  In the year 2008, more attention was thrust on the community when Texas rangers conducted a botched raid on a FLDS ranch based on a crank phone call.  Some outside observers have commented that all this unwanted attention has caused the community to open up somewhat.  A handful of small shops have opened, and the presence of visitors is now more or less tolerated.  An unusual and uninviting place for tourists to go, Colorado City might nonetheless be a worthwhile stop for those undertaking a Mormon history tour, or for anyone who wants to see the results of a community that has struggled for years to isolate itself and maintain its own traditions.</field>

		<field name="content">Des Moines is the largest city in Iowa and the annual site of the Iowa State Fair.  Because of Iowas early caucus date the city is also a hotbed of political dreams and discourse every four years when presidential candidates tour the state and have multiple debates within the city.  The meaning of Des Moines itself is not clear as local Native Americans, the Moingona, had already been using a term (which meant river of the mounds) due to the number of burial mounds which were popular in the area.  French Trappist Monks (Moines de la Trappe) called their settlement areas at the mouth of the Des Moines River La Riviere des Moines which, in English, translates to the river of the monks. "De Moyn," which means "middle," may have been used on the map of explorer Jacques Marquette to help others locate the Des Moines River-area (equidistant between the larger Mississippi and Missouri rivers).  "Des Moines," today pronounced "duh MOIN," is located at the junction of the Des Moines River and the Raccoon River.  Fort Des Moines was settled in 1843 by a group of dragoons from the Sac and Fox Agency (Fort Sanford) led by Captain James Allen.  Originally, Allen was going to name the area Fort Raccoon but was instructed by the War Department to use the name Fort Des Moines.  In 1846, the Fort dissolved and the city was officially created.  In 2010, U.S. Census Bureau data estimated the population of Des Moines proper to be at 203,433;  the metro area has more than 500,000 residents.</field>

These battles are remembered through numerous battlefield parks and Civil War attractions located in and around the city.  In more modern times, the city has received national recognition for the renaissance of its once dilapidated downtown and redevelopment of its riverfront.  An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic Walnut Street Bridge, which is now the worlds longest pedestrian bridge.  Chattanooga is the corporate headquarters and home of Olan Mills, Blue Cross Blue Shield of TN, Rock Creek Outfitters, Krystal, Chattem, Unum, The Chattanooga Bakery (home of the Moon pie), and Miller Industries, the largest tow truck manufacturer in the world; Chattanooga is the birthplace of the tow truck. Chattanooga is also home to the Tennessee Valley Authority, a self-funding government agency which operates numerous power plants in the South.  Following the citys industrial decline, many businesses in the banking and insurance industries set up operations in Chattanooga.  The city is home to large branch offices of Cigna, ATT and UBS.  Within the last ten years the city has won 3 national awards for outstanding "livability", and 9 Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning.  As of the census of 2000, there are 155,554 people, 65,499 households, and 39,626 families residing in the city. There are 72,108 housing units at an average density of 205.9/km² (533.3/mi²). The racial makeup of the city is 59.71% White, 36.06% African American, 0.29% Native American, 1.54% Asian. 2.11% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">"Virginia Is For Lovers" is the enigmatic motto of the Virginia tourism council. What makes Virginia particularly suited for amour remains something of a mystery, but the state does have many great features: beaches, forests, some of the oldest towns in  North America , and proximity to the  Mid-Atlantic  and the deeper South.   Virginia is one of the thirteen original colonies, and one of the first states to ratify the Declaration of Independence. It is known as the "Mother of States" as its original territory included West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee.  It is also known as the "Mother of Presidents," as eight U.S. presidents were born in the state: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson.  What is known today as Virginia has been inhabited for many hundreds of years by people of European descent.  Jamestown, Virginia (near  Williamsburg ) is the site of the first lasting British settlement in the New World, dating to 1607.  Native American tribes from Virginia, such as the Powhatan, had some of the richest native cultures in the Colonies.  In colonial times, Virginia was settled mainly along the rivers that empty into the Chesapeake bay.  The settlers relied on slave labor to grow cash crops, such as tobacco, and relied on trade from England for basic needs.  While settlers primarily from England, Scotland, and Ireland settled along the Potomac, Rappahannock, and James Rivers, many German settlers migrated into Virginia from Pennsylvania along the Shenandoah Valley.  Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861 and has a strong Civil War heritage, as well as a strong sense of Southern pride and feeling of independence that exists in much of the state (especially the capital  Richmond ) even today.  Following the Reconstruction after the Civil War, Virginias economy shifted toward growing food crops in the north of the state, while the southern interior of the state continued to grow tobacco on smaller farms. The major shipyards at Norfolk continued to grow in importance as a major coal port and a naval base.    Following the growth of the US Federal Government during and after World War II, Northern Virginia grew at an astronomical pace as government workers and contractors settled across the Potomac River from Washington, DC.  Today, Virginias economy is dominated by military bases dotted all over the state, government contracting agencies, and residents who commute into Washington, DC.  Virginia Beach serves as a popular summer vacation spot and the Appalachian Mountains offer outdoor recreation.  Virginia is also a popular destination for history buffs as Virginia was a major player in much of Americas history.</field>

		<field name="title">Palmyra (New York)</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">In the late 1780s, a group of settlers from Connecticut tried to stake the states claim to land in  northeastern Pennsylvania , due to overlapping provincial charters.  Among those Connecticuters was one John Swift, a Revolutionary War veteran.  In 1789, with the venture in Pennsylvania bearing little fruit, Swift decamped for Western New York, where the Phelps and Gorham Purchase had large tracts of land for sale.  He purchased a tract (as did his fellow John Jenkins, though Swift soon bought him out) and in 1790 became the first permanent resident of what is now the Town of Palmyra.  Swifts land was centered on Ganargua Creek, and the community that sprouted up was initially known as Swifts Landing.  After a brief period known as Tolland, Swifts brother-in-law proposed the name Palmyra, and that is how the town was incorporated in 1796.  The town center grew slowly until 1825, when the Erie Canal opened.  The canals route took it right through Palmyra, necessitating an aqueduct over Ganargua Creek.  Energized by the new waterway, the village was quickly incorporated, in 1827.  During the period in which the Canal was built, at the height of the Second Great Awakening, the area between Rochester and Syracuse became a hotbed for religious fervor, known as the Burned-Over District.  Palmyra was a particularly prolific source of the newly devout.  In the mid 1820s, a local young adult named Joseph Smith (whose family lived just over the county line in nearby Manchester) claimed to have been visited by an angel, and directed to a set of buried artifacts on Hill Cumorah.  Among those artifacts, it is claimed, was a set of golden plates, which Smith alone could translate.  His translation became the Book of Mormon, which was published for the first time in Palmyra in 1830.  Despite that milestone, the area never embraced Smiths nascent religion (he had moved away in 1827 and never returned), and it wasnt until the year 2000 that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built a temple here.  But the founding is commemorated every year with the Hill Cumorah Pageant.</field>

		<field name="content">Gayborhood is located within Center City East. It is a square, taking up from about Broad and Walnut about 11th and Pine. Gayborhood is comprised of bars, restaurants and has a bookstore with its very own history: Giovannis Room (James Baldwin wrote a book with this title; he based it on the bookstore). Some places that attract large crowds are Woodys (Wednesday is college night), Pure and 12th Street Gym.  Chinatown is also located within Center City East, just blocks away from the Convention Center and Reading Terminal. Compared to the Chinatown of other cities, Philadelphias is fairly small. An important landmark to the town is the Friendship Gate, located at 10th and Arch streets. Chinatown is filled with restaurants, bakeries and gift shops. Some restaurants include Penang, Sang Kee, Banana Leaf and Tai Lake. Bakeries include Asia Bakery, Hong Kong Bakery, Mong Kok Station Bakery and KC Pastries. Many goods include milk tea, bubble tea (also known as boba tea) egg tarts, pork buns, steamed buns, chicken buns and pineapple buns.  Washington Square West is also located within Center City East: 7th to Broad Street, Chestnut to South Street, squished in between Rittenhouse Square and Old City/Society Hill. Home of Antique Row and Mid-Town Village, two great shopping districts. Historic cobbled streets, theaters, restaurants and more.  Washington Square is composed of several distinct neighborhoods and is convenient to Americas most historic square mile. Washington Square West is a lively neighborhood, while east of the park is a bit more sedate. Antique Row, Pine Street between about 13th and 9th Streets, is full of interesting shops, not all of them antiques-oriented. Washington Square itself is worth a visit to see the tomb of the unknown Revolutionary War soldier. This neighborhood is a good place to see Philadelphias native style of house, the "trinity" -- two, three, or four floors, one room per floor, connected by spiral stairs. The small streets above Pine, such as Quince Street, are lined with trinities.  WalkPhiladelphia  offers several interesting tours of Wash West. The Gayborhood is Philadelphias gay-friendly area overlapping the officially designated Washington Square West neighborhood. The  Gayborhood  is most strongly associated with 12th and 13th streets, especially from Pine in the south to Walnut in the north, but spills out to the surrounding areas. Most straight-owned Gayborhood businesses are friendly to the LGBT community and straights alike regardless of orientation. The Philadelphia City Hall is unofficially the center of Center City at Broad and Market Street. The building is topped by a 36 feet, 4 inches, bronze statue of William Penn. Under a gentlemans agreement,  City Hall  remained the tallest building in the city until 1987. Chinatown extends from approximately 8th Street to 11th Street east-west, and Vine Street to Market Street north-south. Despite the name, Philadelphias  Chinatown  has a variety of Asian ethnicities and has recently become one of the most popular neighborhoods for young people. The streets of are dominated by homes, restaurants, and boutique stores. Chinatowns symbol is its "Friendship Arch", an ornate paifang in the heart of the neighborhood. Though it is commonly found in many North American Chinatowns, the Arch Street incarnation is more elaborately rendered than most.</field>

The name "Pennsylvania Dutch" is actually a mispronunciation of "Deutsch" or German. The Anabaptists orginally came from Switzerland and were welcomed to Pennsylvania by William Penn and his descendents.  Although Lancaster county thrives on tourism, the Amish community does not particularly like visitors, tourists, or sightseers. They are generally an intensely private religious community doing their best to go about living according to the ways of their religion and culture, and very much wish to be left alone unless you are invited. Dont take photos without permission, or harass or otherwise pester them about their way of living. Above all else, dont trespass on private property.  There are official tourist exhibits set up by the local government and various private enterprises that will allow you to learn about the county and the Amish in a way that is respectful and positive for everyone involved.</field>

The community is almost entirely residential, consisting of a cluster of small cabins and trailers surrounded by a few larger houses, a church, a community center, a fire station, a campground and a small store. The name Cache La Poudre comes, according to local legend, from the label placed on the map of a French trapper to indicate where he had hidden a stash of gunpowder and is pronounced cash la pooder by locals.</field>

There are two main communities of the peninsula; the affluent Belle Harbor, and the predominantly African American Far Rockaway. While the peninsula has many serene beaches, it comes along with six dangerous public housing projects: The Redfern projects in Far Rockaway, the Beach 41st Street projects in Far Rockaway, the  Edgemere projects in Edgmere, the Averne projects in Edgmere, the Hammel projects in Rockaway Beach, and the Carleton Manor projects in Edgmere. In recent years Far  Rockaway has gotten bad press. In 2007 the 101st NYPD Precinct, which operates in Far Rockaway, had the highest percentage in crime increase. Far Rockaway has struggled with violent crime and drugs since the 1980s and continues to be somewhat dangerous even today. Though the Rockaways still have a far way to go before they become the paradise resort that they were in the mid-1800s, they shouldnt be avoided.</field>

The presence of Washington State University in similarly college culture-intensive Pullman less than 10 miles (16 km) away only adds to that feel.  Moscow is in the heart of a region known as the Palouse, noted for its rolling hills. Once outside the city and the universitys sphere of influence, agriculture becomes the driving force in daily life.</field>

Sarasota is also home to the Ringling Museum of Art, the Selby Botanical Gardens, New College (Floridas public honors college), a USF branch, and the Ringling School of Art and Design.  Sarasotas downtown comprises a true urban cityscape with offices and several upscale downtown condominiums.  It is complemented by Saint Armands Circle, on Saint Armands Key, which is surrounded by Lido Key, across Sarasota Bay from downtown via the Ringling Causeway (with sweeping views of Sarasota Bay.)  Saint Armands Circle is an upscale outdoor shopping area, with several cafes, reminiscent of Europe.  The idea for Saint Armands was from John Ringling who also intended to build a Ritz hotel on Longboat Key.  Today, Sarasota has a Ritz hotel downtown as well as the Longboat Key Club on Ringlings original site.  The Longboat Key Club includes two golf courses, tennis, and all other resort facilities and is located just north of Saint Armands on Longboat Key.  The beaches are a major draw to the area.  Siesta Key Beach is consistently ranked among the most beautiful beaches on Earth.  (Siesta Key was also the site chosen for the marriage of Chrissy and Brian, of Home Today fame.)  Crescent Beach, Turtle Beach, Lido Beach, and the beach running the 15 mile span of Longboat Key are equally beautiful and accessible.  Indeed, much of Sarasotas charm comes from the fact that the beaches are so plentiful and accessible.    Sarasota beaches are the Winner of the "Worlds finest, whitest sand,"</field>

		<field name="content">North Carolina, in many ways, represents the very best of both the New South and old Dixie.  Booming, diverse cities lie just "down the road" from quiet Southern towns where not much has changed since the Civil War.  The states metro areas, and especially the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham metros, have seen a rapid influx of migrants since the 1980s, with a significant number coming from the northeast and midwest, and the states internationally-born population has skyrocketed in recent decades.  These newcomers have added layers of culture and dynamism to the down-home Southern way of life that has defined the state since colonial days.  Because of this, visitors will find no shortage of cultural and culinary wonders throughout the state-- whether in experiencing the native Southern culture, which is very much alive and well, or the multitude of ethnic restaurants, off-Broadway shows, art galleries, and fine dining that have blossomed in recent years.  Despite the ever-evolving metro areas of the state, small towns throughout North Carolina remain deeply rooted in a past that goes back to America colonial foundlings.  From the shipwrecks of 17th century pirates off the Carolina coast to dramatic Civil War battlefields, North Carolinians are deeply proud of their heritage and place in American history.  Even with this shared heritage, visitors will notice a dramatic difference in food, culture and lifestyle as they travel from east to west in the state.  Travelers spending a leisurely afternoon beneath a Spanish-moss draped live-oak tree along a waterway in WIlmington will feel worlds away from a hiker exploring the most hidden corners of the Smokey mountains.  That said, throughout the state, even in the heart of downtown Charlotte or Raleigh, the ubiquitous easy-going and well-mannered way-of-life will always remind visitors that they are very much in the heart of the South.</field>

		<field name="content">Oklahoma State Capitol building  Oklahoma has a rich Native American past. In the 1830s Oklahoma was the end of  The Trail of Tears  and over 16,000 Cherokee Indian people were forced to move from their eastern homes by the United States government and were relocated to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. In addition the Five Civilized Tribes were relocated from the southeastern  United States . Oklahomas name is taken from two Choctaw words. "okla" means people and "humma" meaning red, so Oklahoma literally means "red people". Thirty nine tribes and Indian nations have their headquarters in Oklahoma.  Oklahoma has a recent pioneer past.  There are people alive today in Oklahoma that remember it as a frontier.  Oklahoma is most known to the outside world as the site of the tragic Oklahoma City Bombing.  The cost of living is among the lowest in the US and such includes the cost of tourist related activities.  Lodging, rental cars, fuel, and restaurants are lower in cost than nearly anywhere else in the US.</field>

The city embraces its cowboy and mining past but also looks toward the future with a vibrant arts and performing arts scene, dozens of great outdoor festivals, and distinct neighborhoods each offering a unique experience. Youll find everything a cosmopolitan city has to offer including a spectacular view of and easy access to the beautiful Rocky Mountains, which are only 12 miles west of town.  Denver does have its growing pains. Urban sprawl is becoming a problem, with the metropolitan area sometimes growing faster than the infrastructure can really handle, especially with public transportation. Denver is generally a driving city, and some problems with pollution and traffic are a part of everyday life. Large mass transportation and freeway expansion projects have recently been completed, including the popular light rail system.</field>

Each area has its own style and culture.  West Side is between the Franklin mountains and Mexico and New Mexico includes El Pasos most affluent neighborhoods along the side of the mountain. Providence Memorial Hospital, Sierra Medical Center, Las Palmas Medical Center, El Paso Country Club,  and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) are located here. The UTEP area ("Kern Place") is emerging as an entertainment district with restaurants and nightclubs also known as the "Cincinnati Entertainment District".  The Sun Bowl, Don Haskins center, and Centennial Gardens are all located on the UTEP campus.    Downtown is in the southern part of El Paso, just below the tip of the Franklin Mountains. The streets of Downtown are often difficult to navigate for first time visitors, especially with the current construction. Parking (there are many cheap areas to park your car for the day) is probably the best bet. Walking through Downtown, there are many little shops reminiscent of Mexico and many small cafes. Many of the buildings are historic and very beautiful. The Downtown area boasts a beautiful plaza in the center of the city. The El Paso Museum of Art, the Plaza Theater, El Paso Civic Center and a childrens science museum, Insights, are all located here. Extensive renovations are taking place in the Downtown area. Nearby on Paisano Street is the El Paso Zoo   .    North East El Paso is home to Fort Bliss Military Base.  Fort Bliss is one of the largest U.S. Military bases in the world and Northeast El Paso is home to many active and retired servicemen and women. Fort Bliss located near the airport with adjacent Biggs Army Airfield has a great influence on Northeast El Paso culture. Tours of Fort Bliss can be arranged, or if you know a service member, have them give you a tour. Outside of base are many military surplus stores.   East Side of El Paso is the fastest growing area mostly home to middle class working families.  The Socorro Student Activities Complex (SAC), Del Sol Medical Center, Las Palmas Marketplace, Cielo Vista Mall and Bassett Center are all located in East El Paso.  It is close to the Mission Trails area and  Hueco Tanks State Historic Site .</field>

Port Richmond is largely populated by people of Polish and Irish decent. Known for various Polish businesses as well as restaurants. This section of the city is known for its authentic Polish cuisine. Many different grade schools, public and parochial, are in Port Richmond. This area of the city is very convenient to Center City, Olde City, South Philly, the Northeast, as well as New Jersey via the Betsy Ross Bridge. Access to the El as well as the trolley and bus routes also make this area a great place to live and commute to different areas of the city. Affordable housing is also a perk of the Port Richmond area. This neighborhood is made up of mostly row homes and various types of apartments. Many businesses thrive along Aramingo Ave, which is a heavy populated avenue in this neighborhood.

Fine oysters and other seafood. Apalachicola or “Apalach“, was established in 1831. It was once the third largest port on the Gulf of Mexico. Wide, tree lined streets are still graced by picturesque homes from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries show the wealth and craftsmanship of its early days.  Apalachicola has over 900 historic homes and buildings listed in its extensive National Register District and it was selected as one of the nation’s Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2008 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  The Apalachicola basin encompasses what is considered one of the least polluted, most undeveloped, ecologically diverse systems left in the United States. The Apalachicola Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR) oversees the health of this vast system. The ANERR is the second largest in the nation with over 246,000 acres under its protection. Apalachicola’s vibrant history and rich maritime culture can still be seen on its working waterfront. Buildings that once served as 19th century ship’s chandleries, old net factories and a sponge warehouse now house a mix of eclectic and trendy shops, restaurants, galleries and meticulously restored hotels and B B’s.  These locally owned and operated businesses create a quaint and friendly atmosphere for visitors as well as local residents. A grand theater lies in the center of town (see "Do" below).</field>

Rogers was founded in 1881 by a railroad baron, and has a historic brick-streeted downtown from its heyday in this time period. However, in recent years, development has sprawled around Interstate 540, leaving some older parts of town run-down. Rogers is essentially a small town that has had widespread suburban development, leading to heavy traffic on arterial streets. Most of the city outside downtown is unfriendly to walkers and bikers.   Rogers offers fairly easy access to other cities in the region as well as rural areas in the Ozarks, with a wealth of outdoor and recreational opportunities.</field>

In 1875, a logger named Carl Lorenz built boats in Lakebay to carry his finished lumber to town. He later used these boats to ferry farmers and their produce to other areas. His boats were part of what later became known as the Mosquito Fleet. Lakebay also has their own post office with ZIP code 98349.

Today, the town serves as an interesting day-trip alternative for weary tourists looking to escape the capital, a treasure trove of early American architecture, a romantic getaway for metro-area residents, and a bedroom community for the white-collar workers that fuel the Federal labor mills to the north.

It is a popular BB spot or many come by boat for the good seafood and slow relaxed beauty of the place.  St. Michaels is an area rich in history.  In the dark morning hours of August 10, 1813, a number of British barges had planned an attack on the town and a fort on the harbor side. The residents of tiny St. Michaels, forewarned, hoisted lanterns to the masts of ships and in the tops of the trees, tricking the British by causing the cannons to overshoot the town. This first "blackout" was effective and only one house was struck. Now known as "The Cannonball House" a cannon ball penetrated the roof and rolled down the staircase as Mrs. Merchant carried her infant daughter downstairs. The house still exists as a private residence.  St. Michaels derived its name from the Episcopal Parish established there in 1677. The church attracted settlers who engaged in tobacco growing and ship building.  In 1805, an area was set aside for a public market known as "St. Marys Square". Here stands a bell cast in 1841 which rang at 7AM, noon, and 5PM to measure the workday for the ships carpenters in the nearby harbor and the remains of a cannon used in the defense of the town during the War of 1812.</field>

The city grew up primarily around industry and river traffic on the Wabash River.  The growth of the railroads and a short-lived oil boom contributed to the citys prosperity, but the decline of both, along with the Depression, resulted in the city becoming a model of Midwestern urban decay up through the 1980s.  Recent mayors have worked hard to reverse this image, and have begun making gains in turning the city back around.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Catskills mean different things to different groups of people. To most residents of the  Metro New York  area to the south, they evoke summer camps, weekend homes and the vast reservoirs that supply clean, pure water to New York City. To historians of American popular culture they are home to the majority of the "Borscht Belt" resorts, where many legendary entertainers honed their skills before predominantly Jewish audiences, and where a later generation thronged to a dairy farm for "three days of peace, love and music" called the Woodstock Music and Art Festival. To art historians, they are the landscapes that captivated Thomas Cole, Frederick Church and the other painters of the Hudson River School, Americas first homegrown art movement. To fly fishermen, they are the streams where the first dry flies were cast and tied in American waters, tested by Theodore Gordon and other legends of the sport. To hikers and naturalists, the 290,000 acres (1,150 km²) of "forever wild" land in the Catskill Parks Forest Preserve is an environmental treasure, the land where influential American nature writer John Burroughs grew up and which inspired him to write some of his most famous essays.   Yet for all these multiple meanings, no one is quite sure what "Catskill" originally referred to. Perhaps it was Henry Hudsons crew, seeing bobcats around the creek they stopped at, and then naming it "Catskill", which was extended to the distant mountains. Or the many Iroquois stockades along the riverbank, which the Dutch referred to as "kats". Or poet Jacob Kats, supposedly a shrewd land speculator. Or the Iroquois lacrosse sticks, a small Dutch ship, or a Mohican chief who lived in the area. Its all the more surprising since the range was generally referred to as the Blue Mountains until the early 19th century, when Washington Irvings works popularized the long-scorned Dutch name.  Even with general agreement on the name, its also hard to say where the Catskills begin and end, beyond the very abrupt boundary created by the Catskill Escarpment at the northeast corner of the range, where mountains suddenly rise to over 3,000 feet (900 m) above sea level from the valley floor. Communities far outside the Catskill Parks Blue Line, as far as the banks of the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers, claim to be or are considered to be in the Catskills. Perhaps the only real indicator is what a longtime resident once told historian Alf Evers: that as long as "there are two rocks for every dirt" in the soil, you are in the Catskills.</field>

		<field name="content">The area where the town of Camp Hill stands today was first settled in 1735 by people living on the west shore of the Susquehanna River, across from Harrisburg. This settlement was positioned on the main road to Harrisburg. In the mid 1800s the Cumberland Valley Railroad was built from the Susquehanna River to Carlisle. The railway expanded to Chambersburg and in 1839 a railroad bridge was build to Harrisburg connecting to the coal trains from the north. By the late 1800s one-third of the residents of Camp Hill were railroad workers. This increased the settlements population and on November 10, 1885 Camp Hill became a legalized town.   By the 1900s Camp Hill had become more of a suburb than a working town and most of its inhabitants commuted from the town to work across the river in Harrisburg. The town continued to grow throughout the 1900s as a fire department, several schools, shopping centers, retail establishments, and a variety of public works buildings were established. Today Camp Hill is a very pleasant little town with many shops and establishment. It is also conveniently located four miles outside of Harrisburg, nineteen miles from Carlisle, and thirty five miles from Gettysburg.</field>

Ithaca is very much a college town, but it is also home to very solid and vibrant permanent community. The town is small and surrounded by outdoor amenities.  Cornell University has the feel of the Ivy League school that it is, yet it excels in state-wide agricultural and veterinary research, and is the states land-grant university.

Visit the website for information on planning group accommodations including weddings, conferences, reunions, etc.  Tompkins County Chamber of Commerce  (607) 273 7080 Relocation packets, and information on local businesses.  Ithaca has a humid continental climate, and is markedly cooler than New York City. Winter is cold, sometimes bitterly so, with temperatures reaching 0 F or lower ten times per annum. There is also significantly more snow and more cloudy days than along most of the coast. The best time of year to visit is summer -- as it is the sunniest and driest season, days are pleasantly warm but rarely too hot, and nights are crisp. Fall is also pretty -- the fall foliage in the area rivals that anywhere in New England. Foliage peaks in early October. The first snowfall can occur as early as around Halloween.</field>

		<field name="content">The towns founding dates to the mid-1850s with the building of a flour operation, Forbes Mill, by James Alexander Forbes along Los Gatos Creek. The mills two-story stone storage annex has been preserved as a museum just off of Main Street.  The settlement that was established in the 1860s was originally named for the mill, but the name was changed to Los Gatos after the Spanish land grant. The town was incorporated in 1887 and remained an important town for the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains through the end of the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the town became a thriving agricultural town with apricots, grapes and prunes being grown in the area. Along with much of the Santa Clara Valley, Los Gatos became a suburban community for San Jose beginning in the 1950s, and the town was mostly built-out by the 1980s.  Downtown Los Gatos has retained and restored many of its Victorian-era homes and commercial buildings. Other notable buildings are the Forbes Mill annex, dating to 1880 and now housing a history museum; Los Gatos High School which dates from the 1920s; and the Old Town Shopping Center, formerly the University Avenue School (the school was established in 1882; the current buildings date to 1923).  A number of brick buildings in Downtown Los Gatos were destroyed or heavily damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, though the district was quickly rebuilt and has made a full recovery.</field>

Of the eight U.S. presidents who came from Virginia, two — Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe — were from Charlottesville, and two more came from neighboring counties.  Central Virginia was a major battlefield during the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. Jefferson, whom locals affectionately call "Mr. Jefferson," or "TJ," continues to cast a long shadow, particularly over local architecture.  Many of Charlottesvilles public buildings are made of brick and built in a Jeffersonian style, and many private homes are colonial. His home at Monticello and the Jefferson-designed University of Virginia have set the tone for the communities beautiful buildings. When visiting Charlottesville, be sure to stop by the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society to learn more about the areas rich history.   The culture of Charlottesville revolves around two points: the University of Virginia and the Historic Downtown Mall.  Charlottesville is a major cultural center for central Virginia, and features more fine dining, shopping, and entertainment than one might expect for a town of its size. Ensconced in beautiful Albemarle County, Charlottesville is also surrounded by vineyards and horse country - the best of all worlds.</field>

Many subway and bus lines go to or through Downtown Brooklyn. Brooklyn Heights is a residential neighborhood with elegant buildings and historic churches.

		<field name="content">Long Beach is a large coastal and port city in Southern California. It is situated at the very southeastern edge of  Los Angeles County , bordering both the city of  Los Angeles  and  Orange County , in a region known as the  Gateway Cities .    Long Beach is recognized as one of the most culturally diverse cities in America. It has large percentages of Latinos and Whites (non-hispanic), as well as very sizeable percentages of Blacks (non-hispanic) and Asians. As a whole, the city tends to have a more East-Coast/Midwest vibe when compared to the rest of the coastal California cities, so people from those regions of the country may find themselves a little more at home in Long Beach.  You may hear different people say different things about Long Beach; either wonderful or horrible things. This is because the city has quite a large population, with a density rate greater than that of nearby Los Angeles. Therefore, like other large cities, Long Beach encompasses everything, such as large industrial areas, struggling neighborhoods, quiet middle-class communities, and exclusive neighborhoods.   Long Beach has some nice people-gathering amenities and genuine tourist attractions, such as a world-class aquarium and the Queen Mary floating museum/hotel. Special events are also held in the city like the annual Long Beach Grand Prix (a premier racing event held on city streets) and the annual Long Beach Lesbian Gay Pride event. When compared to other areas like Hollywood, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and West L.A., Long Beach may not always be at the top of someones tourist visit to the Los Angeles area, but the city draws its fair share of visitors and has proven it can definitely hold its own.   The area code for Long Beach is 562. For emergency services, dial 911 from any phone.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Inner Harbors relatively shallow waters have long played second fiddle to Baltimores deep water harbors in the south of the city. Unable to accommodate large freighters, the port received light freight and passenger traffic, but even in these categories, the Inner Harbor lagged behind the busier docks at  Fells Point . Consequently, despite its central location, the Inner Harbor always remained underdeveloped, and more than a little seedy.  In the 1960s, particularly after the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr that devastated the city, the Inner Harbor sunk into decline with the rest of the city, leaving the waterfront dominated by abandoned warehouses, deteriorating industrial buildings, and open grassy areas for the occasional festival. In 1980, in what was considered nothing but hopeless folly, Mayor DAlesandro Jr. came up with an expensive plan to revitalize the Inner Harbor, starting with the construction of the waterfront Harborplace, a big, attractive, indoor mall filled with shops and cafeteria dining. Shortly thereafter the city built the National Aquarium and Maryland Science Center, and lo and behold, the plan was a spectacular success, and the Inner Harbor took off and hasnt looked back.  Today, the Inner Harbor is the city centerpiece,  Maryland s number one tourist destination, and the single biggest economic boon for the city. The views across the harbor and its ships towards the old Domino Sugar Factory in the south and the skyscrapers, including the Maryland World Trade Center, in the north are the icons of the city. Restaurants and big hotels line the waterfront, and tourists fill the streets, promenade, and piers. The Inner Harbor is less popular with locals, however, so you would do well to get out a bit to other neighborhoods like  Fells Point  and  Midtown  to get a better feel for the local culture!</field>

		<field name="content">Incorporated on March 6, 1759, Johnston was named for the colonial attorney general, August Johnston.  The city is approximately 24 square miles with less than one square mile of water.  Home to the only  landfill in Rhode Island, the town is not the top of mind for visitors, whether they come from a distance or are Rhode Islanders.  There is much more to Johnston than meets the eye. The town has the highest population of Italians in the State of Rhode Island.   The town is struggling in recent months with the Central Landfill over disturbing odors which have gone unresolved since early summer of 2011.  While not constant or consistent across different areas of the town, visitors should be advised of the issue and check current updates before visiting.     Johnston is part of the Providence- Fall River- Warwick metropolitan statistical area (MSA).  It is located in the Providence county area, and is four miles North West of Cranston, Rhode Island, and 43 miles South West of Boston, Massachusetts.  The population of Johnston is about 28,195 people.  Johnston was originally part of Providence, but in 1758 it was separated.  Johnston became incorporated on March 6, 1759, and was named after August Johnston, the colonial attorney general.  The town held it’s first official town meeting on April 18, 1759 at the home of Benjamin Belknap, in order to elect new officers.  As of July 2009 the average population of Johnston was 28,613.  The average male population was 13,409 (46.9%) and the average female population was 15,204 (53.1%).  The median age of all residents is about 40.7 years old.  The average household income in Johnston is about $56,394.   Johnston is very famous for it’s landfill.  The landfill is the only one in the state of Rhode Island and is often subject to many issues such as over capacity or a strong smell.  Although the Landfill seems like it is not something you would not want to see, it is definitely a worthwhile trip.  All of the machinery used to process the disposed waste is available for viewing.  It is quite interesting to see the process that has to be done in order to get rid of the whole state of Rhode Island’s trash!</field>

		<field name="content">Jamestown was founded in 1848 within a few months after gold was discovered in Woods Creek, a mile south of town. This discovery was itself within a few months after the original discovery of gold in Coloma, upstream from Sacramento on the American River at John Sutters sawmill, that initiated the California Gold Rush. In the earliest years, the American miners continued to mine near Jamestown, while miners from Mexico moved a few miles up Woods Creek to what has now become known as the city of Sonora.  Jamestown fell on hard times after the Gold Rush, but had a resurgence in the 1880s and 90s because many underground quartz mines were nearby. In 1897, a steam railroad was built, running at first from Oakdale to Jamestown, and later to Sonora and Tuolumne City, that was headquartered in Jamestown and further contributed to the towns economic prospects.</field>

But since the city was first settled, the river has changed its course and left behind an oxbow lake. Oxbow lakes are know for their semi-circular or crescent shapes, and they occur when one curve in the river is cut off from the main channel and becomes sealed of from it, creating a lake.  Over the years, New Roads has become one of the most visited small towns in the state, and several tourists return after their first trip.</field>

For over four decades in the late 1800s, the Island belonged exclusively to the renowned Jekyll Island Club - the winter retreat for some of the most elite families in America. The Morgans, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and several other families, reputed to hold over one-sixth of the worlds wealth, established the Jekyll Island Club and built a group of large cottages along Jekyll Creek. Jekyll Island was sold to the state in 1947, five years after The Club closed.  It is now one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the southeastern United States, and with over five miles of beaches and an unlimited number of outdoor activities, one of Georgias most popular vacation destinations.</field>

No direct access to the Arctic Ocean, which is 10 miles (16 km) away, exists from Deadhorse.

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">About 60,000 people live in this town that survived an economic downturn when the logging industry ended at the turn of the 20th century.  As with many Michigan cities, it is currently struggling to adapt to the challenges of having an economy based on the automotive industry. A recent article on AOL listed Saginaw in the Top 10 of Ghost Towns of the Future, due to its declining population, vacant downtown area, and lack of services  Over the past 15 years, Saginaw has built an impressive network of health care facilities - hospitals, specialists, cancer treatment centers - that serves residents from many of the surrounding counties.  Saginaw is a town with very high rates of violent crime and gang activity. While locals have been known to exaggerate the threat, the potential for violent crime is real. Visitors unfamiliar with the area would be wise to avoid residential neighborhoods in the city of Saginaw, especially east of the river and particularly at night. Downtown Saginaw can also get a bit rough, especially late at night when the bars clear out. That being said, if you exercise common sense and dont go looking for trouble, youll be fine.</field>

		<field name="title">Palos Verdes</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Palos Verdes Peninsula was originally part of enormous ranchos owned by Dominguez and Sepulveda.  "Palos Verdes" is a Spanish phrase that roughly means "green stalks" or "green wood".  A New York investment syndicate led by banker Frank Vanderlip bought the entire Peninsula sight unseen from George Bixby reportedly for $1.5 to $2 million (the price of a single average home today).  For Vanderlip, a man with vision and money, such an enormous piece of undeveloped land along the Pacific, so close to Los Angeles, must have been a "no-brainer".  Development began in the Malaga Cove area in the 1920s.  Vanderlip hired the famous Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm (sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Manhattans Central Park), to help design and plan the communities.  To this day all of the Palos Verdes towns have very strong architecture and development committees that tightly regulate building.  The cities collective efforts have been exceptionally effective in preserving open space and avoiding overdevelopment.  The Palos Verdes Peninsula is made up of four municipalities. Rolling Hills is a private, gated community restricted to residents and guests that, because of its location at the top the hills of the Peninsula, enjoys spectacular ocean and city views. Surrounding it is Rolling Hills Estates, a city of 8,000 residents known for preserving its unique rural environment and laced with more than 25 miles of equestrian trails. Along the coast is Rancho Palos Verdes, known for spectacular ocean views of the South Bay and  Catalina Island , and Palos Verdes Estates, which has the ambiance of a Mediterranean town, with clay tile roofed villas enjoying spectacular ocean and city views. The city streets are sometimes blocked by flocks of beautiful wild peacocks that inhabit the hillsides.</field>

		<field name="content">Lets be clear, if you are looking for the "real Alaska" this is not it, but you can see it from there. Anchorage is a city. A real city with traffic and giant malls and tall buildings and crime and most other things one expects to find in an American city. It is an important hub and the gateway to other areas including the Alaskan Interior and the Kenai Peninsula, but is not really a "tourist destination" unto itself. While it is not the political capitol of Alaska it is the economic capitol. There are good places to eat and plenty of shopping, but the city itself is just that, a city. A great place to gear up for a trip, but its not particularly "Alaskan" except for the weather. (in fact it is sometimes derisively referred to as "Los Anchorage" because it is so large and out of character with the rest of the state)</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">These days, Boulder wears several hats: as a university town, home of the University of Colorado at Boulder    and others; as a hi-tech town that is rapidly spawning bedroom communities in outlying farm towns; and as a center of alternate culture, with various new age institutions, Naropa University   , meditation centers, Buddhist centers, and the like.  What perhaps distinguishes it most from other cities of similar size in the United States, however, is its status as a mecca for serious athletes, many of whom have made their home here for the conditioning advantages of high altitude, combined with businesses, facilities, and a community that provides opportunities for serious training and competition. Even the average nine-to-five Boulderite is much more likely than the average American to be a serious climber, cyclist, runner, skier, etc., and you will see the difference as youre about town.  Boulder is situated in the  Front Range  region of Colorado and is virtually contiguous with  Denver , except for its buffer of Open Space Parks    which border the city and provide it shelter from its growing surroundings.  This reflects that it is the "front door" to the mountainous country to the west, with many outdoor attractions, including a medium sized ski resort less than an hour from the city limits, and also the fact that there are significant cultural differences between Boulder and Denver beyond its liberal politics.  Boulder is known for its outdoors and the residents with one of the healthiest lifestyles in America. It is very true, no matter what the weather, there are always people outdoors; running, biking, walking, hiking. It has a great atmosphere and beautiful sights.  Living in Boulder is very expensive. Along with being one of the most active towns in America, it is right up there with the living expense. Smaller towns are popping up around Boulder that are cheaper, but may take 10-15 minutes to get into this vibrant town.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Once a remote area, Kitty Hawk has grown into a summer resort area and provides some of the best beach recreation on the North Carolina Coast  The beach and village consist of low to medium density, single-family residential developments served by small businesses. Both the beach and the village share a feeling that development remains on a human scale and in harmony with nature. It is a pattern and character of development that the Towns people, both year-round and seasonal, are quite comfortable with and want to retain.  When Orville Wright stepped ashore in Kitty Hawk Village in the fall of 1900, he probably already knew that he and his brother were destined to make history as discoverers of flight. After all, they had chosen this remote fishing village on the Outer Banks partly for privacy from prying eyes.  Three years later, they would indeed break the bonds of earth for the first time in their heavier than air flying machine. From that moment forward, Kitty Hawk would forever be associated with the Wright Brothers as the birthplace of aviation -although the actual flight took place four miles south from the base of Kill Devil Hill.   Today, the once-tiny soundside village is one of the largest townships on the Outer Banks. On the oceanside, thousands of rental homes, restaurants and shops are part of the development that has characterized the northern Outer Banks from Nags Head to Corolla.   But along the Albemarle Sound, the village remains a treat for those who to choose to take a drive off the beaten path. Shaded lanes wind along the marshes. Quaint clapboard cottages and fishing boats line a series of canals that lead to the open waters of the Sound. And life takes on a more leisurely pace that is reminiscent of the way Outer Bankers used to live.  In 1903, Orville Wright telegraphed home the triumphant news of the first powered flight. The telegraph was dispatched from Kitty Hawk. This, along with the isolation of the area and the unusual names themselves, led to the subsequent confusion as to where the first flight actually occurred.  Wright Brothers National Memorial and Visitor Center and the Memorial Pylon are nearby reminders of the days when Orville and Wilbur Wright made this area their headquarters.</field>

However, many tourists frequently call Panama City Beach, Panama City.  Panama City Beach is home to the beaches of the area and is a hugely popular destination for spring breakers and families alike.  Panama City, is much different being the more established city in Bay County, and is therefore seen as the governmental, cultural, business, and educational capitol of the county.  It is also important to note that Panama City along with the western portions of the Florida Panhandle are located in the Central Time Zone.  This is unlike the rest of the state being in the Eastern Time Zone.</field>

Royal Governor William Tryon made New Bern the colonial capital. His restored 18th-century capitol and residence, Tryon Palace, dominates a thirteen-acre garden complex that includes several historical landmarks in the heart of the city. A major port and trading center in the 1800s, New Bern was captured and occupied by the Union Army after a fierce battle on March 14, 1862. New Bern has three historic districts with homes, stores, and churches dating as far back as the early 18th century. In 1898, the pharmacist Caleb Bradham invented Pepsi Cola in his pharmacy at the intersection Middle and Pollock Street. The building still exists.</field>

		<field name="content">The area from  Joplin , Missouri through  Galena , Riverton and Baxter Springs, Kansas to Picher, Oklahoma was lead and zinc mining country, extracting galena (lead sulphide) ore until the 1960s. The closure of the mines, followed by the bypassing of US Route 66 by Interstate highways, led to a decline in the local economy and a drop in local population.  As mining was never permitted within the Baxter Springs city limits, the town escaped the ecological damage which turned nearby Picher into a ghost town. The original motels and campgrounds which served motorists on the dozen miles of US Route 66 in Kansas are now gone, but portions of the citys Route 66 legacy live on to attract visitors today.</field>

Greenville County is both the most populous and most dense in the state at 407,383, but because its city limits enclose less than 30 square miles, the population of the city proper is 56,002 (2000 U.S. Census).

Elevated sidewalks and streets connected most of the buildings. Raymond claimed a population of 6,000 in the year 1913 and had a reputation as a wild and wooly lumber mill town. City fathers resisted the unwanted reputation with promotions of Raymond as "The Empire City of Willapa Harbor" and "The City That Does Things".

Most restaurants close after business hours, but there have been some efforts lately to encourage more activity.  If you visit downtown during the day, dont be surprised to see fewer people on the street than a typical city. Most people use an underground walkway system that connects many buildings and food courts.  Just north of the core of downtown, across the Buffalo Bayou, is a warehouse district that has somewhat recently attracted unique music venues, artists, and Oxheart, a popular upscale restaurant. Houstons biggest brewery, St. Arnolds, lies just a mile from the UH-Downtown rail station, but the journey requires crossing a freeway and walking through a sleepy industrial area.</field>

The Tennessee River was dammed to make  Kentucky Lake  and the Cumberland River to make  Lake Barkley . A canal between the two lakes was dug at Grand Rivers, creating an inland peninsula.  The federal government purchased all of the land between the lakes to create Land Between The Lakes (LBL), a 170,000-acre national recreation area.  Land Between the Lakes offers all the outdoor recreation “basics” with opportunities for environmental and historic interpretation.  Experience the environment through hands-on excitement at LBL. LBL has many hiking and biking trails, horseback riding, an off-road vehicle area, camping, drag boat racing and much more.  Grand Rivers is the only community that fronts on both  Kentucky Lake  and  Lake Barkley . Water recreation is nearly limitless in this area and so is camping, hiking, biking and other outdoor recreation.</field>

The Wissahickon Creek runs to the east of the two avenues, and is flanked by the Wissahickon section of Fairmount Park.  The park offers many paths and beautiful vistas, and is a popular, though not crowded, spot for runners or people who enjoy light hiking.  Roxborough: It is not certain where Roxborough received its name from, but it is likely that the original settlement was named after Roxburghshire, Scotland which is the original home of an early settler Andrew Robeson.  Roxborough has two main Avenues running almost parallel through it which connects the neighborhood to the rest of the city.  Roxborough connects to Manayunk through Ridge Ave and to East Falls by Henry Ave.  Most of Roxborough’s business is placed along Ridge Ave consisting of many hoagie shops and restaurants as well as regular shops and coffee shops.  Roxborough is connected to the city through a number of different modes of SEPTA transportation including the train and bus.  It is also easily accessed by driving.  The neighborhood lies on the edge of the city’s limits and is often mistaken as a suburb of Philadelphia.  It has one of the lowest crime rates within the city and because of the low crime rates along with the “suburban feel,”  easy access public transportation and community parks, Roxborough is a attractive place to live.  One of the main parks is called Valley Green.  It consists of one main path that runs along side of the Wissahickon Creek and stretches for about 15 miles.  Connected to this main path are numerous of smaller trails reaching all ends of the park.  Valley Green attracts many runners, walkers, bicyclists, and horseback riders.  Located along the path there is a restaurant called the Valley Green Inn.  The surrounding area of the restaurant, one can find a number of ducks to feed, which has become a popular activity.      Manayunk is known as the "city on a hill," home to many unique stores and shops as well as a thriving student and artist community.  The neighborhood is built on a hill up to Ridge Ave. Some very interesting, beautiful, and historic architecture lines the winding Green Lane up the hill, as well as many other roads in the neighborhood.  These beautiful rowhomes, townhomes, and single-family homes are home to everyone from working class laborers to middle class professionals, young adults, college students, and young families.  The same is true of the surrounding Roxborough neighborhood, which acts as the "suburbs" of Manayunk, though it, too, falls within the city limits.  Manayunks demographics and architecture are largely extended into Roxborough, although instead of the nightlife hotspot of Main St., Roxboroughs main thoroughfare is Ridge Ave, which is lined with shops, markets, and restaurants as well as convenience stores.  Manayunk also hosts an annual Arts Fest and the main climb for the Philadelphia International Cycling Championship in summer months. Main Street runs through the heart of this unique shopping and dining destination with over 70 chic boutiques and galleries and 30 restaurants and eateries.  It is also a popular nightlife destination for young adults. Flat Rock was the original name given to this section of the Schuylkill River, where rapids churned through the rocks in the section of the river, above the Wissahickon Creek. In 1824, a community meeting of the newly formed town changed the name to Manayunk, derived from the Lenape Amerindian word manaiung (place to drink). It was named a National Historic District in 1983.  East Falls is named for its eastern location to the falls across from the Wissahickon Transfer Center. It is home to Philadelphia University, Drexel University College of Medicine, and Womens Medical College (the first womens medical school in the world), which is currently being renovated into a mixed-used development by a team that includes Philadelphias own Wulff Architects. The end of Kelly Drive culminates at East Falls; take the bridge over the Schuylkill River to MLK Drive to continue your 8 mile bike ride back down to the Art Museum.  Ridge Ave. intersects Midvale Ave, in the heart of East Falls, where you can expect to find a mixture of markets, pizzerias, sports bars, and unique restaurants.  Beautiful and interesting architecture abound on the rowhomes and townhomes of Queen Lane, Indian Queen Lane, Penn St., and the surrounding blocks.  Travel up Midvale Ave. to see old world style rowhomes populated by middle and upper class professionals.  Take Vaux St towards Philadelphia University to find mansions and other old world and tutor style large homes that mix urban and suburban layouts on winding roads.  This neighborhood is also populated by wealthy Philadelphians, including Ed Rendell, governor of Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2011, and former US Senator Arlen Specter.   Mt. Airy is a residential neighborhood that could be described as eclectic, with its main streets crossing at the site of a natural food co-op. Young families tend to live here on many tree-lined streets. Mt. Airy is subdived into two areas, West Mt. Airy and East Mt. Airy, with Germantown Ave ("the Avenue") forming the border between the two. The Avenue (along with the rest of the neighborhood) is undergoing a renaissance, anchored by the popular North By Northwest restaurant/music venue. Characteristics of the neighborhood include some amazing architecture of all different styles and better-than-average public transit access. There are also some historical sites related to the Revolutionary Wars Battle of Germantown. It is a very liberal area, politically speaking, with a very diverse population.   Chestnut Hill is the next neighborhood west from Mt. Airy along Germantown Ave, Chestnut Hill is largely a leafy, quaint, residential neighborhood that has, historically, been associated with wealth. It boasts beautiful rowhomes as well as large homes on large properties and a few mansions.  The architecture is beautiful, including some famous buildings.  Germantown Ave. has the feeling of a quaint small town main road reminiscent of a New England, or even old England, town.  It has a bustling main st complete with restaurants, a hotel, a farmers market, bakeries, and plenty of stores and boutiques. It feels like a charming small town on the edge of the city.</field>

Irvine is spearheading the growth in Orange County where almost everything is either new or refurbished. Most of the growth in Irvine was sparked by the donation of a large parcel of land to the University of California system in order to establish the 4th largest UC Campus (in terms of attendance) - UC Irvine.  The city is becoming the de facto business center of Orange County with many national and international companies having a presence in Irvine. Most of Irvine bordering Newport Beach (and the airport) and the areas surrounding any freeways are commercial areas where most of the larger companies have their offices.  The city is best characterized as a perfectly planned suburbia, which it is. The arterial streets are very wide and have very generous speed limits. Most residential areas are off the arterial streets on smaller two lane residential streets that lead to housing communities.</field>

		<field name="title">Bellingham (Washington)</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The City of Bellingham (aka the City of Subdued Excitement) formed in 1903 when the cities of New Whatcom and Fairhaven consolidated from what were once four separate settlements (Fairhaven, Whatcom, Sehome, and Bellingham). It is the northernmost city in the contiguous 48 states. This is not widely known, as the state of  Maine  in the Northeast often appears to be further north on many maps.  The local economy got its start in resource extraction, notably coal and timber. The Georgia-Pacific mill on the waterfront, whose site is now being redeveloped    into a dynamic mixed-use neighborhood, sustained the local economy for many years. Recently employment has diversified from heavy industry to education, services, tourism, and retail. Bellingham is the seat of Whatcom County.  Situated on Bellingham Bay, you can venture from downtown and in minutes be in rural farmland, the North Cascades or out on the salt waters around the  San Juan Islands . Bellingham is situated about 80 miles North of  Seattle  and 55 miles South of  Vancouver , BC. Environmentally friendly practices such as recycling are part of the culture here. Bellingham is known for being a town that cares for its environment and its residents enjoy the many outdoor activities the region supports.   Outdoor adventure  has become a big part of the reasons why people live and visit here. From skiing at nearby Mt. Baker to whale watching near the San Juan Islands, the region offers many attractions. While the community is growing, it still retains much of its authentic self and commitment to its laid back, progressive style.   Downtown  thrives with a variety of locally owned businesses, fine dining and nightlife options. It is also the cultural core of the city, with an eclectic mix of museums and performance venues all within blocks of each other. The historic  Mt. Baker Theatre  hosts a variety of live performances year-round. The nearby  Whatcom Museum of History Art  showcases exhibitions of contemporary art and regional history in four buildings.   Down on Bay Street is the  American Museum of Radio and Electricity . It links the scientific exploration of the phenomenon called “electricity” with the development of radio into its Golden Age. Compelling, interactive exhibits spanning three centuries feature a world-class collection of unique electrical objects and radios.  Nearby on Commercial Street is the  Bellingham Railway Museum . This facility traces the history of the railway in Bellingham through a variety of hands-on exhibits and simulators. The Museums Lionel and tinplate exhibit features a collection of pre- and post-war Lionel, Marx and Ives toy trains and the accessories that went with them.       Western Washington University  attracts students from across the region to Bellingham. This keeps the city relatively young and vibrant, and contributes to an unusually rich local cultural scene. WWU is also home to one of the largest finest collections of  outdoor sculpture  on the West Coast, featuring works of internationally renowned artists including Richard Serra, Isamu Noguchi, Beverly Pepper and Anthony Caro.   Fairhaven is noted for its colorful, 19th century history. With hopes of being the next Chicago, Fairhaven bustled with hotels, taverns, an opera house, concert garden, restaurants and brothels. The boom, driven initially by demand for lumber, coal and fish, was further fueled by the rumor that Fairhaven was to become the western terminus of the second northern transcontinental railroad.   Today, several red brick relics of Fairhavens era survive in the federally designated historic districts six square-blocks. They (and other structures) are now home to a variety of unique local restaurants, pubs, art galleries, antique shops, bookstores, boutique hotel plus an inn and spa. The district has blossomed into a major destination and residential community.  As coffee is a way of life in the Northwest, the region certainly has its share of local espresso stands. Whatcom County holds the record for the most drive-up espresso stands per-capita in  Washington (state) . More than 50 stands dot the landscape, with such lively names as "Brewed Awakening", "I Wana Moka", "Jitters Cafe", "Shot in the Dark" and "Well Latte Dah".  Bellingham Whatcom County Tourism,    is the central resource for community information. 800-487-2032 toll free in US and Canada, 360-671-3990. They have an info center at Interstate 5, Exit 253 City Center. Open daily 8:30AM-5:30PM</field>

		<field name="title">Southern Maryland</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Until recently, Southern Marylands economy was fueled by tobacco and watermen. Both activities are now in steep decline. Oyster and fish stocks in the Chesapeake Bay have suffered dramatic declines over the last several decades, partly due to overfishing but largely caused by reduced water quality and introduced diseases and parasites. Efforts to improve the water quality of the Bay are ongoing but because the Bay watershed covers four states they are difficult to coordinate. The economy of the area is now largely governed by the heavy military presence, as the area is home to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, the Navys primary air-test facility, and Andrews Air Force Base, the home of Air Force One. Many residents commute to Washington DC or Annapolis.   Southern Maryland was the first area in Maryland settled by Europeans. Much of the area was explored by John Smith from Jamestown in the late 1500s. Originally a Catholic colony, many lovely 17th and 18th century Catholic and Episcopal churches can be found here. The area was the hiding place of John Wilkes Booth during much of the manhunt to find him after President Lincolns assassination, and the home of Doctor Samuel Mudd, who treated him during his escape.  Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney, infamously known as the Chief Justice who presided over the Dredd Scott decision, was from Calvert County. Other famous (or infamous) residents include author Tom Clancy (Huntingtown), and Socks, the First Cat during the Clinton Presidency (now, sadly, deceased) who lived with her owner, Clinton Secretary Bettie Curry, in Saint Marys County.  Geologically, southern Maryland has been shaped by the Chesapeake Bay which borders it on the east and by the two major rivers which pass through it: the Patuxent, and the Potomac, which forms its western boundary. The area is characterized by low, rolling hills (most of the area is less than fifty feet above sea level); flat fields; and very steep, narrow ravines due to the easily erodable nature of its sandy soil. Most of southern Maryland was underwater many times as sea levels rose and fell over the millennia. Consequently, fossils can be found in many places, especially along the banks of the Bay and the major rivers passing through the area, the Patuxent and the Potomac. The Calvert Cliffs are geologically unique. Occurring along the Calvert County portion of the Chesapeake Bay, these are clay cliffs that range in height from just a few feet to over thirty feet. In many spots, several layers of fossil strata are clearly visible, testament to the sea life that thrived here during periods of increased sea levels. The D-Day invasions were practiced here due to the cliffs similarity to those on the French coast. Southern Maryland is particularly known for its many different kind of fossilized sharks teeth, especially those of Megalodon, an extinct relative of the Great White Shark that grew up to 60 feet long and which was probably the largest shark that ever lived. Megalodon teeth can be up to six inches long.</field>

Despite the name, there are no apple orchards in the city.  Prior to World War II, the city was known for growing award winning apples.  The local apple crops were decimated by three devastating years of fungal infection and extreme weather in the mid 1940s.  Ironically, the Postal Service approved the name "Apple Valley" for the local post office in 1949, after destruction of most of the local orchards and the end of the commercial apple industry in the area.  Apple Valleys claim to fame is as the home and final resting place of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, stars of many western films and television shows from the 1930s to the 1950s.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">A business and residential district in the city of  Los Angeles , the core of Hollywood for a tourist is its three fascinating boulevards: Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, and Melrose Avenue. All three are worth seeing. Hollywood Blvd is known for its entertainment history; Sunset Blvd for its clubs and nightlife; and Melrose Ave for its shopping, nightlife, and eclecticism.  Hollywood was founded as an independent city in 1903 and voted to merge with the City of Los Angeles in 1910. That same year also saw the birth of the Southern California motion picture industry when D. W. Griffith relocated his Biograph Company, sparking a westward migration of East Coast filmmakers. As movies exploded in popularity in the 1910s and 20s, the name Hollywood became synonymous with "the Industry." In the decades following World War II, Hollywoods glitz and glamour began to fade as most of the leading film studios moved to other places.  The House Un-American Activities Committee combed through Hollywood in the late 1940s and 1950s and built its “Hollywood Blacklist,” which consisted of screenwriters, actors,  directors, musicians and other entertainment employees who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party. HUAC called on hundreds of “suspected” communists with in the industry to testify, many rolled over and named names, but some, like the “Hollywood Ten” refused to incriminate themselves in a crime they did not commit and were arrested. By 1952, the Hollywood Blacklist rejected over 300 people from working in the industry. It was not until the late 1950’s that the blacklist stopped terrorizing Hollywood.   In the 1980s, Hollywood was considered one of the worst neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The 1990s, however, saw the beginning of community redevelopment efforts, and today Hollywood is once again one of the regions most vibrant areas.  Paramount is the only major studio still headquartered in Hollywood, but the area nonetheless remains an important center of the entertainment industry with its myriad production and broadcast facilities. Other affiliated businesses include Sunset-Gower Studios, Hollywood Center Studios, Raleigh Studios, Jim Henson Studios (a subsidiary of Walt Disney Pictures), and KTLA Studios (the local CW affiliate, housed on the original Warner Bros. lot). The other major studios are located to the north in the  Universal City - Burbank  corridor (Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, ABC, NBC, and DreamWorks).  Most of the rest are to the west:  Century City  (Fox, MGM), the Fairfax District (CBS), and  Culver City  (Sony).  If you want to see where films are shot, take a tour at one of the major studios:  Universal  "bundles" a full amusement park with its tour, while several other studios offer smaller, but interesting tours.  In reality, most films are shot in warehouses and sound stages in  Burbank  and elsewhere.  If you want to see celebrities, pack your patience or be prepared to play the role of boulevardier. The chances of bumping into a celebrity are very low (mainly because most of the celebrities who live in Hollywood usually do not go out in public) unless youre willing to do a lot of "hanging out" at expensive restaurants in  Beverly Hills , on Sunset Plaza, or in  Malibu .  You can easily see where they live by taking a tour or buying a star map for about $10. (Do you remember Tatum ONeal in The Bad News Bears?) You might also try the Book Soup bookstore or the Viper Room bar, both on Sunset Blvd in  West Hollywood , or a number of other locations in the area where the stars live their day-to-day lives.</field>

		<field name="content">A major site in the days of the Texas Revolution, Gonzales is considered the "Birthplace of Texas Independence", as it is where the first shot for Texas independence was fired. Not as well known, and certainly not as publicized, as more major arenas in the Texas Revolution, such as the Alamo and San Jacinto, Gonzales is where the first combat of the Revolution took place. Today, however, it is a small town of roughly 6000 people, where time moves at a much slower pace. Similar to most other towns in this part of Texas, Gonzales is unique because of its heritage and the various sites and events that celebrate this heritage.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Harney County is situated in south eastern corner of Oregon.  Harney includes the furthermost northwestern tip of the Great Basin.  The county is geographically in the Pacific Northwest, although it represents little of what many people imagine the region to be like.  The western side of the Cascade Mountain Range is the part of the state that many people think of when speaking of Oregon; very wet, green, and lushish.  However, the Cascades create a very large block on clouds carrying precipitation, thus making the eastern side of the Cascades much drier and arid.  This further explains why Harney County is in the High Desert, that and the fact that much of the region is above 4000 to 5000 feet above sea level.  Harney County covers vast amounts of land from  Nevada  and halfway up to  Washington .  The county is one of the largest in the US, covering 10,228 square miles, an area that is larger than some East Coast states.  The geography of the county is very diverse, but a common trait is that it is very arid.  At the southern end of the county it is much like a desert, hence the name  High Desert .  Harney County cannot be thought of as just a region of desert and small shrubs, a large chunk of the county is covered by vast forests of Ponerosa Pine and Fir varities.  The logging industy was once a great source of revenue to the county but the large Edward Hines Mill has been shut down since the late 1980s.  Since the close of the mill Harney Countys population has been in steady deline.  Another leading industry that is still successful in Harney is the cattle ranching industry.  Harney covers thousands of square miles of rangeland that makes it ideal for grazing.    Actually Harney is strong in many different aspects of agriculture, from cattle and sheep to hay production and alfalfa growing.  All of the small rural communities are hubs for the agricultural communities that they are surrounded by.  In Harney it is not uncommon to have to drive an excess of 5 miles just to meet your neighboor.  Harney County brings a new view to the term wide open spaces.</field>

Being outside of the National Park, El Portal is not subject to strict Park limitations on development, so a number of large motels have been constructed.  Yosemite Valley is a 20 minute drive from El Portal along a relatively flat road, which makes El Portal convenient while providing cheaper lodging than the Park itself.  Visitors looking for even cheaper lodging could drive further to  Mariposa .  Those looking to save a might drive as far as  Merced , but this would be considered quite a distance for visiting Yosemite.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">What the locals call "the East Bay" is really two fairly distinct regions separated by the East Bay hills. On the bay side of the hills in the west, the cities of Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro and Hayward rise from the edge of the San Francisco Bay up the western face of the foothills. The climate tends to be temperate, the culture diverse and the traffic horrendous.  On the eastern side of the hills, the towns of Walnut Creek, Pleasanton and Livermore lie in the area known as the Tri-Valley region (named for the Livermore, San Ramon and Amador valleys). The climate here is more like that of the  San Joaquin Valley , with foggy winters and scorching summers. The population is more homogeneous, but the traffic is still pretty awful. Originally, when the small towns of the Tri-Valley area began to grow into immense suburbs in the 1970s, many people commuted over the hills to work in the South Bay, the Peninsula or the City. Today, many large corporations have offices in the Tri-Valley area, and the suburbs of Pleasanton and Walnut Creek are growing into small cities.   However, due to the population exodus from "The City" (due to $$$ high prices and low bang for the buck) and the movement of some families from the west side of the hills it is growing very rapidly and the traffic is now as terrible as any place in Northern California. As the locals would say "The traffic is like, um like, hella bad here"   Contra Costa County  in itself is divided into three parts simply referred to as: "West County" near Richmond, "Central County" for the booming area near Walnut Creek, Concord, and Mount Diablo, "East County" for the area near the Delta which includes Antioch or Brentwood.  The two main area codes are (510) for Western Alameda county and the "West County" region  of Contra Costa, and (925) for central and east  Contra Costa County  and for the central eastern part of Alameda county near the fairgrounds  Pleasanton  and  Livermore .   There are many malls and shopping centers in the east bay. Sunvalley Mall (Concord), Stoneridge Mall (Pleasanton), Bay Fair Mall, New Park Mall, Southland Mall, and Hilltop Mall are some of the largest.  There are three professional sports teams in Oakland: Oakland As (baseball), Oakland Raiders (football), and the Golden State Warriors (basketball).   The University of California Berkeley    is world renowned for its educational standards and its liberal viewpoint of most things. The California Bears Football team plays in ancient Memorial Stadium, which sits right over the Hayward Faultline. (Note: Memorial Stadium is currently undergoing major renovations and will reopen in 2012; all 2011 Cal home games are being played at ATT Park in San Francisco)   There is a Cal State school in Hayward (CSU East Bay    - formerly known as "CSU Hayward"). There are many two year junior colleges here but one of the biggest is Diablo Valley College   , located in Pleasant Hill, CA  Contra Costa County</field>

		<field name="content">Two national forests, the Inyo National Forest and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, as well as three wilderness areas, the Hoover Wilderness, Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness can be explored in Mono County.  Nearly all the two million acres in Mono County are government owned.  What isnt is ranchland for cattle and sheep or supports the countys largest industry... tourism.    Mono Lake, the largest natural lake entirely within California, attracts millions of migratory birds including 90 percent of the California Gull population to nest there.  Mono Lake is also downright bizarre, with surreal tufa columns that rise from the waters edge and a chemistry so unusual that NASA has run tests in its murky depths in order to determine whether life might exist on other planets.    Signs of geologic activity can be seen throughout Mono County... steaming hot springs, volcanic flows, obsidian domes, ancient craters, and open faults.  Theres even a geothermal power plant to tour by calling (760) 934-4893.    Mammoth Mountain (11,053 ft) in the town of Mammoth Lakes is one of the largest ski areas in the U.S. In summer, the ski runs become mountain biking trails at one of the most extreme mountain biking experiences in the U.S.  June Mountain, near the town of June Lake, is a favorite of snowboarders, families and backcountry skiers (yes, guided off-piste skiing is permitted there).  Cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ice-climbing, backcountry skiing, snowplay, dog sledding and snowmobiling are other popular winter activities.  Mono County is home to Californias legendary Alpers Trout, raised by local aquaculturist, Tim Alpers on the historic Conway Ranch.  These lunkers are prized for their beefy shape, massive size and fight.  Because so many "Alpers Trout" are stocked there and due to its clear water and many lakes and streams, anglers consider Mono County and the Eastern Sierra to be prime fly and bait fishing territory.  The region is so renowned for its fishing that field testing of many synthetic baits and lures occurs there.  Hiking, horseback riding and wilderness pack trips, backpacking, cycling, motor touring, off-roading, camping, orienteering, golfing, kayaking, water-skiing, jet-skiing, rock-climbing and bouldering are popular summer activities.  Bodie is Mono Countys most notorious town, yet only caretakers live there, today.  It was one of the wildest towns in the West in the late 1800s, but today is a ghost town managed by the California State Parks, as is the Tufa State Reserve at Mono Lake.  Californias finest displays of fall color can be found here.  From early September through October (usually peaking in early October), spectacular displays of yellow, orange, red, pink, auburn and green leaves descend from the high up in the Eastern Sierra, down canyons to near U.S. 395.</field>

While Crisfield is a lot less tourist-oriented than some of the charming small towns of the southern Eastern Shore—its a gritty port town and a little rough around the edges, its still a good visit for the authentic Chesapeake Bay culture (and is well combined with a day trip to  Smith Island  or  Tangier ), as well as some seafood dining, or the states famous National Hard Crab Derby.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Until 1905 the area was known as the Salton Basin.  In that year, an irrigation canal from the Colorado river broke, sending water flooding into the basin.  This flooding lasted a year and a half, and when it was done, the Salton Basin had become the Salton Sea.  In reality, the basin has been flooded countless times throughout its long history, and periodically dries out because it is in a desert that gets 3 inches of rain each year.  In the past the Salton Sea was a resort area, but changing water levels and the increasing salinity of the water resulted in decreased tourism and the collapse of the resort industry.  The majority of the business in the Salton Sea area is now agricultural.  Because of its southern latitude, elevation of 227 feet below sea level, and location in the Sonoran Desert, the area sees some of the hottest temperatures in the nation with daily temperatures from May to October often exceeding 100°F, and extreme temperatures higher than 115°F recorded yearly.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Chicagos skyline viewed from Millennium Park  Chicago was known as a fine place to find a wild onion if you were a member of the Potawatomi tribe, who lived in this area of  Illinois  before European settlers arrived. It was mostly swamps, prairie and mud long past the establishment of Fort Dearborn in 1803 and incorporation as a town in 1833. It could be argued that nature never intended for there to be a city here; brutal winters aside, it took civil engineering projects of unprecedented scale to establish working sewers, reverse the flow of the river to keep it out of the citys drinking supply, and stop buildings from sinking back into the swamps — and that was just the first few decades.  By 1871, the reckless growth of the city was a sight to behold, full of noise, Gothic lunacy, and bustling commerce. But on October 8, Mrs. OLearys cow reportedly knocked over a lantern in the crowded immigrant quarters in the West Side, and the Great Chicago Fire began. It quickly spread through the dry prairie, killing 300 and destroying virtually the entire city. The stone Water Tower in the  Near North  is the most famous surviving structure. But the city seized this destruction as an opportunity to rebuild bigger than before, giving canvas for several architects and urban planners who would go on to become legends of modern architecture.  At the pinnacle of its rebirth and the height of its newfound powers, Chicago was known as The White City. Cultures from around the world were summoned to the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition, to bear witness to the work of Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, and the future itself. Cream of Wheat, soft drinks, street lights and safe electricity, the fax machine, and the Ferris Wheel bespoke the colossus now resident on the shores of Lake Michigan.  As every road had once led to Rome, every train led to Chicago. Carl Sandburg called Chicago the Hog Butcher for the World for its cattle stockyards and place on the nations dinner plate. Sandburg also called it the City of the Big Shoulders, noting the tall buildings in the birthplace of the skyscraper — and the citys "lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning." But Chicago is a city in no short supply of nicknames. Fred Fishers 1922 song (best known in Frank Sinatras rendition) calls it That Toddlin Town, where "on State Street, that great street, they do things they dont do on Broadway." Its also referenced by countless blues standards like Sweet Home Chicago.  Chicago is also known as The Second City, which refers to its rebuilding after the fire — the current city is literally the second Chicago, after the one that disappeared in 1871. The moniker has stuck, in no small part due to its popular association with the citys long-held former position as the United States second largest city. And many know the nickname from Chicagos great comedy theater in  Old Town .  Chicagos history with corruption is legendary. During the Prohibition era, Chicagos criminal world, emblemized by names like Al Capone, Baby Face Nelson, and later Sam Giancana, practically ran the city. The local political world had scarcely more legitimacy in a town where voter turnout was highest among the dead and their pets, and precinct captains spread the word to "vote early, vote often." Even Sandburg acknowledged the relentless current of vice that ran under the surface of the optimistic city.  Today, Chicago is known as The Windy City. Walking around town, you might suspect that Chicago got this nickname from the winds off Lake Michigan, which shove through the downtown corridors with intense force. But the true origin of the saying comes from politics. Some say it may have been coined by rivals like  Cincinnati  and  New York  as a derogatory reference to the Chicagoan habit of rabid boosterism and endless political conventions. Others say that the term originated from the fact that Chicago politicians change their minds "as often as the wind."  Finally, the city is known as The City That Works, as promoted by longtime Mayor Richard M. Daley, which refers to Chicagos labor tradition, the long hours worked by its residents, and its willingness to tackle grand civic projects. Daley and his father, former Mayor Richard J. Daley, ruled the city for decades in what can only be described as a benevolent dictatorship; as other Midwestern manufacturing cities like  Cleveland  and  Detroit  went into decline, Chicago thrived, transforming from a city of stockyards and factories to a financial giant at the forefront of modern urban design. Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel became mayor of Chicago in 2011.  While the city has many great attractions downtown, most Chicagoans live and play outside of the central business district. To understand Chicago, travelers must venture away from the Loop and Michigan Avenue and out into the vibrant neighborhoods, to soak up the local nightlife, sample the wide range of fantastic dining, and see the sights Chicagoans alone know and love — thanks to the citys massive public transit system, every part of Chicago is only slightly off the most beaten path.</field>

Early French and Spanish explorers came to the area in the 17th century, and by the early 19th century smugglers used the future site of Corpus Christi as a staging point for moving contraband into  Mexico .  Corpus Christi is located south of the Nueces River, and so it was in disputed territory during the Mexican-American War.  General Zachary Taylor camped in Corpus Christi for nine months as they established the Rio Grande as the southern border of the United States.  During the American Civil War, the city was bombarded by Federal gunboats.  Visitors hoping to see remnants of Old Corpus Christi in their original locations might be a little disappointed, as much of the city was destroyed by the 1919 hurricane; however, some restored historical buildings survive in downtown.</field>

With nearly double the people, farms and pieces of land have been sold and commercialized with creation of strip malls and multiple shopping plazas. Although Shrewsbury is part of the York metropolitan area, most commuters travel south to  Baltimore County  for work. Sixty-five percent of Shrewsbury residents are married or have families, with a median family income of about $57,000 per year. The majority of citizens in Shrewsbury claim to be registered Republicans, and demographically, the town is 97 percent white.</field>

		<field name="content">Settled in the 1730s by volunteers serving in the militia, it was originally called Volunteers Town.  Petershams town common, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is one of the finest in Massachusetts.  Approximately 45 buildings are included in the historic district, including the old Nichewaug Inn, the Petersham Memorial Library and the Petersham Country Store.  One of the most attractive features bringing travelers to Petersham is its wealth of conservation land.  Bordering the Quabbin Reservoir, thousands of acres are under MDC control.  The Quabbin Reservoir, created in the late 1920s and 1930s, is often called the "Accidental Wilderness" and home to a variety of wildlife including bald eagles.  The town is home to Harvard Universitys School of Forestry with the small but wonderful Fisher Museum, and an additional 3300 acres of conservation land owned by the university, and containing lovely hiking trails.  Then there are the Trustees of Reservation properties, including the North Common Meadow, the Swift River Reservation and the James W. Brooks Woodland Preserve totaling over 1000 additional acres of conservation land right in Petersham.  The Trustees own an additional eight properties within a 30 minute drive of Petersham.</field>

That hill, which has produced over two billion dollars worth of gold, silver, copper and zinc is literally honeycombed with drifts, winzes and stopes that extend beneath the city.  There are over 3000 miles of workings and shafts reach a depth of 4000 feet.  This immediate country was opened as a placer district in 1864.  Later Butte became a quartz mining camp and successively opened silver, copper and zinc deposits.  Butte has a most cosmopolitan population derived from the four corners of the world.

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Settled in 1623, as Strawbery Banke, Portsmouth is a historic seaport that boasts an intriguing mix of the old and the new. As one of the oldest cities in the US, it was founded just three years after the settlement at  Plymouth  MA, the city has a walkable scale that is more often seen in European villages than in US cities.   The city sits 2 miles inland from the sea, on the safe deep harbor waters of the Piscataqua river.  Its history as a seaport is an integral part of understanding Portsmouth today and yesterday. The city once was home to the founder of the US Navy, John Paul Jones, whose historic house still stands and is open to the public.   It continues to be home to the Portsmouth Shipyard, where the the HMS Falkland was built in 1690 for the British Navy and continues today, more then three centuries later, as a Navy shipyard that repairs and upgrades Los Angeles class nuclear submarines.   Today, the citys economy is a mix of the traditional with tugboats pulling in large ships to haul scrap material, fishman still plying the waters from Pierce Island, and new economy jobs in software and biotech at Lonza Biologics which is now one of the areas largest employers.  It is also the center of a growing metropolitian region, often called, "The Seacoast," that is home to 125,000 and includes the coastal towns of  Rye ,  Hampton , and  Newcastle  in New Hampshire and  Kittery  and  York  in Maine, as well as the inland cities of of  Rochester  and  Dover , NH. This region is known for its high quality of life and ranks as the 16th safest region in the  United States  according to Morgan Quitnos 2003 report.  Although the city has attracted an influx of newer residents who have come for the small town with big city amenities in the midst of an area of great natural beauty, the city still retains a good measure of stubborn independent spirit. If you doubt this, pick up a copy of the local weekly newspaper, the New Hampshire Gazette, which is free around town and take in the local view.  Today, you will still find an old styled barbershop as well as upscale coffee shops, a shop selling handmade gourmet chocolates across from a cooperative art gallery, and a slick seafood restaurant that could be in LA (the owners were from LA) next to place called the Friendly Toast that is decorated with 70s kitsch purchased on eBay.   In this friendly small town you will also find an easily digestible mix of small town vibe combined with cultural, dining, shopping, and nightlife variety that is usually only found in more urban settings. The downtown contains Strawberry Banke, a living history museum, Prescott Park a beautiful urban park, and a number of riverside bars and restaurants to while away the day. If you want to get away from downtown,  within a few miles are several ocean side parks that have facilities and beaches, often built around a historic fort, usually including a charming view of a lighthouse and sailboats.   To take maximum advantage, slow down and explore the city on foot. Take the time to linger a bit and talk to the locals walking their dog or the visitor relaxing at a sidewalk cafe. This is the best way to get a feel for the strong sense of place that has made Portsmouth a vibrant community both in the past and today.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The town of Long Branch is one of the largest cities on the  Jersey Shore . From the period of the 1860’s through the First World War, it was also the most glamorous.  Long Branch started out as a resort town, including such names as Astor, Fisk, Drexel – and even more notorious names such as Diamond Jim Brady and Lily Langtree. First Lady Mary Lincoln visited in 1861, but it was in 1869 that Long Branch NJ had it’s first presidential visit by President Grant. The President continued to visit every summer that he was president, and continued for many years after that.    In 1870, a racetrack opened, which is still a main attraction today and later on casinos began opening up.  After an attempt was made on James Garfield’s life, he was brought to Long Branch NJ in hopes of a recovery aided by the sea air. Indeed, a railroad spur from the main line to his house was built to make him more comfortable in his travels.  The 1920’s was witness to the beginning of Long Branch’s decline as a summer destination. Gambling laws stopped many of the rich and famous from visiting.  In addition storms eroded Long Branch’s beachfront. By the late 1960’s, organized crime settled in Long Branch NJ, further declining it’s image. Buildings and houses became run down, and many locals had to depend on welfare.  The St. James Episcopal Church built in 1879, is where all seven presidents worshipped and is all that is left of what structures were built during that period. It has since been renamed Church of the Presidents and is located at 1260 Ocean Avenue.  In recent years Long Branch is now enjoying an amazing second coming. Visitors how come to Long Branch, NJ will enjoy the beautiful beach front, the new boardwalk the was recently added, and Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park, a 33-acre county park with facilities for swimming, boating and picnicking.  High-rise condos have replaced the old summer bungalows, however some still remain. There is also a large selection of outstanding restaurants as well as a lively nightlife.  Pier Village is where most of the current rebuilding and most tourist attraction is aimed towards.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Salem is best known for the "Salem Witch trials" even though the hysteria really started in what is now  Danvers . Police cars are adorned with witch logos, a local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, the Salem High School athletic teams are named the Witches; and Gallows Hill, a site of numerous public hangings, is currently used as a playing field for various sports. Tourists know Salem as a mix of important historical sites, New Age and Wiccan boutiques, kitschy Halloween, witch-themed attractions and a vibrant downtown that a large number of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops. The 15th Annual Retailers Association of Massachusetts awarded Salem as the best place to shop in 2012  Home to Salem State University, the Salem Willows Park and the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem is a residential and tourist area which includes the neighborhoods of Salem Neck, The Point, South Salem and North Salem, Witchcraft Heights, Pickering Wharf, and the McIntire Historic District (named after Salems famous architect and carver, Samuel McIntire). Salem was one of the most significant seaports in early America and during the American Revolution, Salem became a center for privateering. Although the documentation is incomplete, about 1,700 Letters of Marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers and are credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.  By 1790, Salem had become the sixth largest city in the country, and a world-famous seaport—particularly in the China Trade, along with exporting codfish to Europe and the West Indies, importing sugar and molasses from the West Indies, tea from China, and products depicted on the city seal from the East Indies – in particular Sumatran pepper. Salem ships also visited Africa – Zanzibar in particular, Russia, Japan, and Australia.  The Old China Trade left a significant mark in two historic districts, Chestnut Street District, part of the Samuel McIntire Historic District containing 407 buildings, and the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, consisting of 12 historic structures and about 9 acres (36,000 m2) of land along the waterfront in Salem. Elias Hasket Derby was among the wealthiest and most celebrated of post-Revolutionary merchants in Salem, and owner of the Grand Turk, the first New England vessel to trade directly with China.  In 1637 the first muster was held on Salem Common, where for the first time a regiment of militia drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area, thus laying the foundation for what became the Army National Guard.  President Barack Obama signed into law on the 10th of January 2013 signed executive order HR1339 "which designates the City of Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the U.S. National Guard."  Each April, the Second Corps of Cadets gather in front of Saint. Peters Episcopal Church, where their founder, Stephen Abbott, is buried. They lay a wreath, play "Taps" and fire a 21-gun salute. In another annual commemoration, soldiers gather at Old Salem Armory to honor soldiers who were killed in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On April 14, 2012, Salem celebrated the 375th anniversary of the first muster on Salem Common with more than 1,000 troops taking part in ceremonies and a parade.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Uptown New Orleans was developed during the 19th century boom when New Orleans was one of the fastest growing cities in the United States.  The concentration and variety of intact 19th and early 20th century architecture make it a treat for those who enjoy the architecture of those eras, as well as a frequent setting for movie scenes.   Although predominantly residential, there is a wealth of local shops and restaurants -- many clustered along "neighborhood main streets", others scatted here and there.  The main streets of interest to visitors,  stretching in gentle curves reflecting that of the Mississippi River from one end of Uptown to the other, are St. Charles Avenue with its famous streetcar line, and Magazine Street a commercial hub with a bus line. Those visiting with a car or bicycle may also wish to check out Prytania Street, which parallels St. Charles a couple blocks closer to the river, competing with St. Charles for beautiful architecture along with a smattering of local businesses.  The parts of Uptown "back of town" (furthest from the river) near Claiborne Avenue experienced some flooding in the Federal levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina. For the most part it is still less thriving and of less interest to visitors. A notable exception is a section of  Freret Street  between Jefferson Avenue and Napoleon Avenue.  This circa 1900 neighborhood commercial street was in decline for a generation before it was flooded chest deep in 2005. By 2011, however it was one of the success stories of the New Orleans rebirth. While a few parts are still on the ragged side, the 8 block stretch of Freret is now hopping with new innovative local restaurants, shops, cafes, a comedy club, and a monthly market.</field>

Plainview and its neighboring town,  Old Bethpage , share their school system, library, fire department, and water district.   Plainviews history dates back to 1648, when land was purchased because it was considered desirable farming land. The remaining land was purchased in 1695 in a deal called the Bethpage Purchase. When the Long Island Railroad was built, Plainview had an increase in the farming market.  After World War II, many people were trying to leave New York for a more rural area. People moving out of the city resulted in many of the farmers in Plainview to sell their land. Massive development in the area began to take place and turned Plainview into the suburban town that it is now. The population jumped in size, making Plainview change from farmland to a functioning town.  Climate Plainview has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. Fall and Spring are the most comfortable seasons, with weather averaging in the 50s and 60. Winters can be harsh and temperatures usually drop down to the teens and sometimes even single digits. Plainview also gets a lot of snow, mostly in January and February. The summers are relatively warm, with weather in the 70s to low 90s.</field>

		<field name="content">Reno is at the western edge of the  Great Basin , a zone stretching to Salt Lake City that does not drain to the sea - water is carried away by evaporation only.  Average rainfall is approximately 7 inches a year, with much of that occurring in the winter in the form of snow.  July is the warmest month, with an average high of 91°F, and January is the coldest month, with an average low of 19°F.  Reno is in Northwestern Nevada, at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and serves as the urban center for a region including nearby Carson City and the Carson Valley, Lake Tahoe, Pyramid Lake, and historic mining town Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode.  Along with the city of Sparks, Reno is located in the Truckee Meadows, and together they form the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Area.  Competition in the last years of the 20th century slowed down the gambling business in Reno considerably.  Given that its downtown centered around these activities for a good 50 years, the same downtown suffered.  Downtown today has weathered the storm, and is improving with projects like a baseball and entertainment district and several condo projects that were completed despite economic slowdown.  Growth in the area has continued due to its livability.  Reno is working hard to build a different kind of city for a greater variety of tastes, and keeping that in mind will help the visitor see the town through the right kind of eyes.</field>

It is 110 miles (177 km) northeast of  Duluth  and 40 miles (64 km) southwest of the  Canadian  border along Highway 61, an All-American road and national Scenic Byway.  Fully half of the full-time residents of Cook County, Minnesota live in Grand Marais - thats about 1,300 people.  "Grand Marais" is from the French: "big swamp," to distinguish it from the town of Little Marais, which is about 60 miles (96 km) down the road and apparently was built on a smaller swamp.  This is apparently boosterism run amok, "You think you have it bad, we have it worse!"  Never fear, the town is no longer swampy.  Grand Marais offers a great deal to multiple kinds of visitors. Whether you are interested in getting into the outdoors, shopping while your husband fishes or getting a great bite to eat, there is a lot to be had in this small town.  Please keep in mind that many restaurants and shops are only open seasonally.  Call ahead or you may be disappointed.</field>

It is the seat of government for Oneida County and its largest city. The name Utica is a classical Roman name, like many names in Central New York. It is the Roman name of an ancient Phoenician settlement in North Africa, near  Carthage .   Settlement in Utica dates to the colonial area, as depicted in the novel and movie "Drums Along the Mohawk." Utica became an urban industrial center during the industrial revolution, particularly in textile production. Like most American industrial cities, Utica has suffered from population loss and urban decay since the 1970s. However, the popular conception that has made Utica the butt of jokes in TV shows like The Office and The Simpsons is an exaggeration. Contemporary Utica, in addition to its historical points of interest, is a multi-cultural city with a restaurant selection and local arts scene that are robust for a city of its size.</field>

Development moved west from the Schuylkill following the course of a network of trolleys (many of which still run today) and the El which runs above Market St. University City is also known as the "Left Bank" (an homage to Paris Latin Quarter), as well as Philadelphias "international" neighborhood because of the multitude of ethnicities living here.   Not surprisingly, West Philadelphia today presents a living catalog of 19th- and early 20th-century residential architecture ranging from dramatic ornate Queen Anne Victorian mansions to more humble brick rowhouses. Although many sections suffered decline and urban blight as the heavy industry that fed the demand for housing construction in West Philly dwindled and departed the United States, areas like Powelton Village, Spruce Hill and Cedar Park have been largely preserved and provide an opportunity to "step back into time" as you stroll the wide tree-lined streets of stately 19th-century homes. The area has been declared a National Historic District.  West Philly is home to several large educational institutions including the  University of Pennsylvania ,  Drexel University  and the  University of Sciences in Philadelphia .  The area also holds most of Philadelphias expansive Fairmount Park, the largest municipal park in the country. It is home to Mann Music Center, the Philadelphia Zoo, and soon the Please Touch childrens museum. On Sundays, MLK Drive is closed to traffic, so bring your Rollerblades!  Check out Clark Park on Baltimore Ave at 43rd Street, or take a stroll on Spruce or Pine.</field>

		<field name="content">Collinsville is a small city and is a suburb of St. Louis in the Metro East.  It is roughly in the middle of a string of towns extending from Edwardsville to Belleville. The city consists mainly of the original town on the river bluff and an expansion built up around I-70 at the base of the river bluffs.  This part has all/most of the major restaurant chains, hotels, and several "big box" stores.  You will also find the Gateway Conference Center    in this area.  Up on the bluff you will find the older part of the city.  It is largely a white, blue-collar midwestern town.  It has more of a small-town feel than a suburban feel.  The original downtown is called "uptown"    to differentiate it from the newer commercial area by I-70.  Although it was run-down for the past few decades, "uptown" is currently seeing a revitalization.  Collinsville is located at longitude 90W, making it one quarter of the way around the world from Greenwich.</field>

While the first Union Pacific Railroad tracks were laid in 1867, it wasnt until 1892 that the farmers and ranchers met to organize a town site company so they could have a post office and a railroad siding from which they could ship hay and potatoes.  The town was named in honor of one of the owners of the Paxton Hershey Land and Cattle Company, J.H. Hershey, originally from Pennsylvania. It wasnt until 1909 that Hershey was incorporated as a village.</field>

		<field name="content">Arkansas state motto is "The Natural State" and that tells you a lot. It has great state parks with wilderness comprising broadleaf forests. The northwest boasts the Ozark Mountains while the south and east of the state has flatter land and shows more of its agricultural heritage. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state and gives a great blues music heritage, great country music elsewhere (Johnny Cash was an Arkansan) and folk and bluegrass everywhere. There are wonderful state parks with camping facilities and some with cabins. The Buffalo River has majestic scenery and easy canoe float trips (but go in late spring to be sure there is enough water). The summer is HOT and humid; spring and autumn are wetter but mostly from intermittent heavy rain showers. Winter brings a little snow, but this time of year can still be humid. Spring is tornado season.  The spelling and pronunciation of "Arkansas" (it is always ar-kan-saw, with an emphasis on the saw, so it sounds like arc-an-saw, not ar-kansas) reflect the states heritage. The name is a French pronunciation of a Siouxan word meaning "land of downriver people" and was prescribed by law in 1881. It is technically still illegal to mispronounce the name (the law contains a clause stating that "the pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of a in man and the sounding of the terminal s is an innovation to be discouraged"), so be careful!</field>

		<field name="content">Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma, at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau, and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year, both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain. As a result, Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat, arid dust bowl. Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter, but it does not last long. The winters are considered to be very mild. There is not much snow, just a few inches each year, typically, although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large "ice storms". Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually.  In Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere. You will find the people of Tulsa love their city and they have that southern charm, so they are willing to help you find your way around. Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco in the nation, having been a booming city during the 1920s when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons who built stately mansions and turned the Downtown area into a treasure trove of art.</field>

Approximately 20.6 square miles, Bristol is a beautiful town right on the water that was founded by Roger Williams in 1636, and was named after Bristol, England. The town was eventually sold after 1685 and sold to four Boston investors: Byfield, Wally, Oliver and Burton, three of which when on to have schools named after them. By the late 1700s Bristol was a major ward for the illegal slave trade and inhabited some of the richest men in the country. One famous family who participated in the slave trade were the DeWolf Colts. The family’s most famous home was Linden Place Mansion, which inhabits in Bristol. Colt School was also built and donated to the town located next door to Linden Place and is made largely from marble and was built as a memorial to Theodore DeWolf Colt by her son. Colt Farm and Colt State Park are two other donations that live on through the family. Bristol, Rhode Island also holds the first, longest and largest Independence Day Parade in the country. The streets are lined with a red, white and blue stripe down the middle, year round and there are concerts leading up to the holiday three weeks in advance. There is a carnival week of, fireworks by the downtown water, a performance by the Navy Band and of course, the annual Fourth of July Parade.</field>

		<field name="content">King Arthur Faire (1999-2006)  Stroud was a popular rest stop on the famous US Route 66, the once-busy truck and passenger route from  Chicago  to  Santa Monica . In the 1950s many restaurants never closed, serving interstate travellers day and night. The section of 66 between Tulsa and Oklahoma City was one of the first to be bypassed by new four-lane Interstate highways.   As the Turner Turnpike (I-44) is a toll road, Oklahoma 66 remains as a free alternate.  Strouds major claim to fame was a Tangier Factory Outlet Mall which was destroyed (along with many key local employers) during a series of tornadoes on May 3rd, 1999. It was never rebuilt; the towns recovery was slow and arduous. In 2001, while local rebuilding efforts were ongoing, Pixar crews were led by Route 66 historian Michael Wallis on a five-state tour through  Baxter Springs  (Kansas),  Peach Springs  (Arizona) and countless towns between as research which inspired the nominally-fictional Radiator Springs for 2006 animated film "Cars". In Stroud they were inspired by Dawn Welch and her stubborn efforts to restore the 1939 fieldstone Rock Café, now listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.  From 1999 to 2006, Stroud hosted the King Arthur Faire, an annual renaissance fair. More recently, Stroud has benefited from the growth of oil and gas industries; Service King, a manufacturer of oilfield workover rigs, is now a major local employer. Plans are underway to build the new Sac and Fox Casino on the former outlet mall site and several wineries have been established in Stroud.</field>

		<field name="content">The history of Bessemer City starts around 1754, when James Ormand was granted land in this area by King George II of England and established his Ormand Mining Company there. Although today theres still mining activity around Bessemer City, several of the old iron ore mines are abandoned but around still. The Old Ormand Furnace is considered the oldest stack of its kind in the USA. Stories have it that the furnace was built to produce cannon balls for the Revolutionary War, but the exact history is unclear. Now, its a picnic ground.  In 1846 the area became part of Gaston County and almost 50 years later, in 1893, Bessemer City was finally chartered as a city. Still a small agricultural settlement then, the town quickly grew. Cotton mills prospered and by the year 1900 the population had grown to over 500 people. In town youll still find the Highacre houst, built in the early 1900s by one of the official founders of the city, Askew Smith.</field>

It is home to many world-class museums, art galleries, and theaters. Many of the worlds largest corporations have their headquarters here. The headquarters of the United Nations is in New York and most countries have a consulate here.  This citys influence on the globe, and all its inhabitants, is hard to overstate, as decisions made within its boundaries often have impacts and ramifications across the world.   Immigrants (and their descendants) from over 180 countries live here, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Travelers are attracted to New York City for its culture, energy and cosmopolitanism. English is the primary language spoken by most New Yorkers although in many communities it is common to hear other languages that are generally widely understood. In many neighborhoods, there is a large Latino/Hispanic population, and many New Yorkers speak Spanish. There are also many neighborhoods throughout the city that have a high concentration of Chinese immigrants where Mandarin or Cantonese may be useful. In some of these neighborhoods, some locals may not speak very good English, but store owners and those who would deal frequently with tourists or visitors all will speak English.</field>

		<field name="content">Oahu is truly at the heart of Hawaii. The city of  Honolulu  is busy, and its  Waikiki  district even more so. Oahu is home to the only real metropolitan area in all the Hawaiian Islands. For some, this has been both a blessing and a curse for the island.    On the plus side, visitors to Oahu and local Hawaiian residents themselves share in all the amenities and conveniences that only a large city such as Honolulu can provide—days spent dashing about, bustling nightlife, great restaurants, exciting cultural events and establishments, good public transportation, and a variety of shopping and lodging options. Combine this with the city and islands extensive beaches, parks, mountains, recreational areas, and quaint towns and this makes one enjoyable metropolitan area. On the minus side, Honolulu is a big city and has all the big city problems that come along with it, such as traffic, high cost of living, and some crime.  Honolulu may not embody the vision that some visitors have of Hawaii after looking at so many postcards: serenity and relaxation. True, one can relax on Oahu just by going to the right destinations on the island, you just need to know where to look. A calming oasis can be found as there are many resorts located outside of Waikiki that offer less crowded surroundings. Natural beauty can be found in the two mountain ranges, the Koolau and Waianae ranges. Some great hikes are just a short drive into the mountains from Waikiki. Secluded white sand beaches, funky beach towns, pounding winter surf on the North Shore. All of which can be found in other parts of Oahu.  So enjoy Honolulu and all it has to offer. But if you dont see the North Shore during the wintertime when monstrous waves pound the shore (think of the opening scene of the 1970s show Hawaii Five-O), then you have really missed something. Brave and experienced surfers attack these waves! If you dont take a drive through miles of pineapple fields, and if you dont take time to visit some of the white sand beaches, mountain trails, and scenery outside of Waikiki, then you really havent seen all Oahu has to offer.</field>

Its more than just museums, though, including the neighborhoods of Franklintown, Spring Garden, Fairmount, and sometimes Francisville. Though it is the seat of one the finest art collections in the world (you must see the Impressionist gallery), it also encompasses the Philadelphia Free Library, the Franklin Institute, the Wine School, the Eastern State Penitentiary (where Al Capone sat idle for many years), and an up and coming residential neighborhood that includes galleries, restaurants, and bars just east of the Parkway off of Spring Garden Street and Fairmount Ave. Kelly Drive, the most popular recreational destination in the city with bike and running paths, as well as historic Boathouse Row, begins just behind the art museum.  Northern Liberties, so named because it was free from the onerous regulations and taxes of Philadelphia, it has become a trendy neighborhood in Philadelphia among students, young professionals and artists is also home to many galleries and shops. NoLib, as its residents call it, is home to artist lofts, architecturally-conscious condo developments, and entertainment from bowling, to restaurants.  The Northern Liberties neighborhood extends approximately from Front Street to 6th Street east-west, and from Spring Garden Street to Girard Avenue north-south. Until about the 1960s, Northern Liberties was home to Philadelphias breweries: Ortleibs, Schmidts, and Ballantine. These beers are tougher to find these days, but live on at Citizens Bank Parks (home of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team) Brewerytown stand. It fell into a disrepair once the breweries declined.   Today Northern Liberties is an excellent place to spend an evening out, with a large number of unique bars and restaurants well within walking distance.  Fishtown, originally part of the Kensington neighborhood, is rumored to have gotten its name from Charles Dickens from the fish smell (its on the river). Its also believed that Penn Treaty park is where William Penn actually met with Native Americans. Many artists moved there after Northern Liberties became too expensive. There is an increasing among of galleries, a live music club (Johnny Brendas), and a somewhat burgeoning commercial strip along Girard Ave east of Front St. Its mainly a rowhouse neighborhood rather than one of lofts, a nice park here is Palmer Park.   Templetown is a neighborhood of Temple Universitys main campus, one mile north of City Hall and east of Fishtown. Not many locals actually call it "Templetown", but prefer to call it near Temple.</field>

Named for the austere and dramatic stone palisades of Mesa Verde Sandstone and Mancos Shale north of town, this sleepy farming community is surrounded by mesas of all shapes and sizes. Looming in front of the town are the dun-colored bluffs of the Bookcliffs, also known as the Palisades. The Bookcliffs form many different pillars, boulders and hoodoos that balance in seemingly impossible positions along Interstate 70.   Palisade is peach country, home to the eponymous Palisade Peach. Over 75 percent of Colorados wine grapes come from Palisade, and the town is home to over a dozen wineries. Most visitors come in the summer months, or early fall when the grapes are being harvested.  The best times to visit Palisade are May, June or September. The weather is mild and there are an abundance of outdoor activities to enjoy. The town is probably best known for its three  big festivals, Palisade Bluegrass and Roots Festival   , Palisade Peach Fest   , and Colorado Mountain Wine Fest   .  There is an informal, rustic charm to this small town. Historic Victorian gingerbread houses line the road into town, while Main Street offers a "Norman Rockwell" setting. Most of the inhabitants know each other by first name. Travelers can experience this camaraderie first hand at the summer farmers market, held downtown on the weekends. The market features local musicians, artists and fresh produce.   The changing seasons bring something different for visitors to enjoy. The fruit trees blossom in the early spring, the grapes hang heavy on the vines at harvest time, while the grape leaves turn red and orange in late fall.   Palisade is the perfect coda to the more frenetic and higher-priced ski resorts of  Aspen  or  Vail . Visitors can relax on the front porch of a local inn or bed and breakfast, sip fine wine and enjoy the scenery, all without breaking their budgets.</field>

		<field name="content">This is the center of Cherokee culture in North Carolina (and indeed the eastern  United States ). Many natives call this area home, the Cherokee language is also spoken by many in this area. The town was established by the Cherokee who stayed behind while the US Government forced them west in the Trail of Tears. Those who stayed behind hid in the mountains that now make up the Great Smokey Mountains National Park   .  The Cherokee people are eastern Native Americans, do not ask them where the tipis are. Tipis were made by western Native Americans. The Cherokee people lived in houses made of woven grass covered with mud, and after the European settlers arrived, log cabins.  Cherokee is one of the gateways to the  Great Smoky Mountains National Park , and its economy is mainly tourism based. There is no "downtown" to Cherokee; the entire built up area is mainly composed of hotels and tourist shops selling "Indian" themed merchandise.</field>

Settled and established in 1845 by the Brass family when they built a two-story inn and tavern, Munster became very popular soon after in 1853 as a place for truck farms because of the growing market in the near-by Chicago. Munster began to grow as a community and grew in skilled worker men such as oil men, steel workers, and buisness men from the city.  Today Munster is a quite town that is in the midst of continual growth. The town is excellent at planning and has developed an award winning school system. Despite growing larger and larger everyday, Munster has a small town friendly demeanor and one is always welcomed with a genuine interest.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Lion in the Loop, Art Institute of Chicago   The Loop is the center of Chicago and without a doubt the most iconic section of the city. If youve never been to Chicago, begin here. Whether on an official architecture cruise along the Chicago River, or an unofficial one along the veritable river of elevated trains, only the most jaded could shake that feeling of awe at the canyons of LaSalle and the cliffs of Michigan Avenue. Moreover, the Loop contains a world-class collection of  public art , in the form of huge street-side statues by many of the 20th centurys most famous sculptors.  The Loop initially got its name from the looping route of streetcars that served as the transit hub of early downtown Chicago, but the name has come to be defined by the modern eras looping route of elevated train tracks, serving seven CTA lines, which ensures the continued prominence of the area as the center of Chicagos working world. Despite the gradual northwards shift in the citys center of gravity and the centrifugal force of suburbanization, all tracks lead here and accordingly the Loop remains the most attractive location in the city for major businesses, and for most of the citys visitors.  On a work day, you wont have to walk around long to realize you are at the center of things. Busy-looking people in suits hurry in and out of tall buildings, major theaters hawk their big-name productions on neon marquees, and every block has a reminder of a scene from Ferris Buellers Day Off, The Dark Knight, or another Chicago movie. The Loop is the  United States  second largest central business district, owing largely to its historical position as the financial hub for the  Midwest  and the modern worlds biggest futures market. Many of those suits walking by (as you stand and gape) work for one of four major financial exchanges, the largest of which is the recent merger between the Merc (the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and the Chicago Board of Trade. The CBoT was the worlds first modern futures exchange, set up principally to serve the needs of the Midwest agriculture market, and along with the other major exchanges in Chicago, pioneered the massive modern derivatives industry. Not too long ago the streets sagged under the enormous profits, as the Merc and CBoT traded over nine million contracts daily, worth over $4.2 trillion. Todays economic outlook has soured, though, and the ranks of those suits have been thinned by layoffs, golden parachuting, and other extreme sports.  Forget work, though — the fun of Millennium Park and the festivals of Grant Park are here, and the Art Institute is fantastic. A walk by the Sears Tower and the Chicago Board of Trade is a requisite Chicago experience, but the Loop is eclipsed by other parts of the city in terms of nightlife, shopping, and dining. Being as it is first and foremost a business district, things shut down when the commuters punch the clock and hop on the train, so even if you have a room at one of the Loops classic old hotels, dont plan to spend all of your time here — even though your camera will likely receive no finer work-out anywhere else.

		<field name="content">Buffalo is New York States second-largest city, with (as of 2010) a population of 261,310 in the city proper and 1,135,509 in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area.  Buffalo is the cultural and economic center of the Western New York region. Though for the past half-century it has been rightly considered a stagnant working-class city that has suffered from the aftereffects of deindustrialization, Buffalos economy has turned around significantly, with an unemployment rate in August 2011 of 7.3%, significantly below the national rate of 9.1% for that month. Perhaps surprisingly given its history as a center of heavy industry, Buffalo has also recently been cited as the third-cleanest city in the United States. Recently, Buffalo was named one of the Dozen Distinctive Destinations for 2009 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, whose 2011 National Preservation Conference was held in Buffalo and was the largest and best-attended of these annual conferences in the history of that organization. Other titles bestowed on Buffalo in recent years include a placement among the "44 Places to Visit in 2009" by the New York Times, the "All-America City Award" for the years 1996 and 2002, and one of the 10 best cities in the U.S. to raise a family, according to a 2010 feature in Forbes magazine.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Over one hundred years ago, while other towns surrounding Chicago were requesting annexation to survive, Evergreen Park boldly decided to declare its independence. The population at the time was approximately 500 people. Fifty-one residents turned out on December 20, 1893 when forty of them voted for incorporation and four squared miles of area became the Village of Evergreen Park. Many of the original settlers were hard working farm families.  The Village acquired its name from the park located at 97th Street and Homan Avenue, originally intended to be the center of town. This part of the village was laid out to resemble Paris, with its wagon wheel appearance, but development in other directions has since caused it to be a residential section. The center of Evergreen Park is now 95th Street and Kedzie Avenue. From those few early settlers in the 1800s through the pre-war years of truck gardens, the post–war years and population boom of the 1950’s, to its present stature as one of the leading southwest suburbs of Cook County, Evergreen Park continues to progress and flourish.  The 75th Anniversary was celebrated in 1968 and the 100th Anniversary was celebrated in 1993. Time capsules were buried at each of these ceremonies and will be opened in the year 2018. Evergreen Park is a residential suburb located astride 95th Street (U.S. Route 12 and U.S. Route 20) adjacent to the attractive Beverly Hills section of Chicago and seventeen miles southwest of the Loop. The Village encompasses an area of approximately four square miles and is bordered by the City of Chicago on the north, south and east, and by the Village of Oak Lawn on the west. Evergreen Park is known as the "Village of Churches" as evidenced by the thirteen established religious congregations serving the community.</field>

		<field name="content">This city began as community of settlers comprised of Puritans from Boston and Pilgrims from Plymouth. In 1862, part of Seekonk was annexed to Rhode Island and the residents renamed the town East Providence. Several houses built before the Revolution are still standing today.   East Providence is located between the urban center of Rhode Island and rural southern Massachusetts.  The area is predominantly residential, with elegant waterfront property and numerous apartment complexes.  Demographically, there is a high percentage of Portuguese heritage. This community is still growing because of its central location on an available waterway, its modern highway and railroad routes, and the suburban outgrowth from the city of Providence.  East Providence is made up of three parts Rumford, Riverside, and East Providence. Riverside was known as "The Coney Island of New England" because of a major amusement park called Crescent Park. Crescent park was built in 1886 by Charles Boyden. The park contained ballrooms, a carousel, many amusement rides, hotels, and restaurants. There was a steamship that traveled to many other parks in the area. In 1979 Crescent Park was torn down. The only thing that was left was the Carousel. Now Riverside is a suburban area, located on the Narragansett Bay.</field>

The Los Angeles metro area has been a "boomtown" since the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1876, first attracting some "folks" from the Midwest and East Coast with warm winters, becoming a gateway to a remarkable diversity of immigration from throughout the Pacific Rim and Latin America.  In the 1940s, Los Angeles had the largest streetcar network in the world.  Post World War two (WWII), the Red Car network was removed due to the popularity of the automobile.  Since then the freeway and major arterials such as Wilshire Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard have reined supreme, creating the car capitol of the world known as Los Angeles.   The city of Los Angeles is huge. From the Sylmar district in the north to the Port of Los Angeles in the south, the drive can be approximately an hour an a half long; possibly longer once traffic is factored in. The sprawling L.A. metropolitan area includes smaller cities, such as  Santa Monica ,  Burbank ,  Pasadena ,  Long Beach ,  Anaheim , and  Riverside  some of which were founded around the end of the nineteenth century and retain distinct identities. Geographically, some district names within the city of Los Angeles are so common, that they are believed by some to be separate of Los Angeles when in fact, they are neighborhoods of Los Angeles.  Hollywood ,  Van Nuys , and  Bel-Air  are just some examples of well-known neighborhoods that are actually a part of Los Angeles, while  West Hollywood ,  Santa Monica , and  Beverly Hills  are independent cities.</field>

		<field name="content">Ypsilanti is Ann Arbors smaller, poorer, uglier, and infinitely cooler sibling. Surrounded by pretentious neighbors, Ypsi residents tend to see their city as more relaxed and less yuppified. Ypsilanti was the birthplace of Iggy Pop and home of the Ypsilanti Water Tower, dubbed the most phallic building in the world. Its been said that Ypsi is the Brooklyn to Ann Arbors Manhattan, and many artists have relocated to Ypsi after being priced out of Ann Arbor. This has resulted in a thriving art scene, most visible at the Shadow Art Fair each summer.  Although Eastern Michigan Universitys    enrollment of 23,000 students is more than the permanent population of the city (less thaan 20,000), and the school is the citys largest employer, with roughly 1,700 faculty and staff members, Ypsilanti is not culturally dominated by the university in the way Ann Arbor is by the University of Michigan.  Ypsilanti has long played an important role in the automobile industry. From 1920-1922, Apex Motors produced the "ACE" car. It was in Ypsilanti that Preston Tucker, whose family owned the Ypsilanti Machine Tool Company, designed and built the prototypes for his Tucker 48. In 1945, Henry J. Kaiser and Joseph W. Frazer bought the nearby Willow Run B-24 Liberator bomber plant from Ford Motor Company, and started to make Kaiser and Frazer model cars in 1947. The last Kaiser car made in Ypsilanti rolled off the assembly line in 1953, when the company merged with Willys-Overland and moved production to Toledo, Ohio. General Motors purchased the Kaiser Frazer plant, and converted it into its Hydramatic Division (now the Powertrain division), beginning production in November 1953, eventually ending production at the facility in 2010.  Ypsilanti is also the location of the last Hudson automobile dealership. Today, the dealership is the site of the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum, with a collection including an original Fabulous Hudson Hornet race car.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Franklin was founded in 1741 by the French during the French and Indian War, where French Creek meets the Allegheny River. When the British saw the French had built a fort, they sent George Washington, who would later become the nations first president, to tell the French that the territory had already been claimed by the British. The French refused, and proceeded to amass an army (including local Indians) to attack Fort Pitt and Fort Dusquesne in modern  Pittsburgh . When the British began to attack Fort Niagara, the French were forced to send their troops north and the territory was claimed by the British. After American independence from  Great Britain , the layout of the city was redesigned by Andrew Ellicott, who also helped design the layout of  Washington, D.C.  With the discovery of oil in nearby  Titusville  in 1859, wealthy oil tycoons moved to Franklin, quickly changing Franklin from an unknown to a wealthy, bustling town. With large fires consuming the oil fields in 1892 and 1894, the wealthy dispersed as quickly as they had come.    Today, Franklin, together with  Titusville  and  Oil City , is known as the Oil Region. Although the town remains rather quiet, the oil boom has left the city with many historic buildings. The architectural features range from Victorian to Gothic Revival; it is said that all of the architectural styles used in the state from 1830 to 1930 can be observed in Franklin. The Episcopal Church also shows off the citys former wealth, with its complete collection of Tiffany Windows and mahogany pews.

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Houston has a character that, while very "Texan," is also a great melting pot of many different cultures and socio-economic groups. Youll find well-to-do suburban mansions, LA-style shopping strips, Latin-American neighborhoods, towering skyscrapers, historic African-American neighborhoods fighting off gentrification, massive refinery complexes, large Asian communities, and pockets of artist communities. From October to May, the weather is relatively pleasant, and many restaurants and bars take advantage of the weather with plenty of outdoor seating and beautiful lighting. Houstons proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also makes it a lush, tropical paradise compared to the rest of Texas.  In a sense, Houston is the gritty step-cousin of wealthy Dallas and middle-class hippie Austin. You wont see many cowboys or giant hairdos in downtown Houston (outside of Rodeo season), but you will see a quite diverse mix of people servicing the oilmen, petroleum engineers and high-end doctors.  Houston is the largest city in the United States without any appreciable zoning.  While there is some small measure of zoning in the form of ordinances, deed restrictions, and land use regulations, real estate development in Houston is only constrained by the will and the pocketbook of real estate developers.  Traditionally, Houston politics and law are strongly influenced by real estate developers; at times, the majority of city council seats have been held by developers. This arrangement has made Houston a very sprawled-out and very automobile-dependent city. The benefit of this lack of zoning is that some neighborhoods like Montrose contain a plethora of hidden bars and art galleries nestled among historic neighborhoods - an arrangement not possible in zoned cities across the country.  For one desiring a walkable visit, the areas close to downtown are gradually becoming more dense and walkable as islands of trendy mixed-use developments pop up. Many areas can be downright hostile to pedestrians and bikers as sidewalks are privately built (if at all) and roads are littered with massive potholes. The city is primarily built on the energy industry and nearly everyone owns a car and drives everywhere they go, even to a destination less than a mile away.   With a few exceptions, almost everything to see or do is in Houstons urban core inside the 610 Loop and more specifically in between downtown, the Galleria, and the Texas Medical Center.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Illinois is a mostly flat plains state, with the majority being farmland except for the river valleys and the south, which are hilly and forested.  Traditionally, Illinois is subdivided into three culturally distinct regions: Northern, Central and Southern Illinois.  Northern Illinois is considered anything north of I-80 and includes the majority of Chicagoland as well as the Quad Cities and Rockford.  Central Illinois includes all areas between I-80 and I-70 including Peoria, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign with Southern Illinois occupying all areas south of I-70 including Carbondale.  Chicagoland and Metro-East (suburban St. Louis area) may be considered regions within regions and tend to be culturally different than the rest of their area.  Northern Illinois is by far the most diverse area of the state and has some of the largest population centers including Chicago, Aurora, Rockford, Naperville and Elgin.  The area benefits from a unique mixture of factors including its location next to Lake Michigan; the concentration of highways, rail and airports in the Chicagoland area and the numerous tourism opportunities in areas such as the Chain O Lakes and Galena Driftless Zone.  Central Illinois is the seat of state government and home to the States flagship university - the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Small urban areas dot the entire area including Urbana-Champaign, Peoria, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, Quincy and Decatur.  Outside of these cities, the area is largely rural and depends on agriculture as its primary economic engine.  Central Illinois has played a unique role in US history as being the home of Nauvoo, an original Church of Latter Day Saints settlement.  It also encompasses the region of Illinois informally named Forgotonia which had briefly captured national attention when residents began a mock campaign to either succeed from Illinois or the US due to lack of attention in the early 1970s.  Southern Illinois includes the cities of Carbondale, Marion, Mount Vernon and portions of Metro-East.  It is noticeably different from the rest of Illinois in that it shares more in common culturally with neighboring Kentucky and Missouri than with the rest of the state and may be informally considered part of the Upland South.  The region has been called "Little Egypt," a nickname that may be an inside joke referring to the town of Cairo, which sits at the confluence of Mississippi and Ohio rivers.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Oatman was named posthumously for Olive Oatman (1837-1903). History tells that she was a young Illinois girl kidnapped by (presumably) Yavapai Indians and forced to work for them as a slave. Later, she was traded to Mohave Indians who adopted her as a daughter, had her face tattooed in the custom of the tribe, and eventually released her in 1855 near the current site of the town.  Gold was discovered in the nearby hills in the early 1900s and the town was home to a boom that lasted until the mines closed in the 1930s. The current population of 150 is down from about 23,000 in its boom years. The main street, lined with gift shops, looks like a set from a Hollywood Western, and with good reason: Hollywood dolled up the facades to film How The West Was Won    here in 1962. A staged gunfight takes place every day at high noon. On the other side of the equation, if you show up after the tourists go home, youll start to get a real feel for the place: a town of grizzled miners and dogged entrepreneurs determined to make a living at the far edge of civilization.  While the main street is known alternatively as "Main Street" and "Oatman Road", it is also the Historic Route 66.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The original settlers of the Port Orange area were the Timucuan and Seminole Indians. During Florida’s plantation period, Patrick Dean was granted 995 acres in 1804 from the Spanish Crown which later was named the Dunlawton Plantation. The fertile soil was favorable for citrus, indigo, and sugar cane which could be shipped to market on the Halifax River. The plantation was destroyed by the Seminole indians during the Second Seminole War in 1836. The Dunlawton Sugar Mill on Old Sugar Mill Road is the last remnant of the old plantation.  The second major era for Port Orange occurred after the Civil War. Dr. John Milton Hawks, an abolitionist and United States Army Surgeon, along with other Union Army officers formed the Florida Land and Lumber Company and brought 500 freed slaves to public lands along the Halifax River, north of Spruce Creek in 1866. Dr. Hawks moved the settlement he was credited with naming Orange Port in February 1867 from the Mosquito Inlet (Ponce Inlet) to where the community lies today. By April 1867, the settlement’s name change to Port Orange because another town in the United States already had the former name. Port Orange was incorporated in 1926.   Port Orange is made up of some 150 distinct "neighborhoods", each with its own distinctive flavor. The City encompasses 26.4 square miles speckled with beautiful parks and is home to over 50,000 residents.  One of the largest annual events in Volusia is Port Orange Family Days held in October. This four-day festival which takes place at the City Center Complex focuses on celebration of family and quality of life in Port Orange and features a carnival, business and non-profit expo, children’s games, parade, food court and entertainment.</field>

Coeur dAlene also features a renowned golf course with a free-floating island green, the only such hole in the world.  Several other public and private golf courses abound.  World class snow skiing is within a 90 minute drive of downtown Coeur dAlene.  Lake Coeur dAlene offers boating and water-skiing as well as fishing for bass, trout, and salmon.  Often referred to by locals as simply "CDA," Coeur dAlene is sometimes considered the easternmost edge of of the greater  Spokane  area, although the city is the anchor of a metro area in its own right. Like much of northern Idaho, Coeur dAlene often relates more to eastern Washington than it does to southern Idaho and the capitol.</field>

Captain Benjamin Bonneville also passed through the future site of the town while he was surveying for the US government in 1834. In 1860, an Irish settler named Parson Quinn settled just east of present-day Pomeroy, and lived there for the next 40 years. Rancher Joseph M. Pomeroy purchased the land in 1864, and platted the towns site in May 1878.  Pomeroy was officially incorporated on February 3, 1886. The town has been the seat of Garfield County ever since 1882, despite fierce competition in the 1880s with neighboring towns Pataha and Asotin. The struggle to name a county seat would continue through both houses of the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1883, to Governor William A. Newell of the Washington Territory, and eventually reached the Congress in 1884.  On July 18, 1900 (despite a city ordinance which mandated fire-proof materials for downtown buildings - there had been fires in 1890 and 1898 as well) fire destroyed half of the small towns business district. The recovery took two years as the destroyed buildings were rebuilt using brick - a building boom for the small community.   In 1912, the City voted to outlaw the manufacture or sale of alcohol. This prohibition quickly led to rampant bootlegging and corruption which lasted until the 21st Amendment passed in 1933.  On August 21, 2003, following efforts by the Pomeroy Historic Committee, a 10-block section of Pomeroys downtown was placed on the National Historic Register.</field>

This group was responsible for damming Doan Brook and creating the Shaker Lakes, but the groups strict practice of celibacy eventually led to their demise in the late 1800s.  In 1912 the village of Shaker Heights was incorporated by the Van Sweringen brothers who envisioned a garden community for commuters to Cleveland.  The brothers set aside land for churches and schools, laid out curving streets, planted trees, and established a streetcar system (todays RTA) that led directly from the city to downtown Cleveland.  The towns strict building codes led to a distinctive architectural identity, and today many of the mansions and other buildings found in the city are featured in architectural texts.  Over the years the towns residents have included a variety of famous business and entertainment personalities including actor Paul Newman, comedian Molly Shannon, and football player Nate Clements.</field>

A revolt took place in 1778, the Brits took it back under control, then, in 1779 George Rogers Clark captured the city (hence the National Park of his name). The city has a university of its namesake, and was home to President Harrison in the early 1800s. It was the capital of Indiana from 1800 until 1813.  The citys history is unique compared to any other Midwestern town, and the historical relevance is plentiful. The nice thing about Vincennes - things are close together, within blocks at times, and cheap. One can eat, drink and learn on a very cheap budget.</field>

		<field name="content">Volusia County Courthouse in DeLand, Florida.   Volusia County is named after the community of Volusia, which today is a tiny, unincorporated community on the east bank of the St. Johns River where State Road 40 crosses. However, when Volusia County was carved from Orange County by the Florida legislature in 1854, the community was a prosperous steamboat landing and the largest town in the County. Keep in mind that the entire population of Volusia County barely exceeded 600 people at that time.  The community of Volusia began as a trading post sometime in the first or second decade of the 1800s. It was located where an Indian trail intersected with the St. Johns River. This location was later developed as an important supply depot for the military during the Second Seminole War in 1834-35. When commercial steamships started to travel up and down the St. Johns, the community grew and was listed as one of four post offices in the County. With the introduction of regional railroad systems in the 1880s, the community of Volusia was bypassed, and thus, its era of prosperity ended.  The origins of of the word "Volusia" is of some debate. Despite serious effort by amateur and professional  historians, no one has ever discovered a historic document which has provided the definitive answer.  There are three theories:   The name derives from a word meaning "Land of the Euchee." When the Timucuan Indian cultures died out in the early 1700s, the land in the area was uninhabited until some of the Indian tribes to the north began to migrate into the area (much like the people that have become known as Seminoles). The Euchee Indians were a tribe originally from an area in South Carolina.  The name was taken from the name of a British plantation which was located on the St. Johns River in the late 1700s. However, no one has explained where the plantation owner came up with the name.  The name is derived from the last name of one of the employees at the trading post. He is described as being well-liked and of Belgian or French descent. The story goes that his name was something like "Veluche," which was pronounced "Va-loo-shay." The post became known as "Veluches Place," hence the eventual creation of "Volusia.  There have been recent proposals by county officials to rename Volusia County to either "Daytona County" (similar name to its most famous city) or "NASCAR County" (reflecting its famous attraction, Daytona International Speedway). These proposals have been opposed by county residents.</field>

The Lake is amazingly deep at up to 350 feet and can only truly be appreciated by boat as the waterfalls and rivers cascade from the distant shore across from Devils Fork. Guided waterfalls tours are available as well as fresh water fishing charters departing from the boat ramp at the Park. The Lakes 75 mile shoreline is almost completely protected from development and is unique unto itself in the region. Visitors can either stay at the Parks cabins, campground or nearby private vacation rentals.  Reservations are a must as the region is very rural and vacancies in season are scarce. The Park is open year round and attracts over 250,000 visitors annually.</field>

		<field name="content">Many non-natives often have a hard time sizing up Dallas, and indeed, the entire Metroplex.  Dallas does not fit many of the typical Texan stereotypes (Western, laid-back, casual), but it also doesn’t often live up to some of the more notorious stereotypes of its own (pretentious, unfriendly, sterile).  The truth is, like in many things, somewhere in between.  Dallas is a wonderful place with a great deal to offer and an immense and diverse set of attractions, food and people.  From the ultra-modern and posh Uptown and Victory developments, to the old-world elegance and upper-crust attitude of Turtle Creek, to the “real life” feel of largely-suburban North Dallas, it is virtually impossible to neatly categorize Dallas beyond this: it is one of the largest cities in America, and a metro area where more and more people are choosing to work and live every year.  With that in mind, you should enjoy visiting Dallas for all the same reasons why others choose to live there.</field>

The climate of Pennsylvania is pleasant, with cold, often snowy winters, mild to hot, humid summers, and gorgeous green springtimes, and most notably, spectacular displays of colorful autumn foliage.  Pennsylvania hosts a number of vital cities, from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. The city of Philadelphia houses the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, two major national historical landmarks. The interior of the state has a number of subcultures worth exploring, including the famous Amish countryside, a religious community.  Pennsylvania is also home to a diverse group of people, with ethnic enclaves of black, Hispanic, and Southeast Asian populations in its major cities.  Pennsylvania is also diverse in that the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state are urban and densely populated, while much of the rest of the state is rural and/or mountainous.</field>

However, the region also contains other mountains.  In Colorado, the Rockies consist mainly of two broadly parallel ridge lines running diagonally across the state, with high mountain parks (valleys) between them, and its convenient to treat both the mountains of the Front Range and also the Gore and Park Ranges (two of the "rear" ranges paralleling the Front Range) as part of the region, along with the intervening parks and a few cities in the foothills that some other sources call the Eastern Slope.  The mountains in this area, with a few exceptions, are generally not as high as the southern extension of the Rockies or the geologically distinct San Juan Mountains of  Southwestern Colorado .  However, theyre still high enough to get serious winter weather, and winter sports are important here, with several world-famous  ski resorts  as well as  Rocky Mountain National Park .  East-west routes through the mountains are relatively few and far between, and generally go over high, rugged passes that may close for a while in the winter (and tax the cooling systems of passenger cars in the summer).</field>

		<field name="content">Bald Mountain ski area as seen from Ketchum Idaho   Sun Valley is located in Blaine County, which began its life over a century ago in much the same way other Idaho mountain communities did: as a hardscrabble mining area. By 1900, mining was clearly in decline in southern  Idaho. Many Idaho mountain mining settlements eventually became ghost towns, but the Blaine County communities managed to hang on, mostly due to the sheep industry.  In 1936, tourism entered Blaine County in a big way with the opening of the Sun Valley resort, which attracted the rich and famous from day one. A particularly famous early visitor was Ernest Hemingway, who spent his final days in the area and is buried in Ketchum. Today many well-known people maintain first or second homes in Blaine County.  Sun Valley revolves around tourism, with skiing in the winter and outdoor activities in the nearby  Sawtooth National Recreation Area  in the summer dominating the itinerary. The area has a reputation as a highbrow and unapologetically liberal enclave in largely conservative Idaho. While vegan and organic lifestyles may be openly scoffed at only a few miles away, its no problem at all to indulge them here.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Uncompahgre Valley was the ancestral home of the Ute nation. But in the late 1870s, the lure of the gold and silver deposits in the San Juan Mountains to the south proved too great for the white settler population to resist. Tensions boiled over with the Meeker Massacre in 1879. Pushed to the breaking point by the Federal governments insistence that they give up their nomadic way of life and become farmers, the Utes killed several whites and launched the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to  Utah , and  Southwestern Colorado , near  Cortez .  Less than a year after the Meeker Massacre, the first prospective settlers ventured into the North Fork area. They were a small group of mineral speculators from the mining town of  Lake City . Led by Enos Throop Hotchkiss, who had made his money by discovering the Golden Fleece mine at Lake City, Hotchkisss party surreptitiously scouted the valley and picked out likely homesteads while the Utes were still in possession.  Hotchkiss died in 1900, just a few months before the town was officially incorporated.  Hotchkiss built its economy on land development, coal, orchards and ranching. The coal is still mined today, a hard anthracite, "clean burning" coal much in demand for power plants around the country.   A sleepy town with a classic "Main Street" row of 19th and early 20th century storefronts, Hotchkiss is a rich agricultural area located in the foothills of the Grand Mesa. The rich soil is perfect for growing peaches, apples, cherries, as well as grapes.  By the late 20th century, grape growers had discovered the areas potential for raising white wine varietals, and Colorados wine industry migrated south from  Grand Junction  and  Palisade . The West Elks American Viticultural Area was formed in 2001. Ranging from 5,400 feet (1646 m) to 6,400 feet (1951 m) above sea level, West Elks comprises the highest vineyards in North America.  Hotchkiss is home to the Delta County Fair   , a rodeo and festival held every August.  The town is just 9 mi (14 km) away from the small town of  Paonia , which hosts the Cherry Days Festival every July.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">First erected in 1899 to honor the only geographic location in the  U.S.  where the boundaries of four states touch, Four Corners Monument is a cartographic curiosity with limited infrastructure and essentially one thing to do: to stand in a number of places simultaneously. Come prepared. There are waterless self-contained toilets, but the site has no running water, no electricity, no telephones or cell phone coverage.   The Monument is something of a paradox. It is a small and limited attraction, surrounded by low lying, nondescript bluffs that arent particularly photogenic. And yet "Four Corners" is a widely-applied label for all there are to do within a 200 to 500 mi (322 to 805 km) radius of where these four states intersect. When travelers speak of their "Four Corners" vacation, they may be headed for  Mesa Verde National Park ,  Monument Valley , the  Grand Canyon  and to other points further afield. But they may never set foot inside the Monument itself.  The Monument seems to evoke strong emotions in people, as well. Visitors are either vastly underwhelmed by this attraction, even angry they drove so far out of their way to see so little, or they are inordinately pleased with running from state to state and having their picture taken. The novelty of these intersecting boundaries makes Four Corners a popular destination, with long lines in the summer months at both the food stalls and the bright red viewing platform for the photo-op.  The Monument offers travelers a chance to learn more about Native Americans, their cultures and ways of life. There is a small visitor center, which is open year round (the park only closes on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day). It features a Demonstration Center with Native American artisans. But the best way to learn about modern day Native Americans is to strike up a friendly and respectful conversation with the various Navajo vendors. Generally, the Navajo vendors are cheerful and open to questioning. (For more information on how to properly handle this, see the  Respect  section in this article).  The average visit to the Monument lasts between 10 minutes and 2 hours, depending on whether or not people eat and thoroughly explore the Navajo stalls and visitor center.    Summer temperatures in the Monument can reach 110 ºF (43 ºC) and visitors should take extra precautions while visiting. To visit the park, youll need to bring sunscreen, some kind of hand sanitizer, as well as something to drink. In the summer, blowing dust, flies and bugs are sometimes a problem. A word of caution: metal in the park during summer (including the aluminum bronze surveyors mark) can be too hot to touch. Dont inadvertently burn yourself in your enthusiasm. The Navajo Nation is not responsible for any bodily injuries, accidents, thefts or losses that occur while on Navajo land.</field>

		<field name="content">Typical rural New England scene  Theres an expression in New England: "If you dont like the weather, wait ten minutes." The expression refers to New Englands location on the eastern side of North Americas continental climate.  New Englands coastal location does somewhat modify continental temperature extremes; but storminess is enhanced by New Englands relatively rough topography.  Northern New England winters can seem especially harsh -- if you plan to visit between December and mid-March, be prepared for freezing temperatures, wicked winds, and chills that take a couple of cups of coffee to dent. "Dress warmly" is an understatement -- in northern New England "prepare for nuclear winter" might be more accurate advice for travellers.  The best advice, though is to dress in layers that include an outer layer to block the wind, plus a sweater or jumper to be removed when exerting oneself.  Generally, the only areas of New England that are somewhat comfortable in the winter are the southern coastlines of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, which are warmed by nearby unfrozen salt water.  For the visitor prepared for cold weather, northern New Englands deep snows and crisp air can be exhilarating.  The months of April and May can be New England’s best-kept secret. In southern Vermont you will find off-season rates in many historic inns, but as noted local Robert Frost once so eloquently put it, "Natures first Green is Gold." The area is bursting with daffodils, tulips lilacs and the temperatures are mild with cool nights, just perfect.   New England summers can range from mild to uncomfortably humid. They provide a beach season of mid-June to mid-September. Most warm weather tourist destinations have a season from mid-May to mid-October. Areas right along the shoreline are often cooler and more temperate than inland areas.  New England shines during autumn. New England foliage is world-renowned for displays that rival pyrotechnics for their intense colors, rapid appearance, and equally rapid disappearance. Peak season ranges from early September at the farthest north points of Maine to early November for Southern Connecticut. Combine that with local festivals, hay rides, fresh-pressed apple cider, and fruit harvesting, and you have the recipe for a wonderful time.  As in upstate New York and along the Eastern Seaboard, many New England towns grew up around textile mills or other kinds of factories.  When those industries relocated and/or shut down during the 1900s, several of those towns fell into a depression, where they remain.</field>

During the Second Seminole War, Major William Lauderdale led his Tennessee Volunteers into the area and raised New River Fort on the site of the modern city in 1838. In 1893, a young Ohioan named Frank Stranahan arrived and built a house that served as the first trading post, post office, bank and town hall of the area. The house was built near the site of the New River Fort and still stands today as a museum, Stranahan House.   Fort Lauderdale was officially incorporated as a town in 1911, and became the seat of newly formed Broward County.  It began as a predominantly agricultural community of dairy farms and citrus groves.   More growth came with establishment of the Naval Air Station, which is now Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport.     The city and its surrounding suburbs experienced tremendous growth following the end of World War II, and the arrival of home air-conditioning.  In the 1960s, Fort Lauderdale became the center of Spring Break after the debut of the movie "Where the Boys Are."  It is now an anchor of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach Metropolitan area, the nations 6th largest metro area.</field>

Sections of the "Town of Kensington" are really beautiful, with big old Victorian homes set in a nice community by parks and Antique Rowmdash;looking much as it did when Kensington was a summer getaway from  the big city .  Usually a quiet little suburb, Kensington made the headlines of the national news three times in one year. First, the mayor banned Santa Claus from the neighborhood in late 2001, citing the separation of Church and State. How on earth can this be possible, you ask? The mayor responded to a complaint that only a Christmas tree was displayed on the grounds of the Town Hall, to the exclusion of other religious symbols. The town government responded by removing the tree. Then, realizing that there were similar grounds for objection to the local fire department flying around the neighborhood with Santa Claus in tow, tossing candy to kids, the Mayor banned Santa Claus from his usual fire engine tour of the town. Following national media attention, there was an enormous Santa Claus protest, where hundreds of Santa Clauses arrived on motorcycles to assure Kensington that St Nick would indeed be coming to town! But whats truly amazing about this whole saga is that the mayor was reelected...  The second and third news events were not so comical, however. In early 2002, a MARC train derailed in spectacular fashion, and injured over one hundred commuters. Fortunately, and somewhat amazingly, no one was killed. Later that year, the D.C. snipers first day of spree-killing included the murder of a resident, filling up her gas tank at the local Shell.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Warrenton was officialy established as a city in 1899, although the first settlement in Warrenton was in the late 1840s.  Warrenton got its name from one of the early settlers, Daniel Knight Warren.  Warrens house still stands today just down the road from the city center.  Warrenton sits on an impressive 16.7 square miles of land.  Only about 12.3 square miles of that is land, and 4.4 square miles is water. The reason 16.7 square miles is impressive is because of the population. Warrentons population is relatively small compared to the neighboring Astoria and Seaside.  Warrenton only has about 4100 people. With only 4100 people occupying the land, there is a lot of natural resources surrounding the town. Half of the area is surrounded by water, both the Pacific Ocean and the Columbia River.</field>

		<field name="content">Visitors to Downtown Disney will find that it has a split personality.  During the day, its a shopping district like no other on Disney property, with everything from mega-stores to smaller specialty boutiques.  This is the place to go if youre on day six of your vacation and still havent figured out what souvenirs you want, or if you decide you just need some good old-fashioned retail therapy.  Most of the large stores are in the Downtown Disney Marketplace area, with the specialty shops concentrated in the Downtown Disney West Side.  At night, though, the lights come on and the place really gets hopping, with live music, stage shows, and sophisticated restaurant/lounges opening their doors to a primarily adult clientele.  If you get tired of the relentlessly artificial environments of the theme parks, you can drop by Downtown Disney at night for fun of an entirely different sort.  The strongest concentration of activity at night is on the West Side, but Pleasure Island gets its share as well.  Downtown Disney also serves as a major transportation hub (especially late at night when the parks are closed), as its the most reliable way to transfer buses in order to travel between two resorts via Disney transportation.</field>

Settled in 1636 by the Dutch, it has seen many a boom and bust is today caught between those who like it as the sleepy part of town that time forgot vs. those who seek to restore its crown as the Queen of Kings County Commerce. If youre looking for something off the beaten path, Red Hook is it. Many artists call Red Hook their home, so dont be surprised to see random sculptures, galleries, or creative gardens across from city housing or burned out buildings. It was also home to the MTVs Real World Brooklyn cast in 2007. However due to a massive low income public housing project which houses most of the neighborhoods residents, precautions should be taken. Violent crime including robbery is a problem in the community. Carroll Gardens- Historians date the name to the 1960s and the real estate people like to enlarge its borders. It encompasses part of Smith St. and the nearby areas. In the 1950s and further back in time, this area was known, to the dismay of many, as Red Hook, and it still is called both Red Hook and South Brooklyn by many. Smith St. has a newly charged restaurant row, but there are still plenty of old school Italian-American gems to be found.</field>

		<field name="content">While the Jemez Mountains may look like part of the  Rocky Mountains , they are distinct from the Rockies geologically, and are the remnant of a "super-volcano" that had a catastrophic eruption about a million years ago, with several lesser but still significant eruptions since then.  This violent past shapes many of the attractions of the region:  Los Alamos  and  Bandelier National Monument  sit on a great ash flow from the climactic eruption, while  Valles Caldera National Preserve  contains a number of volcanic features and preserves the eruptive center itself.  Youll enjoy your sightseeing in the mountains more if you do a little homework to understand what youre seeing; web pages that provide good stuff on the geology, without requiring education as a geologist to grok it, are:  Jemez Mountains pages at  Volcano World   Valles Caldera page at the  Smithsonian Institutions Global Volcanism Program   The Jemez were the scene of several major forest fires in the latter part of the 20th century, the most serious of which destroyed a number of homes in Los Alamos and nearly 50,000 acres of forest.  These fires have had lasting effects on recreational opportunities in the mountains.  Several previously excellent hiking areas are either closed altogether or severely restricted because of fire damage.  Considerable rethinking of fire-prevention goals and policies is in progress, with the result that limitations on open campfires, etc., may seem a little restrictive.  Please honor these restrictions; several of the fires resulted from poorly-constructed campfires, and residents of the area are understandably skittish about it happening again.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Celebration is a community developed by the Walt Disney Company. It is considered a "perfect community" and often compared to utopian values. For example, residents must have their grass cut to a certain length, they must do certain activities such as walking their dog in a designated area, and they even need to paint their house a color from a hand-picked palette set forth by Disney. Failure to commit can result in fines and dismissal from the community. Celebration is located 5 miles from the  Walt Disney World Resort  in Lake Buena Vista,   Florida .  The design of this award-winning community includes a downtown, health center, school, post office, town hall, golf course, and a blend of townhouses, apartments and estate homes co-mingled within the same neighborhoods. Conceived as a pre-40s type of town, classical architecture prevails with garages located behind the houses and everything within walking distance. Created by Walt Disney: When Walt Disney was building Walt Disney World, or "The Florida Project," he had a concept in his head towards the end of his life. It was a City of Tomorrow. The planned city was to be a "community of the future" designed to stimulate American corporations to come up with new ideas for urban living. It was called EPCOT, which stood for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. Walt Disney is quoted as saying, "EPCOT will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are emerging from the forefront of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed. It will always be showcasing and testing and demonstrating new materials and new systems." EPCOT as its known today meant to be this amazing city, but Disney Imagineers took Disneys ideas and applied them to the EPCOT theme park with monorails, technology consistently 20 years ahead of its time, and attractions to engage Guests to think and look to the future. These ideas were then brought together by the Walt Disney Company and in sync with Imagineers created the community of Celebration. Celebration is one of the top greenest towns in the world, with residents traveling throughout town in personal electric vehicles. The Disney-created city also stimulates urban planning perfection to inspire future towns and cities, engaging in Walt Disneys ultimate goal with EPCOT.</field>

		<field name="content">The name Galena comes from the word for lead sulfide, and indeed the very reason for the towns early growth was the abundant lead found in the area, mined since the times of the Native Americans.  Galena grew to be the most important river port north of  St. Louis  (despite only being on a small tributary of the Mississippi) and in its heyday rivaled  Chicago  in size and importance.  During the Age of Railroads, however, the town passed up a Chicago-Dubuque rail line in order to "keep the sanctity of the port", a decision that began Galenas decline.  Floods and The Great Depression took their tolls as well, but soon enough people began to move back and restore the beautiful 19th century heritage.  Now Galena has reinvented itself as a tourist destination, taking in its commercial and presidential history, beautiful setting among the hilly driftless region, and ample opportunity for outdoor recreation, becoming a popular weekend destination for Illinoisans, Iowans, and Wisconsinites.</field>

The area sits at the edge of Mauis tropical rainforest, along the North Shore coastline and through portions of Mauis cooler upcountry region. Here you will find waterfalls with fresh swimming pools of clear blue water, beautiful daily rainbows, green rolling hills, unbelievable lush tropical landscapes, all surrounded by large ranches and yes even pineapple and sugar cane fields.   Haiku  has much to offer those who are willing to take a trek off the beaten path, to find the Hawaii of old, since there are no resorts within miles.  Its quiet, serene and peaceful. This truly is a journey, where you will lose your heart to Haiku and the island of Maui. Not only because of its beauty picturesque landscape, or the fact that Haiku is really one of the remaining working plantation towns with historical buildings, or due to the wonderful outdoor activities like hiking wonderful trails with great bird watching or biking the volcano, but mainly due to the type of people who make Haiku their home.   Here visitors will find the "locals" are warm, welcoming and friendly with a mix of eco farmers, long-time local families, new age wellness, spiritual leaders, healers artisans. Dont forget to stay at one of the areas bed and breakfasts, and oh my gosh the food vendors are a treat for the taste buds.  Haiku is little known but has so much to offer visitors and locals alike, yet its only minutes to all the main attractions Maui has to offer.</field>

On February 3, 1893, all of the county records and books were stolen in order to move the county seat from Oysterville to South Bend, Washington. However, it had been agreed upon that the seat would be moved to South Bend. There is a sign telling the story of this incident across from the historical Oysterville school.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The area was first settled in 1838 by George Reeves, who owned a mill and general store. No-one is quite sure how the community got its name; one theory is that a pair of German travellers, upon disembarking in the hilly area, amused the locals by proclaiming it to be "So schön und hell", meaning so bright and beautiful. Another is that the swampy area was a good breeding ground for mosquitoes, and the traders canoeing through the area had a few choice words for their attackers. The third, and most widely believed, is that when the local officials asked what his settlement should be called, Reeves (possibly having overheard those German visitors) replied, "I dont care, you can name it Hell if you want to." Evidently, the name stuck.  Despite its small size mdash; the "main drag" of Hell is all of three buildings mdash; the community has become a popular tourist destination for its irreverent name alone. The local businesses are given amusingly devilish titles, painted with licking flames, and stocked with gruesome and kitschy souvenirs of the sort you usually only see around Halloween. Every so often youll hear of a nationwide promotional contest in which the prize is "a trip to Hell". One popular photograph depicts a wintertime town sign draped in icicles ("when Hell freezes over", which is also "a cold day in Hell"), and of course the community was kept massively busy on June 6, 2006, when most items were sold for $6.66. Hell was also the inspiration for a comic book entitled Hell, Michigan mdash; created by Tilman Goins from  Morristown ,  Tennessee  mdash; which chronicles the fictional residents attempts to fight the demonic evil of their town.  Aside from its fire-and-brimstone appeal, Hell is situated in the middle of the lovely Pinckney State Recreation Area. A short drive away from the village will bring you to lakes, rivers and forests for hiking, horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing.</field>

		<field name="content">Seeing the quiet sea side community of Home today, it is difficult to imagine it as the areas hotbed for radical anarchists and nudists, but that is none the less the areas history since 1895, when after the failure of the industrial cooperative colony Glennis, located east of  Eatonville , three former Glennisites — George H. Allen, Oliver A. Verity, and B. F. ODell — set out in the summer into Puget Sound on a rowboat they built themselves to find an isolated location for a new community.  They decided upon Von Geldern Cove (also known as Joes Bay) as the site for their new Home Colony, which would be an intentional community based on anarchist philosophy. The founders purchased 26 acres (110,000 m2) there at $7 an acre, working odd jobs to pay for it. By 1896, their families had joined them and cabins were constructed.  famous anarchist Emma Goldman visited Home and later tried to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick  By 1898 a land buying corporation was set up called the Mutual Home Association, whose Articles of Incorporation and Agreement stated their purpose as "to assist its members in obtaining and building homes for themselves and to aid in establishing better social and moral conditions." Land was apportioned to those who became members of the Association, agreeing to its anarchist ideals and to pay for their lot.  The title to each members land would stay with the Association; however this was changed in 1909. The Association also held title to a meeting hall, called Liberty Hall, and a trading post.  When Home was plotted in 1901 it had increased in size to 217 acres (0.88 km2) and had become home to anarchists, communists, food faddists, freethinkers, nudists, and others who did not fit in with mainstream society. Elbert Hubbard, anarchist Emma Goldman, and national communist leader William Z. Foster visited and gave lectures.  Following the assassination of President McKinley by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz in 1901, the community came under scrutiny from outsiders, especially newspapers in nearby Tacoma. Inflammatory articles led to threats being made by a vigilante committee called the Loyal League formed by members of the Grand Army of the Republic, who planned to invade the colony by steamboat and "put it to the torch." They were stopped when the steamboat owner refused to take them.  In 1902, after charges of violation of the Comstock Act resulting from an article advocating free-love published in the local anarchist newspaper Discontent: Mother of Progress, Homes post office was closed by postal inspectors and moved two miles (3 km) to the smaller town of  Lakebay .  The radical feminist Lois Waisbrooker was a resident of Home during a later phase of her controversial career (1901 to 1904), and was involved in the prosecution that led to the closing of the Home post office.  The Association became divided into disagreeing factions called "nudes" and "prudes." The two factions were coined in a series of editorials in the Home newspaper The Agitator in which editor Jay Fox defended Homeites arrested in 1911 for nude swimming — and nude swimming in general — against those in Home who had reported them to county authorities. Because of these editorials, Fox was charged with the misdemeanor of encouraging or advocating disrespect for law or for any court or courts of justice and jailed for two months.  In 1919 the Association was dissolved and the anarchist community, as it was, ended.</field>

		<field name="content">The Niagara Falls consist of three sections.  The large Canadian falls—with their distinctive curved shape—are also known as the Horseshoe Falls.  They are separated by Goat Island from the American Falls, which are separated from the narrow Bridal Veil Falls by a small island at their south end.   Each side of the falls offers a different perspective, and it is always best to visit both sides to maximize your experience. In contrast to the panoramic view of the falls afforded by the Canadian side, what is seen from Niagara Falls, New York is a heart-pounding, sidelong, close-up look at the rushing water at the moment it tumbles over the precipice. On the American side, the immediate vicinity of the falls is part of Niagara Falls State Park, the oldest state park in the nation.  The presence of the state park (originally laid out by renowned landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted) serves to preserve the natural beauty of the area and prevent the kind of commercialization that youll find on the Canadian side. Visitors looking to experience the falls as a natural wonder will appreciate this.  During the Winter season, a lot of maintenance of the falls, tours, and surroundings takes place. Many areas, such as Terrapin Point and Luna Island, are closed due to slippery conditions. Plan accordingly and attempt to visit during the warmer seasons.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Washington Crossing Historic Park is a 500-acre park divided into two sections: the Thompsons Mill section and the Washington Crossing section.   Washington Crossing was named for its close proximity of General Washingtons crossing of the Delaware river on Christmas day of 1776.  Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze immortalized this moment with his famous picture, Washington Crossing the Delaware.  With the area being this rich in history, there are tons of ways to enjoy it.  Every year, a reenactment of the crossing of the Delaware is done on Christmas day, just like in 1776.  Come out and see General Washington and his troops cross the Delaware in full uniforms.  If you cant make it on Christmas day, the second Sunday in December is the dress rehearsal.  Additional activities, events, and demonstrations also take place on the day of the dress rehearsal.  Washington Crossing is a great spot to get away.  Just a short drive from New York City and Philadelphia, it could be your one night retreat on route between the cities, or a week long escape from the hustle of city life.  History and nature are just a few of the things you can indulge in.</field>

Acadiana is a reference to the large population of Acadians, descendants of French speakers expelled from  Nova Scotia  by the British.  These Louisiana Acadians are known as Cajuns an English corruption of Acadiens.   While the Cajuns are the dominant population of the region, since early in its history the region has also included Native Americans, Germans, Spanish, French Creoles, and Creoles of Color, all of whom made their contribution to creating Acadiana.  Many more people have contributed more recently to the vibrant region with its unique culture, dialects, and food.  While locals were long proud of their traditions, in the early 20th century Cajuns were often looked down on.  A fortunate change came about in the last third of the 20th century, when a new widespread appreciation of Cajun culture developed, especially for its music and food.</field>

Along Atlantic Avenue by the beachfront lays several salt ponds which serves as a outer wall to the distinct beaches that make this community a large tourist attraction during the summer months (May-September). This community doubles in size during the summer months due to the large attraction of families from all over New England.   Westerly is also known for its textiles and unique type of granite that is quarried from Bradford and Potter Hill regions of Westerly.

Its fairly ethnically diverse, with populations including Irish, Italians, Portuguese, Brazilians (probably the largest ethnic minority), Haitians, Tibetans, Indians, Chinese, and others. It is still the most densely populated city in New England (about 80,000 people in four square miles), so visitors will find lots of purely residential territory between the "fun" areas: Davis Square, Porter Square, Union Square, and Powderhouse Square (the location of Tufts University).  Other notable neighborhoods include Union Square and Winter Hill, erstwhile home of the "Winter Hill Gang", the organized crime group headed by Whitey Bulger in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as East Somerville, probably the last non-gentrified area, which has a substantial immigrant population.   Somerville has a number of "squares", which are areas where several of the larger roads come together and which have various stores and parking.  Navigating Somerville is easier if you consider the major squares as "hubs" connected by main streets as "spokes."  The major squares include Davis Square, Teele Square, Powderhouse Square, Union Square, Magoun Square, and Ball Square. Many intersections have small plaques dedicating them as squares named after notable Somerville residents, frequently war veterans, but these areas are never actually referred to by those names.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">At the 2010 census, Clarence had a population of 30,673 citizens living on 53.5 square miles (138.6nbsp;km²) of land thats mostly flat, but bisected by the Onondaga Escarpment (known locally as "the Ledge") which runs in a roughly west-to-east direction through the southern part of town. With a median household income of $83,281 per year (in that same census), Clarence is the wealthiest town in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. In addition to its upper-middle-class and somewhat snobby reputation, Clarence is known as a town that is politically conservative and overwhelmingly white (the 3.6% of the population that is Asian represents by far the largest visible minority in Clarence, with other groups making up no more than 1% of the population each).  Clarences development pattern is typical of Buffalos second-ring suburbs: the parts of town nearest the city—principally Harris Hill and the Transit Road corridor—are fully suburbanized with (respectively) leafy residential subdivisions and a massive commercial strip of shopping centers, stores and restaurants, while its outer fringes are still largely rural and agricultural, looking much as they did a century ago. In the transition zone is found some of the toniest real estate in the Buffalo area, with McMansions in exclusive communities such as Spaulding Lake selling for $750,000 on average—and often much more. Like many second-ring suburbs, over the past few years Clarence has sought to impose limits on suburbanization and particularly on the encroachment of new development onto agricultural land.   The Onondaga Escarpment runs through Clarence in a roughly east-to-west direction; outcroppings of flint like those seen here were used by the local Indians to make arrowheads and were quarried by early townspeople. This photo was taken at the Escarpment Sanctuary, which is described later on in this article.</field>

Tom Kitayama, who served on the citizens committee, became its first mayor. He was the first Japanese American to hold public office in California, just 14 years after the end of World War II.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Newark is unique in that it is completely surrounded by the larger city of Fremont.  Newark was originally planned to be incoporated into the city of Fremont along with five other townships in the area (Mission San Jose, Niles, Centerville, Irvington, and Warm Springs), but decided to pull out when it was slated to be the industrial area of Fremont.  Instead, Newark incorporated in 1955, recently celebrating 50 years as a city.   Like the other five townships, Newark has a rich history.  Originally founded as a railroad town in the 1850s, Newark was a small village complete with a hotel, church, and school.  Newark was also the home to the Carter Brothers company, which manufactured hundreds of train cars for the ever growing train industry, as well as cable cars for San Francisco.  The Rose of Sharon church, built in 1880, still stands on Sycamore Street, and the old Carter Hotel still stands on the corner of Thornton avenue and Ash street (there are plans to make it a museum).  Newark also boasted a major steel foundry during this time, which manufactured stoves.  Today, Newarks major industries are electronics and salt, and has been home to such tech giants as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett Packard.  Newark is also home to the Cargill salt company (formerly Leslie Salt).</field>

To an increasing number of travelers and curious New York natives, the area offers a diversity of mostly reasonably-priced restaurants representing many of the worlds cuisines, including Indian, Thai, Korean, Mexican, Peruvian, Italian, and Argentine, just to name a few.  The original tract of land that became Jackson Heights extended approximately from Roosevelt Avenue on the south to Northern Boulevard on the north, and from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway / 69th Street on the west to Junction Boulevard on the east, an area of about a square mile.  These are still the boundaries recognized by many residents, although sometimes the larger, low-rise area stretching north of Northern Blvd. to LaGuardia Airport is also considered part of Jackson Heights.    South Asian businesses cluster around the block of 74th Street between Roosevelt Ave. and 37th Ave.  Restaurants and other businesses catering to the growing Mexican community cluster on Roosevelt Ave., which runs under the elevated 7 Flushing Line of the New York subway.  37th Avenue has many local shops.  82nd Street and Junction Boulevard are mostly discount shopping streets with a Latin flavor.

		<field name="title">Chicago/Rogers Park</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">When Philip Rogers arrived in Chicago for the first time in 1834, he immediately began making plans to leave. There was mud everywhere, the narrow streets were choked and chaotic, and the winters were brutal. But he was stuck in Chicago because the waterways back to New York were frozen, so Rogers had to wait out the winter; by the spring, he had a line on a pretty good team of oxen, so he headed as far north as he could, past the limits of the city and its fringe settlements, out to wild swampland where Indian villages were still resident — and there began Rogers Park.  The nature of Rogers Park is calamity amid beauty and the equality of impulse toward each. In this way, many of the neighborhoods key events can be understood: the secession of the West Ridge area (sometimes called West Rogers Park) over whether to incorporate as a village (which they did anyway); the 1894 "Home-Made Transfer War," in which Rogers Park residents stuck it to railroad tycoon Charles Yerkes by refusing to pay extra to ride the northern extension of his streetcar line, and tried to pass off the transfers theyd made at home on the conductors; and the "Cabbage Head War" of 1896, in which a Rogers Park politician gave unsophisticated West Ridge farmers an unflattering nickname, and they proved him wrong by putting cabbages on poles and marching on his house.  With regular floods from the wild and swampy beaches to the east, annexation to Chicago and its sewage services proved a strong temptation. As the city surged north, a building boom followed, and Rogers Park was blessed with a gorgeous stock of residential and commercial buildings; West Ridge wound up with long blocks of lovely, modest Prairie-style bungalows. Only one famous name is still in the area (Frank Lloyd Wrights Emil Bach House), but the routine beauty of the architecture in Rogers Park and West Ridge is still incredible.   The diversity, too, is unrivaled in a notoriously segregated city. Rogers Park has always been the most beautiful place in Chicago where basically anyone could afford to live — silent Irish generations still fighting the Cabbage Head War in their sleep, and immigrants newly arrived from  Serbia , from  Jamaica , from the  Sudan . For a visitor, special mention has to go to the Indian community on Devon Avenue. Between roughly 2200 W and 2700 W Devon, among thriving import stores that specialize in saris, spices, and the latest Bollywood dreams, there are a number of amazing Indian and Pakistani restaurants that will almost certainly spoil you for the stuff back home (assuming "back home" is anywhere but the  Indian subcontinent ). The only day not to go is Tuesday, when many businesses and restaurants are closed.  Edgewater, on the other hand, is remarkably laid-back. It was originally demarcated as part of the  Uptown  community area, but when that area went into economic decline, Edgewater residents swiftly seceded and established their own neighborhood. Today, it segues neatly into Andersonville to the south, with a few gay cultural institutions and several nice restaurants, coffee shops and bars.</field>

		<field name="content">Red Wing is the home of Red Wing Shoes and the Red Wing Pottery.  In the 1870s, Red Wing was the number one wheat port in the world.  The population is comprised of many people of German and Scandinavian origin.  The original pottery closed in 1967, and the building is now an outlet mall. There is a new Red Wing Pottery at the extreme west end of town, still making wonderful pottery.    Located on the banks of the Mississippi, Red Wing is known for its wooded bluffs and neighborhoods that nestle into the valleys between the bluffs.  Most prominent of the bluffs is Barn Bluff, which rises steeply above downtown and the river.  Sorins bluff offers commanding views of the town and the river.  Other bluffs rise throughout the city, adding scenic variety.  Red Wing has a number of parks and two golf courses. Colvill, Bay Point and Levee parks are on the river bank.  Colvill park, near the east (downstream) end of town, is home to the citys water park and is a popular picnic destination. Bay Point park, near downtown, the Pottery district, and marinas, is also a popular picnic destination. Levee park lies along the downtown riverfront, across the tracks from the railroad depot. Memorial Park covers most of Sorins bluff and offers road access, scenic overlooks and hiking.  Barn Bluff is also city parkland and offers hiking trails to the summit.  It is also a popular rock climbing destination.  Several other parks are also scattered around town.  The harbor in Red Wing is spectacular, and includes the Boathouse Marina.  Red Wing has one of the few bridges south of the Twin Cities connecting Minnesota with Wisconsin (the others are in Hastings, Wabasha, Winona, Dresbach and La Crescent).  The town is largely a tourist town now, and it offers considerable charms.  There are also many beautiful and historic homes in Red Wing, including an octagon house on 3rd Street, which is also a bed breakfast.</field>

For nearly a century, the CO Canal was the lifeline for communities and businesses along the Potomac, as coal, lumber, grain, and other agricultural products gently floated down the canal to market. This magnificent water highway linked the rapidly growing west to the east and played an important role in the growth and development of the country.</field>

		<field name="title">Philadelphia/Center City West</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">When Philadelphia was first settled, the core of the city was to the east on the Delaware River, in what is now Old City.  City founder William Penn plotted out the entire grid street structure of Center City from the Delaware to the Schuylkill Rivers so that the city would develop in an organized fashion, and over time the city did extend development westward and beyond.   Since Old City was originally where the business and market areas were concentrated, much of the western half of Center City became the residential neighborhood. A lot of the housing stock dates from the 1800s, when wealthy businessmen built their homes alongside communities of working-class neighborhoods.  In the 1950s, Philadelphia began to expand the business district westward as well, and with the University of Pennsylvania located just across the Schuylkill River, the area has retained its desirability for many residents.  In particular, Rittenhouse Square is surrounded by high-rise apartment towers housing the moneyed elite, and the neighboring blocks have long been one of the most desirable residential locations in Philadelphia.  Fortunately, the park itself has retained a unique ability to exclude no one, no small feat considering Philadelphias history of tension between different racial and social classes.  On any given day, especially weekends and in the summer, the park will be populated and used by just about anyone and everyone.  Commercial businesses came westward with the planning of Penn Center, a rather unwelcoming business district west of City Hall just north of Market Street.  However, this enabled other commercial development to occur in the area, and in 1985 One Liberty Place became the first building to break the unofficial height limit in Philadelphia, which was top of Penns hat on City Hall.  With a ground floor mall at the base of the building, this development helped spur retail development, which in turn contributed to the reversal of urban blight and flight in the early 1990s. Today, the three blocks north of Rittenhouse Square (Walnut, Sansom and Chestnut Streets) and eastward to Broad Street is Center Citys upscale shopping district, where fashionable clothing brands have established a presence. In addition, many restaurants, bars and nightlife destinations are located in this particular area as well.  North the business district is the spectacular Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand boulevard that begins at the famous LOVE Park near City Hall and continues northwest, through Logan Circle, and ends at the Philadelphia Art Museum and Fairmount Park.  Designed in 1917, the Parkway is one of the citys earliest urban renewal projects and takes many of its cues from similar boulevards in France. Today, the parkway is the spine on which most of the citys museums are located.</field>

		<field name="content">Sunset Park is often called New York Citys little Puerto Rico and Brooklyns Chinatown and is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City. Located just less than 20 minutes away from  Downtown Brooklyn , Sunset Park is a place for all families to come and shop, and locals can be seen running errands in the heart of the neighborhood along 5th Avenue between 60th and 44th Streets. Its hilly terrain gives magnificent views of Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan, Staten Island, Jersey City and the nearby Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Besides the Hispanic part of the neighborhood filled with families of Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican and other backgrounds, the Chinese also put Sunset Park on the map with its countless Chinese restaurants found on 8th Avenue between 60th and 40th Streets. Besides the diversity, Sunset Park also has a severe drug problem and was the site of the August 8, 2007 Brooklyn tornado. At least 40 buildings and 100 cars were damaged. Borough Park contains the biggest Chasidic Jewish community in the city. You will see lots of kosher foods on sale, and shops that are closed every Friday night and Saturday but open on Sunday, due to religious rules. If these things are unfamiliar to you, a trip to Borough Park may be worthwhile. Kensington is located south of  Prospect Park . It is the most diverse neighborhood in Brooklyn and is one of the most diverse in the United States. It currently is one of the "up and coming" neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Many new trendy restaurants and boutiques have opened making this neighborhood a hotspot to now reside. It is served by the F and G trains at Church Avenue, and the Q train at Beverly Road and Cortelyou Road. Bay Ridge has traditionally been a residential Irish-Italian-Norwegian neighborhood, but recently has seen an influx of Arab, Asian and Russian families as well. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge connects to here from Staten Island, and Fort Hamilton, a United States Army Base, is here as well. There is a great variety of good values in food to be had in this neighborhood, especially on 3rd Avenue. The neighborhood is also one of the top bar areas in the non-downtown area of Brooklyn. Bensonhurst used to be Italian as far as the eye could see, but it now contains Albanian, Pakistani, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, and many Eastern European immigrants as well. Nonetheless, it is still the center of Brooklyns Italian community and is one of the most well-known Italian-American neighborhoods in the United States. The train runs above ground and it is a lively place with an Old New York feel. Many of the best "unknown" restaurants in Brooklyn (known locally but often ignored by the Manhattan-based establishment) can be found in Bensonhurst. Get there by taking the D train to 18th, or 20th Avenues, or Bay Parkway.</field>

		<field name="content">Sharing no land mass in common with Michigans Lower Peninsula, the Upper Peninsula is, sadly, too-often left off in published maps in newspapers or magazines, or treated as a part of Wisconsin. The U.P. is, however, a real treasure to visit with much to offer to any nature lover! Plentiful sandy public beaches, breathtaking recreational and fishing lakes, and vast state and national parks and forests make the region an ideal location for a vacation in any season. If you enjoy the outdoors, this natural jewel is a place for you.     The UP is mostly rural; its largest city,  Marquette , tips the scales at just under 20,000 people.  The population is primarily of Finnish or Swedish decent, and also includes populations of Menominee, Ojibwa Chippewa descent. You will also encounter many people with Italian or French names; the U.P. was first explored by the French, who built the first trading posts at Sault-Ste. Marie and St. Ignace in the 1600s, and named many of the earliest towns. The U.P. was dominated by the fur trade until the 1800s, at which time most towns were formed as mining or logging operations. While mining of copper, iron ore, and other minerals has dropped off since the mid-1900s, the lumber industry is still going strong. A good example of the heritage of the area is preserved at Fayette Historic State Park south on 183 from US-2.</field>

It was chosen over the nearby town of Buford as the site of a turntable which led to its early growth.  In 1951, oil was first discovered in the Williston Basin.  Williston experienced rapid growth during its first oil boom in the 1980s.  After the boom died down, the population shrank to about 13,000.  Geologists recently discovered 4.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Bakken Formation.  The Three Forks Salish Formation also contains recoverable oil.  With these recent discoveries, Williston is experiencing another oil boom and has rapidly increased in size.  While the rest of the country remains in a recession, Williston boasts a strong economy, one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, plenty of jobs, and the highest wages in North Dakota.    Despite the recent growth, Williston still maintains a small town atmosphere.  Most residents are friendly and will happily give visitors directions.        Williston  news  and  weather .</field>

		<field name="content">Comprised of environmentalists, new age-ers, artists, activists, as well as coal miners, organic farmers and ranchers, Paonia prides itself on its off-beat culture.  For a small town, Paonia is a bastion of progressive media, community activism and liberal thinking. Downtown Paonia boasts The High Country News   , an internationally award winning environmental newspaper renown for its investigative jourinalism. KVNF (90.9 FM)    is a left-leaning Paonia-based public radio station that broadcasts from  Grand Junction  to  Lake City .   Grand Avenue in Paonia is an eclectic mix of art galleries and boutique shops, and makes for a diverting couple of hours of browsing.  Its somehow fitting that a town filled with so many aging Flower Children from the 1960s is also named after a flower. Incorporated in 1881, Paonia was named by its founder, Samuel Wade, for the peony rootstock which he brought with him by covered wagon. Wade submitted the Latin name for the flower, "Paeonia" as the official town name to the US Postal Service. Unfortunately, the Post Office wouldnt allow the extra vowel. So the name got shortened to "Paonia."  Paonia is a rich agricultural region with many orchards, organic farms and vineyards. In 2001, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms designated the mesas around Paonia as the "West Elks American Viticultural Area." At 6,417 ft (1956 m) above sea level, this wine region is amongst the highest in the world. Grapes grown in the area include Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Noir.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The city is named after King Louis IX of  France . St. Louis is known by the nickname of The Gateway to the West. The city was the last major stop before pioneers journeyed Westward to the Pacific coast. The city also played a large part during the steamboat era due its position at the confluence of the Mississippi River and the Missouri River. St. Louis was acquired from France by the United States during President Thomas Jeffersons term in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The transfer of power from  Spain  was made official in a ceremony called, "Three Flags Day." On March 8, 1804, the Spanish flag was lowered and the French one raised. On March 10, the French flag was replaced by that of the USA. In 1904, St. Louis hosted that years  Worlds Fair  and the Summer Olympic Games. Many of the parks, buildings, and finer homes in St. Louis were built around this time period. While there are few, if any, living residents who attended the Fair, it holds an important place in the modern development of the city.   Before  Detroit  became Americas automotive capital, St. Louis was the largest producer of American automobiles in the early part of the 20th century. Midtown and Downtown still have many of the original warehouses and factories standing, but most have been converted to other purposes, such as loft apartments, shops and restaurants. St. Louis was also home to a bustling fashion manufacturing industry in the early 1900s, centered on Washington Avenue downtown. As with the auto industry, the last remnants of the fashion manufacturing industry can be found in the recently rehabbed warehouses which now contain new businesses and loft condominiums.  In the late 20th century, St. Louis began a transformation from a manufacturing and industrial economy into a globally known center for research in Medicine, Biotechnology, and other sciences. Firms such as Monsanto, Centene, Solae, Energizer, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Edward Jones, Wells Fargo Advisors (formerly A.G. Edwards), Anheuser-Busch/Inbev are headquartered in St. Louis. ATT and Bank of America operate major regional offices here. Two major private research universities, Washington University in St. Louis and Saint Louis University, are an important part of the local economy and society.  St. Louis is truly a city of neighborhoods, each with its own distinct flavor and culture. There are 79 government-designated neighborhoods within the City of St. Louis, many of which have associations and councils that exercise wide control over development and subsidies from the highest to the very lowest local level. Some neighborhoods contain avenues of massive stone mansions built as palaces for heads of state visiting the 1904 Worlds Fair, and now occupied by some of the more wealthy families and individuals in the City of St. Louis. Other neighborhoods are predominantly middle class and working-class and have retained their singular cultural identity for 200 years. Today, most of them have endured as strong and cohesive communities for their residents.</field>

		<field name="content">Minnesotans generally present a cheery, genial attitude ("Minnesota nice") and may be caught off-guard when people dont reciprocate. Minnesotans cheery attitude combined with a sing-song accent contrasts them with their fellow Midwesterners. Also, Minnesota represents a rare left-wing presence in the Midwestern United States, famously described in the book Main Street by Minnesota author Sinclair Lewis as Mr. Stowbody, "Trouble enough with these foreign farmers; if you dont watch these Swedes they turn socialist or populist or some fool thing on you in a minute." In fact, these Swedes and foreign farmers did turn socialist, forming the Farmer-Labor Party in 1918, electing 3 successive governors, four senators and eight US representatives, until it merged with the Minnesota Democratic party in 1944. The state still maintains liberal leanings and is home to the second largest openly homosexual population in the US. Combine Minnesotas cultural eccentricities with its beautiful forests and lakes and you have a gem for any tourist in the Midwestern US.  Unlike many other US states that sport several major urban centers, most of Minnesotas urban culture is centered in the "Twin Cities" of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which effectively form one large city divided into separate political areas.  Although other urban centers exist in Rochester and Duluth the centralization of population, wealth and political power in the Twin Cities makes visiting "the Cities" a very different experience than the rest of the state.</field>

		<field name="content">Modesto began in the mid to late 1800s as a stop along the railroad between Sacramento to Los Angeles.  At the time, it was surrounded by sprawling farmlands.  Over time, as the city grew, they began to build dams and canals throughout the neighboring foothills to help irrigate the farmland.  After World War II, suburban areas expanded, and Modesto was no exception: by 1980 the city had 100,000 people, and by 2000 it had 200,000.  The proximity to the bay area and relatively cheap real estate helped the city become a popular city for commuters to live in.  Today, Modesto is one of a few large cities in the San Joaquin valley, and is home to a unique blend of bay area and farming cultures.</field>

		<field name="content">The Amish, known as "the gentle people, comprise nearly half of the countys population (total population estimated at 40,000+) making this region the largest Amish settlement in the world. The area also has many Mennonites, who are also a part of The Anabaptist Movement that moved here from Europe, at the invitation of William Penn . When travelling to and driving in this area, be alert for the horse-drawn Amish buggies, pedestrians on the roads, children walking and livestock crossing and being herded on the roads, all have the right of way on the roads.   Horse-Mule drawn impliments.  When you are visiting the towns and attractions in Holmes County, keep in mind that most of the people selling trinkets and wares as well as the shop owners are not Amish, although some are Mennonite.  Items such as cheese, smoked meats, quilts and oak wood furniture most likely are manufactured and finished locally. (Some quilts are made in China, if making a purchase that can run into the thousands of dollars, make sure you know what you are buying)  The items or places you find branded "Amish" may or may not in fact be Amish. Amish do not use the word "Amish" as a marketing ploy, this is something invented by the "English" (as Amish refer to non-Amish). Usually you will find that merchants add terms like Amish Made or Amish Country to link a product to the Amish.   Photography: You should avoid taking photographs of Amish, Amish farms, Amish events, and especially Amish children. Why? This is, of course against their religion. Even asking permission is treading on their religious culture and would be considered quite rude or even racist in nature. This is a different culture and ethnic group of people with deep religious principals. Please be as considerate of their religion, as you would expect one to be of yours. It may be a bit overstated but, waiving a camera around in Holmes County is about as popular as waiving around a gun in a Chicago bar. Most benefit auctions have signs posted, "No Cameras/No Photography", you will find the same at livestock/exotics auctions at Mt. Hope.  The BEST place to begin ones trip to Ohios Amish Country is the Amish and Mennonite Heritage Center, located just outside Berlin (pronounced BURR-linn, NOT Burr-LINN) on County Road 77. They offer a very moving tour of the 360-foot cyclorama (called the "Behalt" mural), and have a great documentary film titled, "The Amish: How They Survive." Take the tour and buy the film if you want to learn about Amish culture.</field>

Princeton—currently a community of 14,239 residents—is located in Mercer County, New Jersey.  Home to one of the top three University’s in the nation, Princeton is a town filled with college students, beautiful scenery, and historical features.  The Universitys Nassau Hall served as the Capitol of the United States for a single summer in the late eighteenth century. Princeton counts among its former residents Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann.  Visitors should note that the prestigious Princeton mailing address extends far beyond the Borough and Township limits.

Only one hour from the Oregon border and sitting right on the Pacific coast, opportunity for outdoor adventures is endless.  Humboldt is one the most unique places in California, if not the world (containing many of the worlds largest trees), and should be traveled to and experienced by all.  The coastal towns are generally quite cool in climate, while just a few miles inland the fog and overcast are less prevalent. For example,  Blue Lake  could be quite sunny, while  Arcata  could be drizzly, or  Fortuna  warm and pleasant, while  Ferndale  is socked in. If after several days of mist you seek sun, it is possible at times to walk a few miles east to find it.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Columbia was founded in 1851, relatively late in the Gold Rush for founding towns, when a mining party camping overnight during a trip to Calaveras County stayed briefly to dry their blankets overnight after a rainstorm. One of the party decided to try panning in a nearby stream, and found gold in his first pan. Within a few months, several thousand miners were in the vicinity, in one of the richer areas of placer mining. Although mining largely stopped because of the seasonal drying up of the stream, a town was laid out and built, largely on speculation that water for mining could be obtained by an ambitious project using wooden flumes and ditches to bring water from the Stanislaus River.  This water project was successful and Columbia became a thriving and wealthy Gold Rush town during the 1850s. Around 1860, however, the placer mining had petered out, and the town lost population and stagnated. This stagnation led to town to change little, and by the 1930s attempts were begun to preserved it as a good example of a Gold Rush town. In the 1940s it was purchased by the state of California and made into a State Historic Park.</field>

This was arguably the largest migration of the human race in such a short time.  While most of these prospectors failed in their efforts to gain riches (the ones who made the money were the shopkeepers), their legacy remains in the many towns that now cluster amongst the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.</field>

		<field name="content">Located in a region where native Comanches, Mescalero, and Lipan Apache Indians once roamed, Monahans history as a community extends back to the late 1880s with the expansion of the Texas and Pacific Railway across the south plains. For the few people living in West Texas, the building of a transcontinental railroad through the area meant the arrival of civilization. In the summer of 1881, Texas and Pacific Railroad contracted with surveyor John Thomas Monahan, who discovered that the lack of water for the laying crew and their animals would slow down construction of the rail. Monahans digging of a water well produced an abundance of good water (250,000 US gallons (950,000 L) a day) and was instrumental in the success of the city. Prior to this solution, water had to be hauled from the area of Big Spring, Texas.  The availability of cheap land encouraged settlers to form a small community on the track known as Monahans Well. However, when oil was discovered in the area in 1926, the destiny of the community changed directions. Oil discovery brought people of many occupations and of varied interests to Monahans. The local economy began to change from an agricultural to an industrial economy,</field>

		<field name="content">Tuolumne County is one of the original counties in California, populated (except for the indigenous Mi Wuk Indians, who have been there thousands of years), by gold miners who came to the area a few months after the famous discovery to the north that started the Gold Rush.  The county consists of two types of terrain--foothills, Gold Country rolling hills, and pine,fir, and cedar forests that are part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  The countys economy historically has been mining, particularly gold, timber, and tourism.  Mining is now at imperceptible levels, and and timber has been much reduced for various reasons, including environmental regulations.  Tourism is a major industry, based on visitors interested in the history of the Gold Country, simply visiting a different environment, or visiting the forest or the ski and snow play areas.  Tourists heading to Yosemite National Park also often pass through the area, either directly on Highway 120 as they pass through Groveland and the southern part of the county, or taking side trips to the other areas of the county. More recently, there has been a migration of retirees from the Bay Area to Tuolumne County.</field>

There are small starter homes, such as capes available in North Merrick. These might be 2 bedroom houses with one bathroom. As you travel south, the homes get larger and more expensive. The houses on the water are generally the most expensive and expansive, with docks in the backyard. There are also beautiful, stately homes in the Merrick Woods section.  One thing that people like to note is that Merrick is ten minutes away from Jones Beach, where people go to relax and occasionally see first-rate concerts at their stadium. Merrick also has many Houses of Worship. There are five temples, two Roman Catholic Churches (Sacred Heart and Cure of Ars), a Greek Orthodox Church and the Indian Mar-Thoma Church to mention just a few. It is also worth noting that some very successful people, famous and infamous, originated from this town. Some of them are Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerrys, Lindsay Lohan, singer Deborah Gibson, designer Michael Kors as well as Season 10s American Idol contestant Robbie Rosen. Merrick has two libraries. Both of them are state of the art facilities, one in South Merrick and the other in North Merrick.</field>

The railroad owners built the first version of the amusement park on Santa Monica pier as an attraction to fill empty train seats on weekends.  Santa Monica grew into an urban, eclectic, and prosperous beach city whose real estate values are amongst the most pricey in the world.  Santa Monica is a very desirable city whose people are drawn to its accessibility and its progressiveness as a community.  Today, Santa Monica is a mixture of very affluent, single-family neighborhoods, renters drawn by the high quality of life, lifelong surfers, young professionals and students.  Tourists visiting the Los Angeles region will find Santa Monica as one of the best situated locations to base their trip.  There are plenty of hotel, restaurant and entertainment options, as well as close accessibility to major sights like Venice Beach, Malibu and Beverly Hills.  Visitors will also note the beach cities moderate climate; during the summer and fall, as the mercury soars to 100 in the San Fernando Valley and 90 downtown, Santa Monica usually remains at a very comfortable 75 degrees.  Santa Monica has three  Visitor Information Centers  that feature experienced Travel Counselors, foreign language line, tickets to area attractions and free visitor information on attractions, hotels, dining, museums, galleries and entertainment.</field>

		<field name="content">Reading is a very old and historic city in Pennsylvania. It was once home to one of the largest railway systems in the country, (where the familiar Reading Railroad from the Monopoly board comes from)which radiated in all directions from the City of Reading. The construction of the railroad was probably the single greatest factor in the development of Berks county. While Reading has experienced an economic downturn, efforts are being made to try and revitalize the citys downtown area with such projects as the Sovereign Center, the Sovereign Performing Arts Center, the Miller Center and the recently created Goggle Works Center for the Arts, and the Reading Movies 11, which includes an IMAX theater. Today, Reading is a city pulsating with industrial life. It is also well equipped with agencies that represent civilization at its best-churches, hospitals, clubs, fraternal societies, recreational centers, schools and colleges, a historical society, an art institute, and a daily newspaper. Reading claims the distinction of a symphony orchestra, two choral societies, a chamber musical ensemble, a civic opera company, and many other excellent music groups that have contributed to the citys prestige as a center of art and culture. Reading is not only an excellent place to visit because of what it has to offer but also because of its convenient location in relation to other popular destinations. Reading is centrally located, about an hour northwest of Philadelphia, 2 and 1/2 hours southwest of New York City, 3 hours north of Washington, DC, 40 minutes from the Amish country and about an hour from Hershey park and Dorney Park which offers a lot of opportunities for day trips for tourists staying in the area. Reading also lies only about 2 1/2 to about 3 1/2 hours from some beautiful shore resorts in New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.</field>

After the arrival of the railroad in 1876, Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated in 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system. By 1925 the population was estimated at 3,031, and it grew to over four thousand before World War II.  Large-scale industrialization began in 1954 with the arrival of a General Motors assembly plant. Automotive and aerospace development gave the city one of the nations greatest population growth rates between 1950 and 1990. Arlington became one of the "boomburgs," the extremely fast-growing suburbs of the post-World War II era. U.S. Census Bureau population figures for the city tell the story: 7,692 (1950), 90,229 (1970), 261,721 (1990), and 365,438 (2010).   DFW Airport opened in 1974 which also contributed to unparalleled growth in the region.</field>

Two major traffic circles along Woodward Avenue surround Campus Martius Park and Grand Circus Park, both gathering points. The city has ample parking much of it in garages. Many historic buildings have been converted into loft apartments, and over sixty new businesses have opened in the Central Business District over the past two years. Downtown Detroit features the Renaissance Center, including the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, the Detroit Marriott, with the largest rooftop restaurant, Coach Insignia. Many restaurants emanate from the Renaissance Center, Greektown, the arts and theatre district, and stadium area. Joining the eastern, riverfront parks, the city has the 982-acre (3.9nbsp;km²; 2.42nbsp;sqnbsp;mi) Belle Isle Park with the large James Scott Memorial Fountain, historic conservatory, gardens, and spectacular views of the city skyline.  Visitors may reserve a public dock downtown at the Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor. Great Lakes Cruises are also available. Surrounding neighborhoods such as Corktown, home to Detroits early Irish population, New Center   , Midtown, and Eastern Market    (the nations largest open air market), are experiencing a revival. Detroit has a rich architectural heritage, such as the recently restored historic Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel, the Guardian and Fisher buildings with exquisitely ornate interiors and exteriors, the Detroit Institute of Arts (top five museums in the country) to name a few. In 2005, Detroits architecture was heralded as some of Americas finest; many of the citys architecturally significant buildings are listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as among Americas most endangered landmarks.  Detroit is the largest city in the U.S. to offer casino resorts. The three major casino resorts are MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown, and MotorCity. A fourth major casino is just across the river in Windsor, Canada.  Detroit Metro Airport is one of the few to offer world class hotel and meeting facilities inside the terminal. The Renaissance Center and the Southfield Town Center are among the nations finest mixed use facilities for large conferences. Downtown Detroit serves as the cultural and entertainment hub of the metropolitan region,  Windsor ,  Ontario , and even for  Toledo ,  Ohio  residents, many of whom work in metropolitan Detroit. While most of the regions attractions are in the city of Detroit, tourists will find that nearly all of the shopping malls are located in suburbs, such as Troy. The Detroit-Windsor metro area population totals about 5.9 million; it jumps to 6.5 million if Toledo is included. An estimated 46 million people live within a 300 mi (480 km) radius of Detroit. The citys northern inner ring suburbs like Ferndale, Southfield, Royal Oak, and Birmingham provide an urban experience in the suburbs complete with dining, shopping and other attractions. The Detroit area has many regal mansions, within the city and especially in Grosse Pointe, Bloomfield Hills, and Birmingham.  Ann Arbor provides the nearby experience of a college town.  Detroit is an international destination for sporting events of all types; patrons enjoy their experience in world class venues.

Detroit is known as the worlds "Automobile Capital" and "Motown" (for "Motor Town"), the city where Henry Ford pioneered the automotive assembly line, with the worlds first mass produced car, the Model T. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt called Detroit the "Arsenal of Democracy." Today, the region serves as the global center for the automotive world. Headquartered in metro Detroit, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all have major corporate, manufacturing, engineering, design, and research facilities in the area. Hyundai, Toyota, Nissan, among others, have a presence in the region. The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is a global leader in research and development. Metro Detroit has made Michigans economy a leader in information technology, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Michigan ranks fourth nationally in high tech employment with 568,000 high tech workers, including  70,000 in the automotive industry. Michigan typically ranks among the top three states for overall research and development investment expenditures in the US.

		<field name="content">Rochester, known as The Flower City and The Worlds Image Centre, is the third-largest city in the state of New York, after  New York City  and  Buffalo . Lake Ontario lies to its north, with the Genesee River flowing northward through the city and over a set of three waterfalls.  The historic Erie Canal also runs along the citys borders.  But Rochester is much more than just its waterways.  The city loves to celebrate its long history of industry and invention, taking pride in the many innovators and social reformers that have made their marks here.  It also looks to the future, to the new places to which todays innovations will lead.  And when its time to relax, few cities of its size can compare in the variety and quality of cultural and recreational events available here.  Above all, the citys primary trait may be perseverance.  Epitomized by the yearly collective slog through another snowy winter, this perseverance also manifests itself in the way Rochester has reinvented itself over the years.  Even today, as the city tries to chart its course through the 21st century, its people plunge forward with that same determination, carrying with them not just the hope, but the certainty that springtime will arrive and with it, growth.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Some of the distinctive skyline of Downtown, including the Kaiser Building and the Cathedral of Christ the Light.   Although Oakland is often overshadowed by the beautiful, hilly, and tourist-friendly San Francisco, lying just to the west across the bay, Oakland does offer beauty and highlights of its own, and yes, a few less-pleasant aspects as well.  Since the 1960s, Oakland has been a hub of radical culture, and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hells Angels.  Oaklands history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Amy Tan, and Maya Angelou; actors Meryl Streep, Mark Hamill, Bruce Lee, and Tom Hanks; architect Julia "Butterfly" Hill; classical conductor Calvin Simmons; rappers MC Hammer, 2Pac, Messy Marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences.  Oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history. For many visitors, the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown, especially if they are in town on business, or simply do not know where to start. The center of transportation by BART and by bus is there, if one wants to branch out. And it is as simple as walking in a direction from there, for the first few neighborhoods, since Old Oakland is along 10th Street, just west of Broadway. Just east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oaklands famous Chinatown, and that to get the real essence of "Chinatown," Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best bet. Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history, in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood.  The curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway, and come to Jack London Square. The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the citys waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore, even for locals. Its the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake authors residence, still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era.  Just west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is Uptown. In the evening it buzzes with art galleries, theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts. A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop. Its a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls, avant-garde performance art, and even an improv theater company. Uptown also has some of the best in the citys vintage architecture, like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters, as well as several restaurants.  North Oakland is a sweeping term, referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt. Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown. Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown, centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue, at and near 51st Street. Until the 1960s, a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood, it is now a much more diversified neighborhood, home to many restaurants, including some of the citys best Korean and Ethiopian establishments. Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge, a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes. It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles. Open-air markets, bookstores, and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland. South of Rockridge, and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue, a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill (Pill Hill) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills, houses and trees. Another of North Oaklands group of foodie spots, home to the citys single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others; cafes, ice cream, coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood. East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks. Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly, suburban sort of feel. The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name, a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue - both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget, be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening, either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time, by day or night.  West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century. It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past. Strangely, twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes. After the the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated there, and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands. With Loma Prieta in 1989, the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed, and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhoods original Victorian houses, and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood. Though there are a few draws for the traveler, West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation.</field>

		<field name="content">Pine County Courthouse, home to the George W. Sausen Law Library and miles and miles of red tape.   Pine City is your quintessential, American small-town but it surprisingly offers a lot for its size.  In recent years, the rural feel of the community has diminished some giving way to exurbia pushing outward from the Twin Cities.  That said, Pine City has held true to its sense of place and community and doesnt at all feel swallowed up by its large metropolitan neighbors to the south.  Pine City rests easily in the shadow of Minneapolis-St. Paul, sufficiently close for a quick side trip, sufficiently distant to enjoy a more tranquil existence.  Pine City is like an image that lingers in the American consciousness:  an oak-lined courthouse square.  Gazebos and band shells.  One-chair barber shops.  The town café, gossip for breakfast and meatloaf for lunch.  Its small-town, downtown life, as it was and as it remains.  The citys politics are split between liberal and conservative with a slight advantage to the liberals.  Carhardt is a popular brand worn on local, middle-aged men and its not uncommon to see fishing hooks attached to many of their hat bills.  The typical Pine Citian says "You bet" in place of "yes".  Yet, this is a place that mixes the true Up North with a surprising level of sophistication; after all, its an arts community.    While its the biggest city around it for miles--from North Branch to Cloquet, and from Mora to Rice Lake, Wis. (a very large geographic area)--its not a pious place and the people arent pretentious.  They show a fine display of "Minnesota Nice" and are eager to assist the tourist.  To get a deeper understanding of the city, one has to visit it.</field>

		<field name="content">Founded in 1846 and holding a economy in iron production throughout the Civil War, it is what essentially created the village. It was named a Federal Historic District in 1973. Prominance had faded since the foundry closed in 1911, but its notoriety locally in the antiquities trade is negligible in comparison to the sheer touristic appeal of the villiage.  Cold Spring enjoys the temperate climate, but you should be aware that bad weather breaks on the mountains, as such you can enjoy 260+ days of sunshine a year, as well as the appropriately impressive thunder storm. To hear the echoes roll through the valley is really something! However, if you will be hiking, water is a must. The trees are appropriately shady, but you can go for miles in the mountains.   The tourist information booth is downtown by the river, on the east-side of the tracks. They also house two bathrooms behind them, which are usually clean.  There are several denominations in the area, specifically in Cold Spring are the Catholic church, near the river, The Episcopalian church on Main Street which is next to the traffic light, the Presbyterian church up one street from the Episcopalian, the Methodist church near the School, and the Baptist church which famously only has a handful of members and shares its priest. They have been a new marketing strategy as the Church on the Hill they are also the famous divide between Nelsonville and Cold Spring.</field>

		<field name="content">The Willamette River runs by Downtown Portland   Portland is the largest city lying between  San Francisco  and  Seattle , but when compared to those cities, Portlands environment is not as fast-paced. It hasnt yet developed to the point of being overwhelming. Instead, it has a more laid-back, small-city feel.  That being said, nearly 600,000 people live in Portland proper, and many more live in the suburbs. As such, Portland has its fair share of amenities, including an impressive music and arts scene and one of the largest collections of zine and independent publishers of any city in the nation. Its relatively large population also means it has some of the worst traffic congestion in the American West, a fairly high cost of living relative to wages, and chronic underemployment.  The city has a lovely blend of historic and modern architecture and many lush parks to poke your toes into. Forest Park and Washington Park in the hills west of Downtown offer a variety of plants, trails, and wildlife near the city. Vistas of Mount Hood and the Willamette River, stately Douglas-fir trees (Oregons official state tree), and roses and trees at every turn give the city stunning seasonal color.  Environmentally friendly practices, such as recycling and an extensive public transportation system, are part of the culture and fuel many progressive city planning practices. Portland metro, like all Oregon urban centers, is surrounded by an urban growth boundary. This keeps sprawl in check and helps to make Portland a relatively compact city. Unlike most similarly sized metropolitan areas in the country, you can drive about 15 mi (24 km) from Downtown in just about any direction and be out in the countryside.  Portland is a very fun and welcoming city for LGBT travelers. It has one of the largest and most integrated gay and lesbian communities in the United States, supported by two major LGBT publications and other queer-friendly media.</field>

		<field name="content">Dorchester (Dot) is the largest geographic and most populated neighborhood in the city of Boston. Home to Dot Ave., it is also Bostons most diverse neighborhood, with large pockets of African Americans, Irish, Vietnamese, Caribbean, and South and Central American residents. In recent years, the neighborhood has seen an influx of young working professionals, working artists (in areas like Lower Mills, Peabody Square, and Savin Hill), and a growing GLBT community along Dorchester Avenue, while its still predominantly a working-class neighborhood and a thriving center of immigration.   Although the JFK Presidential Library is in the neighborhood, Dorchester is generally not seen as a tourist destination. But if you are adventurous and would like to see a truly authentic neighborhood of Boston, it is the place. Generally the areas along Dorchester Ave. (serviced by the Ashmont branch of the red line subway) are your best bet to experience Dorchesters multi-cultural communities. Enjoy food at one of the many Vietnamese Restaurants in Fields Corner or many of the other Haitian, Jamaican, Central American, or Soul Food eateries along Dot Ave. Later, grab a drink at Dbar, Blarney Stone, Tavola Pizza, Ashmont Grill, or C.F. Donovans or watch your favorite Gaelic football team over a few beers at The Banshee.  Mattapan is also included in this article. Historically a section of neighboring Dorchester, Mattapan became a part of Boston when Dorchester was annexed in 1870. Predominantly residential, Mattapan is a mix of public housing, small apartment buildings, single-family houses, and two- and three-family houses (known locally as "Three-Deckers" or "Triple-Deckers"). Blue Hill Avenue and Mattapan Square, where Blue Hill Avenue, River Street, and Cummins Highway meet, are the commercial heart of the neighborhood, home to banks, law offices, restaurants, and retail shops. Mattapan now has the largest Haitian community in Massachusetts, and is also largely made up of African Americans and immigrants from other Caribbean countries.  Hyde Park is the southernmost neighborhood of Boston. It is home to a diverse range of people, housing types and social groups. It is an urban location with suburban characteristics.</field>

		<field name="content">As early as 1845 the Hudsons Bay Company, based at Fort Victoria, had posted a notice of possession on San Juan Island. In 1851 it established a salmon-curing station there and, two years later, a sheep ranch called Belle Vue Farm. About the same time, the Territorial Legislature of Oregon (which then included the present State of Washington) declared San Juan Island to be within its territorial limits, and in January 1853 incorporated it into Island County. In March 1853, Washington Territory having been created, San Juan Island was attached to Whatcom, its northernmost county.   By 1859 there were about 18 Americans on San Juan Island. They were settled on redemption claims which they expected the U.S. Government to recognize as valid, but which the British considered illegal. That crisis came on June 15, 1859, when an American settler named Lyman Cutlar shot and killed a pig belonging to the Hudsons Bay Company because it was rooting in his garden. When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American citizens drew up a petition requesting U.S. military protection. The subsequent military buildup caused each side to keep adding more military to the island. When word of the crisis reached Washington, officials there were shocked that the simple action of an irate farmer had grown into an explosive international incident. President James Buchanan sent Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, commanding general of the U.S. Army, to investigate and try to contain the affair. He was able to get both sides, the British and the American to agree to joint military occupation until the issue could be settled.  San Juan Island remained under joint military occupation for the next 12 years. In 1871, when Great Britain and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington, the San Juan question was referred to Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany for settlement. The kaiser referred the issue to a three-man arbitration commission who met for nearly a year in Geneva. On October 21, 1872, the commission, through the kaiser, ruled in favor of the United States, establishing the boundary line through Haro Strait. Thus the San Juan Islands became American possessions and the final boundary between Canada and the United States was set.   Many of San Juan Islands roads trace sheep runs cut by Hudsons Bay Company workers. They were led, in part, by Fort Victoria Chief Factor and colonial Gov. James Douglas, from 1853 to 1859. Many of the workers were Cowichan Indians from Vancouver Island.</field>

It was founded in 1849 and there are many reminders of the history of the city including Sutters Fort, Old Sacramento, and remnants of the original ground level of Sacramento. It experienced explosive growth when gold was discovered in 1848 in nearby  Coloma, California , and the gold rush that followed was the largest human migration in history. Currently it has a population of 490,000 in the city and over two million in the metropolitan area.   The pace of life is somewhat slower than in other large Californian cities, and the people are generally warm and friendly. According to Time magazine Sacramento is the most diverse city in the USA. The city used to be an affordable place, but it suffered from the San Francisco Bay Areas dot com rise and fall, and real estate went from undervalued to overvalued.  The market is correcting itself so property values in most neighboorhoods have leveled off while others are dropping to more reasonable valuations.</field>

		<field name="content">Wyoming is a great place to discover the American West. With many unspoiled mountain vistas, vast blue skies and the awe-inspiring scenery of the high plains and Rocky Mountains, Wyoming offers much of what travelers to this region seek. Unlike other states in the Rockies, Wyomings demographic growth has been restricted to a few areas of the state where mineral extraction has expanded in the recent past. While mining and drilling have expanded recently (and very notably in some regions), Wyoming is still relatively unspoiled compared to other parts of the region.    Wyoming is the least populated U.S. state, with slightly more than half a million residents, the majority of whom cluster into a handful of cities and towns. Of these,  Cheyenne  and  Casper  are the largest and are home to more than a quarter of the states citizens. For visitors, this means that the distance between towns is often vast, requiring more planning and self-sufficiency than travel in more densely populated parts of the country. It also means that travelers will have the chance to experience first hand the feeling of being all alone in vast, wide-open spaces.   The state offers a wealth of outdoor recreation and sightseeing opportunities, including the nations  first national park , mountain ranges, vast forests, crystal-clear rivers and wilderness areas. The states attractions include archaeological treasures, such as those at Castle Gardens in central Wyoming, as well as ghost towns dating from the early frontier days (Atlantic City) to the 1980s. Native American culture has left a significant mark on the state and region. The Wind River reservation, home to the Arapahoe and Shoshone tribes, offer visitors excellent opportunities to experience contemporary Native American culture and to learn about the past.   Nearly half of the state is designated as public land, so visitors will not lack for opportunities to get out and experience wide open spaces. As visitors might expect, Wyomings economy is closely tied to these public lands, used for mineral extraction, tourism and ranching, making land-use policy one of the states most hotly debated issues.</field>

		<field name="content">Three Mile campground on Isle Royale   Isle Royale is currently a wilderness preserve first, a sanctuary for those seeking to experience it second, and a travel destination third.  Although it accommodates all of these uses, thats the order of priority they take.  So wildlife gets the run of the island, and human visitors are generally restricted to established trails and accessible lakes, with  leave-no-trace camping  protocols in effect.  Modern conveniences and comforts are very limited; away from the small ports on either end of the island, "running water" means "a creek", and only "outhouse" pit toilets are available. (Many of the more accessible ones are stocked with toilet paper, but bring your own or be prepared to improvise.)  Lake Superior winters close the park from November through mid-April, with limited access before Memorial Day and after Labor Day; Isle Royale is the only U.S. National Park Service park to shut down altogether for the winter.  Because of this, along with its geographic isolation and challenging ruggedness, it receives fewer visitors in a year (17,500 in 2005) than many national parks endure in a day.  Those visitors stay a remarkable average of 4-5 days each (even counting day-trippers), but it still has one of the lowest visitors-per-square-mile figures outside of the huge  Alaskan parks .  Which is, of course, a large part of its appeal.  And it leaves these visitors wanting more with the NPSs highest return-visit rate.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Sonora was originally founded as a gold mining camp by white settlers from back east. Gold had been discovered in Woods Creek, initially in the summer of 1848 near what is now Jamestown.  The name Sonora was derived from the Mexican workers the whites employed at slave-like wages to work their mines.  The City of Sonora was incorporated in 1851 by whites, not Mexicans, primarily as a means of creating a badly-needed hospital.  Many miners were sick, and dying, mainly from scurvy, mainly white miners who never learnt the importance of fresh vegetables and fruits in their diets. Sonora became the business center (and county seat of Tuolumne County) for the mines around the county and, indeed, for the entire Southern Mines region south of Placerville. When the placer mines began to give out in the 1860s, Sonora survived in part because it had become a business center.  It also had what were known as "pocket" mines--underground deposits of highly concentrated gold.  Such pocket mines are distinguished from ordinary quartz mines, in which the gold is much less concentrated and requires much work and technology to mine, and which were not profitable until the 1880s when better mining technology had been developed.</field>

Despite east coast urban sprawl, there is still both gently-developed oceanside territory and farmland here.  The origin of the name (pronounced "road island") is debatable.  It is either derived from the name Roode Eylandt given to it by Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, because of its red clay, or because Block Island reminded the Italian navigator Giovanni Verrazano of the Greek Island of Rhodes, and subsequent explorers became confused and renamed Aquidneck Island Rhode Island.  The states population is just over a million, so even though it is the smallest state in the U.S., it is ranked 43rd in population.</field>

As of 2004, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau is 36,632. Dunedin is home to several beaches, including Dunedin Causeway, Honeymoon Island, and Caladesi Island State Park, which is consistently rated among the best beaches in the world. Dunedin is one of the few open waterfront communities from Sarasota to Cedar Key where buildings do not completely obscure the view of the Intercoastal Waterway and the Gulf of Mexico beyond; a 1-mile stretch of Edgewater Drive (also known as Alternate US 19) south of downtown offers views of St. Joseph Sound, Clearwater Beach, and Caladesi Island. Downtown Clearwater and Clearwater Beach are a six mile drive down Edgewater.  The quaint, but thriving downtown business district is striking in comparison to neighboring Florida communities for its absence of commercial signage and corporate franchise restaurants and retail stores. The Pinellas Trail, a 39-mile long bicycle and pedestrian trail that traverses all of Pinellas County, bisects downtown Dunedin. Bicyclists are a common sight in the business district.  Since 1977, Dunedin is the spring training home of the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the class-A Minor League Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League. Dunedin is one of the smallest communities used by Major League spring training teams. Dunedin Stadium is situated next to the Dunedin Public Library--a few blocks south of downtown on Douglas Avenue--and is just two blocks east of Edgewater Drive.</field>

The town was founded in 1819 to support the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and later was incorporated in 1851. The adjacent town of Carrboro was settled in the 1880s around a spur rail line built to serve the university. The town is named for Julian Carr, who purchased a local cotton mill and installed electricity in the town. Today, the town is home to the Weaver Street Market (a local co-op), a popular farmers market, and a bunch of festivals.  Like much of the rest of the Piedmont, the landscape is hilly and heavily wooded, becoming very lush and green in the summer months. While much of North Carolina is conservative, Chapel Hill is fairly liberal in comparison. Although legend says that the town became liberal when a Union general married former UNC President Swain’s daughter, Chapel Hill’s liberal politics are similar to many US college towns and are bolstered by nearby Carrboro, which is known for being a bastion of liberalism in the state. It is not uncommon to see a protest in Chapel Hill and/or on the university campus for various liberal causes, with the traditional locus of this being the square in front of the post office on Franklin Street across from the campus.</field>

With roots dating back to the Pre-Revolutionary War period, Haworth began as a farming community, but over time developed into a residential suburb within easy commuting distance of New York City.  Today Haworth covers an area of 2.2 square miles, and is home to approximately 3,390 residents. Haworth residents enjoy many benefits of suburban living – excellent schools, a thriving small town commercial center, two excellent golf courses, beautiful parks and recreational facilities.  It’s a quiet town, full of small-town atmosphere and tree-lined beauty, which belies the fact that it’s close enough to New York City to be a suburb. The town boasts an excellent local school, Haworth Public School, with grades kindergarten through 8th . For high school, students attend the equally top-notch Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest. Haworth’s downtown area is small, but storefronts still offer everything from hardware to haircuts. Haworth has two banks, three houses of worship, and what may be the friendliest post office in Bergen County.        Haworth Duck Pond</field>

		<field name="content">A major city located on the Ohio River in North Central Kentucky across from Southern Indiana, Louisville exists at the confluence of Southern and Midwestern attitudes and cultures. Known historically as the Gateway to the South, Louisville has long been a transportation center for the region. Other local nicknames include River City and Derby City, in addition to the myriad of ways the name can be pronounced, depending on ones accent. More or less any pronunciation is acceptable except Lewis, an error which will not offend anyone but definitely marks one as an out-of-towner. While it only borders on the region, tourists will probably find a bit of the famous Southern hospitality here, along with its varied cuisine and a relaxed attitude toward life. The city also boasts a vibrant arts and music scene and a world-class municipal parks system.  Louisvilles biggest draw are the horse races at Churchill Downs (with the famous Kentucky Derby always the first Saturday in May), but the city is making a concerted effort to draw tourists year round. The architecture in Old Louisville and the Highlands is one-of-a-kind, and the people are very friendly.  The Downtown, Old Louisville, Highlands, and Frankfort Avenue areas are walkable and it is possible to take the city bus between one or all four without much difficulty, with a downtown hotel as base. Outside of this part of town though, you will almost certainly need a car.  Aside from Downtown, a must-see for many is the Highlands shopping district, on Bardstown Road roughly from Broadway to the Douglass Loop. Often described as "bohemian", it includes art galleries, bars, coffeehouses, midrange to upscale restaurants, and is ideally navigated by foot or bike. You can meet some locals on the sidewalks without much trouble, if you are interested. The street life here is particularly active on weekends when the weather is warm.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Halfway between  Grand Junction  and  Montrose , Delta is located in an irrigated desert valley surrounded by mountains. It is the county seat for Delta County, and was named for its location on the delta of the Uncompahgre River. If you blow through town on Hwy 50, you are missing a quaint little community with a rich heritage and several sights worth seeing.   The 19th century history of the Uncompahgre Valley is largely a rocky tale of strained race relations between white settlers and the Tabeguache branch of the Ute nation, who called the valley home.   Delta was originally established as a trading post at the confluence of the the Uncompahgre and Gunnison Rivers (the latter alternately called the Uncompahgre and Blue or the Eagle Tail). Built in 1828 by Antoine Robidoux, Fort Uncompahgre was neutral ground used by soldiers, traders, trappers and Native Americans.  The fort lasted for 18 years and eventually came to a tragic end.   In September 1844, most of the trading posts occupants were killed in an attack by the Ute, sparked by a regional dispute that took place in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico .  The Utes fought a rear guard action for the next 40 years, with intermittent settler encroachments on their lands. The U.S. further exacerbated the problem by trying to force the Utes to abandon their nomadic lifestyle and become farmers. The head of the governments Indian Agency, Nathan Cook Meeker, approached the Utes with a mixture of arrogance and hostility. He plowed up a Ute horse-racing track to plant a field, and later engaged in a fist fight with the owner of the race track. In 1879, Meeker telegraphed for military assistance, and the Federal government responded with around 200 soldiers to police the area. The situation was handled with mutual mistrust on both sides, and several skirmishes occurred. The crisis culminated with the Utes killing several whites at the Indian Agency (including Meeker) and launching the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to  Utah , and  Southwestern Colorado , near  Cortez .  The Uncompahgre Reservation was opened to settlers in the fall of 1881.  George A. Crawford, founder of Grand Junction, secured a townsite from W. C. Stephens. The Uncompahgre Town and Improvement Company was established, incorporating as Delta in 1882. It was named as the county seat the following year.  The areas economy relied primarily on orchards and ranching, industries which continue to this day.   In the 20th century, the residents of Delta initiated reconciliation efforts with the Utes, founding the Ute Council Tree Pow Wow Cultural Festival    in 1992. Located in Confluence Park at a 200 year old cottonwood tree, the council tree was the traditional gathering place and mediation spot for the Utes. The three branches of the Ute nation gather each September and celebrate with dancing, singing, Native American artwork and a reconstructed tee pee village.   Deltans further celebrate their pioneer heritage with a reconstruction of Fort Uncompaghre   , a living history museum that features authentically dressed interpreters who guide you through the fort.   Delta has paleontological wonders, as well. In 1971, locals discovered dinosaur bones at nearby Dry Mesa. Twenty-three genera of Jurassic-era dinosaurs have been found in the quarry, including brachiosaurs, supersauruses and ultrasauruses. The Dry Mesa Quarry is amongst the most diverse fossil beds in  North America .   In the 1990s, grape growers discovered the areas potential for raising white wine varietals, and Colorados wine industry migrated south from Grand Junction and  Palisade . The West Elks American Viticultural Area was formed in 2001. Ranging from 5,400 feet (1646 m) to 6,400 feet (1951 m) above sea level, West Elks comprises some of the highest vineyards in the world.   Today, Delta is a hub for tourism and recreation, including camping, hiking, fishing, hunting and mountain bike riding. Delta is highly cognizant of preserving its history. The town has over 20 beautiful murals depicting its fruit orchards and other past times. There are several buildings in town on the National Historic Register, including the Egyptian Theater, an "Egyptian Revival" art deco movie house from the 1920s.</field>

This is a good thing in the sense that if you are a friendly person who is willing to openly converse in a jovial manner, you will have no problem meeting like-minded friendly people and your stay in Graham will be a happy and memorable one.  Graham, not unlike many small communities in Texas, is known for its friendly citizens and a certain "down home" Texas-Americana feel.  Outsiders are often surprised (and oddly enough, sometimes offended) at the amount of hellos, howdys, and hat tips a person may receive for merely crossing paths with a local.  If it gets weird, and indeed it might, just roll with it, return the gesture, and be friendly.</field>

		<field name="content">View from Lovers Point   Monterey    is one of the more beautiful coastal cities of  California  and can make for a great two day trip for those visiting  San Francisco  or a weekend getaway for California natives.  It was originally the state capital of  California , and has more historic buildings in its downtown than any other city west of Santa Fe. Today it is best known for its beautiful coastline, its world-class aquarium and from the many John Steinbeck novels set there, including Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat.  Rugged terrain and vicious Pacific currents made much of the California coast virtually unexplorable to European ships.  After a disastrous attempt to explore this new territory by sea, Spanish missionaries in Mexico launched a series of overland expeditions from San Diego.  Monterey was established in 1770 by Father Junipero Serra and soon became a Spanish military base with a small fort or "presidio" located near a calm harbor that could provide shelter to supply ships.  The military presence eventually gave way to a thriving commercial trade that brought in many enterprising foreign merchants.   Once Mexico gained its independence from Spain, Monterey became the capital of Alta California under Mexican rule. From this era come many classic stories of flirtation, fashion, and politics in the Mexican colonial era. Lands once owned by the government began to come into private hands, and local families began to consolidate their property and power into business enterprises based on the ranches or "ranchos," where they raised cattle or invented the famous Monterey Jack cheese.  Monterey soon fell under American power in the Mexican-American War and remained the capital of the territory. A delegation of writers drafted the constitution which marked the entrance of the State of California into the United States of America. This era saw the mass northward migration of ambitious people in search of gold, which led to a near desertion of the town. Monterey soon recovered, however, and today is known for its magnificent natural beauty, world famous Aquarium, and temperate year-round climate.  The Monterey Peninsula has the largest population of sea otters on the California coast.  The abundance of marine wildlife visible from the shoreline is one of the primary attractions of the region.  Seals, sea lions, and sea otters are visible year-round, and migrating whales are commonly seen in the fall and spring months.  Alvarado Street serves as downtown Montereys "main drag." It has superb restaurants, a selection of bars, and unique shops.</field>

		<field name="content">People had big dreams for Toledo. The location of the city was set on some of the most inhospitable land in the Midwest:  the Great Black Swamp. Early white settlers spent years digging drainage ditches through the swamp, and lining them with clay tiles--when they were not catching mosquito-borne diseases. Michigan and Ohio briefly went to war (no one was killed) over the land. By an act of Congress, Ohio was awarded Toledo, while Michigan received the Upper Peninsula. Later settlers came over from Eastern Europe, or up from down south, to work on the Erie Canal, and still later to work in local factories that made early automobiles and auto parts.  Promenade Park   Today, Toledo is a city of 315,000 with a big local university, an independent daily newspaper, and historic buildings downtown, some of which have been turned into artists lofts. Toledo is also home to the legendary Toledo Mud Hens minor league baseball team. They play in the Fifth Third Field in downtown Toledo. Near downtown, the Old West End is a beautiful neighborhood of Victorian mansions, and is where the world-class Toledo Museum of Art and its new glass museum can be found. A world-class Toledo Zoo is a few miles to the south. In the north end, there is the Polish Village where it is common to see storefronts written in Polish. The food in Toledo is worth stopping for. As well as the many diners in the area, many ethnic eateries should not be missed, including Tony Packos famous Hungarian hot dogs, Hungarian baked goods, classy Middle Eastern places such as the Beirut, and delicious Indian cuisine from the Tandoor.  True or not, Toledo likes to think that it has the most restaurants per capita in the entire country.</field>

Author William Least Heat-Moon once wrote about the city, "If youre ever looking for the most hidden statehouse in America, look no farther than Frankfort." The river, whose main course runs from southeast to northwest, makes a rough S-curve through the city, dividing it into four major parts:  Downtown — The historic business district, in the valley and north of the river (which flows east-west at this particular point). This region of Frankfort is characterized by charismatic old fashioned antebellum style buildings. shops, cafes, restaurants and museums.  South Frankfort — Home to the State Capitol, in the valley and south of the river. The governors mansion and capitol are surrounded by floral gardens and lawns.  East Side Frankfort and West Side Frankfort —  Commonly referred to as the "sides" of town. The more modern areas on either side of the valley, with more shopping options.The "West side" of town has traditionally had the most concentration of modern stores, restaurants and hotels. However, companies have recently started to put more focus on the East side, with new shopping complexes, restaurants and attractions being completed monthly. The East side is also home to many traditional mexican restaurants.</field>

It is known for being home to the main campus of the University of Maryland, a large Six Flags amusement park, the Washington Redskins, and a major NASA facility. One will sometimes hear it abbreviated "P.G.", but visitors are probably better off avoiding the term, which irritates some county residents.  The county is very diverse, both ethnically and economically. Inside the Beltway, there is a pretty clear division between Northern P.G. County (northeast of D.C.) and Southern P.G. County (southeast of D.C.). The former is significantly more densely populated and wealthy than the latter, which has much in common with the even poorer neighboring areas in  southeastern D.C. .  Outside the Beltway, residents of areas like  Laurel ,  Bowie  and  Upper Marlboro  sometimes feel like they belong more in neighboring counties than in "P.G."</field>

		<field name="content">Situated on a river bluff with excellent natural resources and easy river access, the area has been settled since prehistory, with artifacts and burial mounds showing settlement as far back as 10,000 B.C. Peoria was first settled by French explorers in 1680 and is one of the oldest continuously-occupied European settlements in what is now Illinois. Thanks to its position on the Illinois River, Peoria enjoyed comfortable growth from shipping business in the 1800s and early 1900s. Like  Muncie  in  Indiana , it became known as an Average American Town, leading to the famous phrase, used by Jack Benny as a radio punchline (and the Nixon administration for political spin): "Will it play in Peoria?"   Residents may rankle at the implied lack of sophistication in the phrase; right or wrong, they take fierce pride in what their city has to offer, and they see the only differences between their city and  Chicago  as being size and cost-of-living. Today, most of Peorias economy revolves around Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, and business conventions. Illinois high school sports tournaments are also a major draw for visitors. Famous natives include Richard Pryor, for whom a street leading from town to the airport is named, and Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique.  The Peoria Area Convention and Visitors Bureau can help groups and individuals plan an itinerary in Peoria.</field>

Pennock left the expedition, supposedly  to secure more funding, and never returned. For much of the history of this area the larger settlements were those on the opposite side of Kachemak Bay. The completion of the Sterling Highway provided road access in 1951, causing Homer to begin expanding and overshadowing its neighbors across the water. The 1964 Good Friday Earthquake severely damaged the Homer Spit, causing portions of it to sink about six feet, destroying the road as well as the surrounding habitat, now known as "Mud Bay." The US Army Corps of Engineers reconstructed the first few miles of the Spit, giving it its present appearance.</field>

		<field name="content">The blues; the famous Mississippi Delta juke joints. This section of the country is dirt poor economically, but the birthplace of the blues has more culture than some entire U.S. states. Modern American music—and hence modern music the world over—traces its routes right back here, to the old juke joints of Mississippi. These rural bars, in cinder-block or wood structures just about as poor as their customers, were where black Mississipians would escape from their hard lives of hard work with a good dose of music, alcohol, back-room gambling, the occasional fight, and cavorting with some members of the opposite sex. The word juke is believed to come from the Gullah word joog for rowdy—and it was these rowdy run-down joints that bred the music that was the soul of black America and would become the inspiration to the world.  The juke joints are a living tradition right up to this day. But in the past ten years or so, they have been closing left and right, leaving only a handful of the old original rural juke joints, with closings common in the towns as well. The reasons? First is the economy—the state of things has been so bad, for a long enough time, where the Delta suffers from serious depopulation, and hence a decreasing base of customers. Second is the trend among the regions youth towards listening to rap from the big cities, casting off the tradition of guitars and harmonicas. Third are the new casinos, which lure away the old patrons with free music, free drinks, and legal venues for gambling. Unable to compete with that, the holdout juke joints have turned to "sexy nights" with strippers, less expensive live bands and more cheap DJs, and even a little tourism promotion with the help of blues lovers worldwide. Nonetheless, come with the full knowledge that this culture is critically endangered, and that the blues may find themselves relegated to the less authentic, more packaged version up on Beale St in  Memphis  or the North Side blues clubs of  Chicago .</field>

It is normally has much less people than Isle of Palms beach, which is normally very busy. On Summer mornings, there are often many dogs running around off a leash. The beach is is very wide, and is great for biking and walking. It has no lifeguards and the water is a little more dangerous than Isle of Palms beachs water, so it isnt the best for swimming. It is hardly commercialized at all.</field>

Even though it shaped up to be one of the motor capitals of the world from 1900 to 1912, it failed due to one company making bad financial decisions and the other to a fire on its plant. However, J. Wallace Page invented the first successful wire fence, making Adrian known from the late 1800s to the early 1900s as the fence capital of the world with one of the worlds first fencing manufacturers.</field>

Its efficient layout means it is also easy to navigate and not as delay-prone as many other hub airports. The airport has many international nonstop services to North America, South America, Latin and Central America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.  On the domestic side, Hartsfieldndash;Jackson is one large building separated into South Terminal (Delta and its partners) and North Terminal (all other airlines), connected by a central Atrium with a smattering of restaurants. The security line is through the Atrium, and because it is centralized, is usually fast; you can  check current wait times online . A new international terminal on the opposite end of the airport is used for all arriving and departing international flights.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">In November of 1868, the rails of the Union Pacific Railroad reached the location of what is now known as North Platte.  Situated between the North and South Platte rivers, just west of the confluence, the town was named by a flip of a coin to determine between North Platte and South Platte.  North Platte was incorporated as a city in 1873.  In 1882, Col. Wm. F. Cody, known to the world as "Buffalo Bill", responded to the calls of local civic leaders and produced an Independence Day celebration known as the "Old Glory Blowout".  He later developed this into his famed Wild West Show which toured throughout the world.  The home he built while living in North Platte, known as Scouts Rest Ranch, is now a state historical park and is open to tour.  North Platte could have gone the way of many small towns in rural Nebraska, becoming a sleepy backwater, except for native Bill Jeffers.  Jeffers rose from a "call boy" for Union Pacific, to become president of the railroad.  He chose his home town of North Platte to build a reclassification yard.  Union Pacifics Bailey Yard is now the largest railroad classification yard in the world.  Nearly 4,000 employees service more than 150 trains per day, totaling nearly 15,000 rail cars.  During World War II, North Platte became famous for the North Platte Canteen.  Volunteers met in early December 1941 at the Depot to greet what they thought was a train load of local troops headed for war.  When the train stopped, it turned out to be carrying boys from Kansas instead of North Platte.  After they got over their disappointment, townspeople offered all of the goodies they had collected to the Kansas boys.  From this humble beginning, on Christmas day 1941, the North Platte Canteen opened its doors.  For the next 52 months, volunteers met every single troop train that came through town, day or night.  By April 1, 1946, this all-volunteer effort had served more than 6.5 million service personnel.</field>

		<field name="content">:"Walt Disney World is a tribute to the philosophy and life of Walter Elias Disney... and to the talents, the dedication, and the loyalty of the entire Disney organization that made Walt Disneys dream come true. May Walt Disney World bring Joy and Inspiration and New Knowledge to all who come to this happy place... a Magic Kingdom where the young at heart of all ages can laugh and play and learn mdash; together." mdash; Roy O. Disney, October 25, 1971  The Magic Kingdom is the "main" park at Walt Disney World, based on the original  Disneyland  in Anaheim, California, and the one most people think of first when they think of Walt Disney World.  It is organized around the central landmark of Cinderella Castle, with six themed "lands" arrayed around a central hub. Starting from the main entrance and going clockwise around Cinderella Castle, the lands are Main Street U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.  Of the four Walt Disney World theme parks, the Magic Kingdom is the oldest, most popular, and the most child-friendly, although many adults love the escapism as well. Adult visitors who do not enjoy rides such as "its a small world" where you sit in vehicles that take you in a circle through a tunnel, and listen to childlike delight and screams, may want to visit  Epcot  or  Hollywood Studios  instead.  Though the FastPass system works well, it is not available for all attractions, and lines can be endless but always keep moving.  Food and merchandise can be pricey, but not too bad considering where you are.  Plan accordingly for a trip and expect to spend at least $100 per person for a visit.  Despite it all, most people would agree that the lines, the crowds, and the prices are worth it for the magical Disney experience that makes all adults "children", if even only for a day.</field>

		<field name="content">:"I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty. Call the child innocence. The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be. In my work I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living; showing it that laughter is healthy; showing it that the human species, although happily ridiculous at times, is still reaching for the stars." mdash; Walt Disney   The most important thing to understand about the Walt Disney World Resort is that it was designed to be fun for everyone.  Dont make the mistake of staying away just because you dont have kids.  Singles and couples without children who think a Walt Disney World vacation is just for kids ignore the many "adult" entertainments available throughout the resort.  Gourmands, sun-worshippers, world travelers, thrill-seekers, comedy-lovers, film devotees, sports fans, club-hoppers, and history buffs will all find plenty of ways to have a great time.  Of course, if you do have kids, the best part of your Walt Disney World vacation is in experiencing the parks through their eyes.  That is when you really understand Walt Disneys vision of a place where kids and parents can have fun together.  Walt Disney World is enormous, a multi-day resort destination.  Each of its four theme parks is big enough to occupy visitors for a full day (and often two, depending on crowds).  Unless you live nearby, four days is considered the bare minimum length of visit to even begin to experience the resort; some people stay as long as two weeks and still bypass some attractions.  Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families.  The "typical" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home.  There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of "going to Disney World".  Everything at Walt Disney World is carefully constructed and choreographed to maintain your perceptions of visiting an idealized world.  Company jargon frames every aspect of customer service as part of the "show": employees are "cast members", visitors are "guests", and every prop and costume must be completely "in-character" while "on-stage" (visible to guests).  Disney prides themselves on customer service and friendliness.  You will never find garbage lying in the streets or bathrooms that are too dirty, and anything that is damaged is either removed or fixed immediately. The streets are almost sparkling and the buildings look brand new no matter what time of the day or year you are there.  While some people find this attention to detail cloying and artificial, the vast majority of visitors are happy to immerse themselves in this relaxing, carefree environment.  Even so, the realities of Walt Disney World can be stark: long lines, sweltering heat, rude guests, and expensive merchandise are common.  There are ways to avoid the worst elements (namely by carefully choosing when to visit) and customer service is almost universally impeccable, even (or perhaps especially) when things go wrong.  Many first-time visitors try to do too much during their stay.  Unless crowds are unusually small, this is a sure-fire recipe for burnout and exhaustion.  You need to have a basic schedule in mind, but you should remain flexible in order to account for closed rides, full restaurants, special events, and just changing your mind.  If the crowds get too heavy or the weather gets too hot, smart guests staying on-site head back to their hotels to relax, grab a snack, or take a swim, then return later in the day.  Trying to adhere to a rigid schedule will only frustrate you and your family, and youre not going to Walt Disney World to get frustrated, are you?  With some careful basic planning, an open mind, and a cheerful attitude, a visit to Walt Disney World can be whatever you want it to be: fulfilling, exciting, relaxing, enlightening, or just plain fun.  Whatever you chose to do, your visit is guaranteed to be an experience, in every sense of the wordmdash;one youll never forget.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Black Hills National Forest is public land owned by the federal US government and operated by the US forest service.   The Black Hills national forest is one of the most road-built national forests in the country. Due to the odd history of South Dakota, the forest service land is actually patchworked in and out with private land, state highways, forest service roads, and etc all through the area.   Within the federal land are several cities, such as  Deadwood ,  Lead , and  Custer . On the edge of the Black Hills are towns such as  Spearfish ,  Hot Springs , and  Rapid City .  The Black Hills of  South Dakota  are a lone series of mountains in the middle of the Great Plains. The nearest rocky mountains, the Bighorn Mountains, are about one hundred miles to the west. The nearest mountains to the east or south are several thousand miles away. It was formed by unknown means when some kind of uplift occurred many millions of years ago.   The Black Hills are possibly named black because of the Ponderosa Pine trees that grow there; young trees have black bark that turns orange as the trees mature.   The Black Hills are sacred to Lakota people and were a refuge during harsh seasons on the plains. The hills unique ecosystem also provided many plants not found on the prairies that could be used for foodmaking or medicine. Nowadays the Lakota live mostly on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation a few miles to the south.   The Hills unique formation of limestone rocks being shifted by the uplift, and then eroded and deposited-upon by water, make wonderful conditions for caves to form, and the area is dotted with many that you can visit. The federal government has taken over two of these via the National Park Service; Wind Cave and Jewel Cave. You can go on guided tours through these. There are several commercial caves owned privately by companies that also give tours.   Tourism is a big business in the Black Hills. In summer the temperatures rise and tourists flood in for a variety of reasons. Thus there are many touristy type shops, restaurants, casinos and so forth usually with a western theme, banking on the Wild West image of Deadwood and the surrounding area.   There are also lots of mountain climbers, and therefore several mountain climbing schools and equipment supply shops. Devils Tower which is a famous climbing destination lies a few hours to the West of the area in Wyoming.   The hills are mostly populated lower income white people, farmers and ranchers, and Indians, but in recent years lots of people from California, driven out by high land prices, have invaded the area. Many of the old citizens have sold their land to incoming Californians for a good price and have moved farther from the Hills.</field>

In 1950, the US Army transferred Dr. Werner von Braun and his team of German rocket scientists to Redstone Arsenal. Within a decade, the city became a center for rocket design and construction. In 1960, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center, which has played a significant role in the Redstone (named after Redstone Arsenal), Gemini, and Apollo manned space programs.   Today, the city continues to be a center for missile defense and aerospace technologies, with companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman having major operations here. Cummings Research Park, the second largest research park in the country, is home to many of these companies.   According to the Census Bureau 2005 estimates, Huntsville is home to 166,313 residents. The Huntsville metro area, with 517,006 residents, is the third largest in Alabama, after  Birmingham  and  Mobile . Madison, Athens, Decatur, and a number of smaller cities are generally considered part of the Huntsville metro area.</field>

		<field name="content">Compared to its larger neighbors  Orcas Island  and  San Juan Island , Lopez has a more bucolic charm. It is relatively flat and most of it remains quite undeveloped. This is a conscious decision by local residents, who prefer a rural lifestyle, even if it means forgoing modern conveniences such as widespread cellular phone service, and being underpopulated enough to be considered flyover space by the pilots at Whidbey Island Air Force Base. Many residents rely heavily on local agriculture, as the high prices at the local grocery store make it cost-prohibitive for many residents to eat imported food out of season.</field>

Ranchos de Taos is a small village south of Taos proper that is notable for a spectacularly scenic and much-photographed church.  Taos Pueblo is just north of town, an ancient American Indian community (and  UNESCO World Heritage Site ) in a particularly beautiful setting.  Taos Ski Valley, also known as Twining, is about 20 miles (30 km) north of town in the  Sangre de Cristo Mountains .  Finally, the Taos Box is a section of the nearby Rio Grande known for its superb whitewater.  Before setting out for an attraction, know exactly which Taos youre visiting; there are attractions outside Taos proper in Ranchos de Taos, Taos Pueblo and Taos Ski Valley, all of which are covered below with those for the town.</field>

		<field name="content">The Antelope Valley is an arid plateau located between the Tehachapi and San Gabriel Mountains.  It enjoys clear air and strong winds, and fantastic visibility.  While not everyone will appreciate the rugged beauty of the desert and the rugged mountains nearby, others find the scenery spectacular.  Dotting the landscape are the Antelope Valleys trademark Joshua Trees, which only grow in the Mojave Desert.  The Antelope Valley began as a community nearly a century ago.  Its original inudstries were agriculture and mining, and those persist to this day with boron and copper mining going on in the northern hills and carrots and onions growing in the outlying areas.  However, the region is now dominated by the aerospace industry, with the core work being done in and around either Air Force Plant 42 or Edwards Air Force Base.  Economically, the area is dominated by its two largest cities, Palmdale and Lancaster.  Between the two cities, a population of over 500,000 people call the Antelope Valley home.  Roughly half of the breadwinners in the area commute to jobs closer to the nearby urban center of Los Angeles, but the others work near where they live.  Attracted by affordable housing, clean air, and freedom from the crowding and congestion of the big city, the residents of the Antelope Valley (or "A.V." to the locals) also boast proximity to some interesting local attractions.</field>

		<field name="content">Knoxville sits nestled on the Tennessee River about an hour from the  Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Once called the scruffy little city, the downtown is undergoing a rapid renaissance as young people move into the lofts and apartments created from the factories and warehouses of another era.  On any evening of the week, throngs of residents and visitors can be seen at the sidewalk cafes, theaters, restaurants and night clubs along Gay Street and Market Square.  The University of Tennessee, with its 27,000 students, is within walking distance of the downtown, separated only by the Worlds Fair Park.  One can still see remnants of the 1982 Worlds Fair in the Sunsphere, a rising structure topped with a gold sphere which dots Knoxvilles skyline, however, most of the other structures from the Fair were removed to create a large city park which attracts families, students, and artists on weekends and sunny days. The Worlds Fair brought a lot of attention and development to the city, including high-rise office structures, and the four-star Hilton, Crowne Plaza and Marriott hotels.  Knoxville is home to the Womens Basketball Hall of Fame, but the city seems dominated by the University of Tennessee Volunteers (men only) and Lady Volunteers athletics. The basketball teams play in the 21,000+ seat Thompson Boling Arena, and the nationally recognized football team plays in Neyland Stadium, one of the largest on-campus stadiums in the world at 103,000 seating capacity. During the fall you will find plenty of orange in the foliage, but you will see Big Orange year round with the people of Knoxville.  The city is also the home or birthplace of a number of cultural figures, such as authors Cormac McCarthy, James Agee, and Alex Haley, and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who mentions the city in all of his films (remember the watch in Pulp Fiction?)  The Everly Brothers attended high school here and began performing on radio in Knoxville.  Dolly Parton began her career in Knoxville.  Senator Howard Baker, actor David Keith, film director Clarence Brown and opera singer Mary Costa are all from the Knoxville area.  Less culturally, actor and daredevil Johnny Knoxville is from the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Big Pine is one of the larger Keys, and is composed of an interface of two types of  limestone rock. Key Largo limestone, ancient fossilized reef tract, extends from Key Largo to Big Pine Key and then slides under (so to speak) Miami Oolitic Limestone. Miami Oolitic limestone being more porous and rather dissolvable can retain rainwater in its solution holes and this can create a freshwater lens between the two rock layers.This is so very important as it provides year round freshwater access to unique species that are found nowhere else in the Florida Keys such as Caribbean Slash Pine, Key Deer, Key Bunny and a small variety of other unique, endemic plants and animals.  It has many native hardwood trees, as well as the pines for which it is named.  Blue Hole, a former limestone quarry, is quite pretty and contains at least one fairly large alligator.  Like most of the keys, there are no sand beaches here.  A bridge connects the northeast side of the island to No Name Key, a sparsely-populated island with hiking trails.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown Davenport on the Mississippi River  With a population of 101,363 (2012 estimate) Davenport is the largest city in the Quad Cities and the third largest city in Iowa.  It was founded in 1836 by Antoine LeClaire and was named for George Davenport, a colonel during the Black Hawk War stationed at nearby Fort Armstrong and a local merchant. The treaty that ended the Black Hawk War was signed in 1832 by Chief Keokuk, representing the Sauk and Mesquaki tribes and United States Army General Winfield Scott, at what is now Fifth and Farnum Streets. LeClaire, who was fluent in English, French, Spanish and a dozen Native American dialects, served as the interpreter.  This treaty opened large tracts of land in Eastern Iowa to American expansion.  Previously, the Quad Cities was the sight of two of the western most battles of the War of 1812.  Major Zachary Taylor, future US President, commanded American troops in a couple of skirmishes against the Sauk tribe.  One of them was at what is now know as Credit Island on the Mississippi River in the west end.  The city also served as Iowas military headquarters during the American Civil War as the telegraph wires at the time did not continue any further west.  A marker was placed in Lindsey Park along East River Drive to mark the location of Camp McClellan, the largest of five army camps that were located in the city.  The same sight was also the location where members of the Dakota tribe were interred for four years following the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota.  Davenport is known for a couple of "firsts" in history.  The first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River was built between Arsenal Island and Davenport in 1856.  The first chiropractic adjustment was performed by Daniel David Palmer in a building downtown in 1895.  Two years later he established the first school of chiropractic in the city.</field>

		<field name="content">Culver City was founded in 1913 by Harry Culver, a brilliant real estate developer from Nebraska who sold tract homes to "immigrants" from the Midwest. For a monthly mortgage payment, the homes included furniture, dishes, a record player, and sometimes even a Model T. In the 1920s, silent film comedy producer Hal Roach and Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) built studios. By the 1930s, Culver City boasted three major film studios, including MGM, and was  publicized as the "Heart of Screenland." During the 1930s through the 1940s Culver City was home to half of Americas motion picture production.  Hundreds of movies have been produced on the lots of Culver Citys studios, including the Tarzan series and the original King Kong. The yellow brick road from The Wizard of Oz is still inside the lot on Stage 27 of Sony Studios. More recent films include Grease, Raging Bull, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, City Slickers, Wag the Dog and Contact. Television shows made on Culver City sets include Lassie, I Love Lucy, Batman, The Andy Griffith Show and Jeopardy!. Wheel of fortune is spinning there too.  Outside of the studios, Culver City is mostly comprised of middle-class homes that were originally built to house studio workers, with street names reflecting this heritage, such as (Mary) Pickford and (Douglas) Fairbanks.  The downtown area has been undergoing a rejuvenation since the late 1990s with new restaurants, art galleries, theaters and shops that attract a large number of visitors from the local area.</field>

		<field name="content">Utah public lands map   Dixie refers to the low-lying area in the southwest corner of the state. It contains the city of  St. George , and the climate is more closely-related to the southwestern deserts than it is to the rest of the state, with low annual precipitation, hot, dry summers, and mild winters with infrequent snowfall. Early settlers were able to grow cotton in the area, hence the name Dixie (a name for the cotton belt of the southern U.S.).  The Wasatch Range is the heavily-populated region of basins and valleys located between the Wasatch Mountains on the east and on the west by the Great Salt Lake (to the north) and the Oquirrh Mountains (to the south). 3/4 of Utahs population lies in this portion of the state, which stretches from Brigham City in the north to Santaquin in the south.  Ogden ,  Salt Lake City ,  Sandy ,  Orem , and  Provo  are located on the Wasatch Range.  The benches are former shorelines of the ancient Lake Bonneville on the higher slopes along the Wasatch Range. Residential development on the Wasatch Range typically extends high onto the slopes of the Wasatch Mountains in some areas. Homes here are generally more affluent, as they provide spectacular views of the surrounding areas, and the benches receive more precipitation and much more snow than the valley floors.  Mormons or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints make up a majority of Utahs population, and their beliefs and practices are one of the strongest influences for public policy in the state, particularly when it comes to drinking, smoking, and homosexuality. Mormons are generally tolerant and friendly towards non-Mormons, but may be taken aback by cussing, smoking, or drinking in their presence, particularly in the more rural cities and towns. Sunday is considered a day of rest, and so some stores will be closed on Sunday. These stereotypes hold more weight in smaller cities and towns, and in some areas (especially Park City and Salt Lake City) the number of non-Mormons do outnumber members of the LDS faith.</field>

The Lakeside Association maintains municipal and community services, such as the roadways, pier, auditorium, parks, etc.  Private homeowners own individual houses in Lakeside and most of the businesses in the downtown are privately run.     While the Lakeside community and activities are open to all, visitors are expected to adhere to a code of conduct.  Lakeside is a dry community; no alcohol is served in any Lakeside restaurants nor allowed to be consumed anywhere on Association property.  Smoking is likewise prohibited.  Lakeside events and classes are scheduled week by week.  Sign up for many art activities is on Sunday afternoon.</field>

The city is built on centuries of history, boasting strong connections to Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and other early American patriots. Because of the citys use by the Confederacy as a supply and hospital center, it served as a battlefield in the American Civil War. Lynchburg has been designated a portion of Virginias Rail Heritage Region. Lynchburgs historic districts contain many beautiful homes from the 19th century.  Lynchburgs name is derived from its founder, John Lynch, who, at the age of 17, began a ferry service across the James River to facilitate travel to and from New London. He would later be responsible for the bridge which would make his ferry service obsolete. Despite common misconceptions, neither John Lynch nor Lynchburg is associated with the origination of term, "lynching," though it may have originated with Johns brother, Charles.</field>

As such it has more of a blue-collar feel to it than the other major Idaho cities. At one time the city boasted the largest rail yard west of the Mississippi River. The city has a reputation for being a (slightly) more progressive enclave in otherwise conservative, Mormon-dominated Eastern Idaho.  Although the presence of Idaho State University in Pocatello unquestionably makes it a college town as well, student life is somewhat more sedate than in other college towns in the region such as  Moscow , Idaho, or  Missoula ,  Montana . The bar scene can be lively on the weekends, but dont expect to find too many raging frat house keggers here.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert? The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture. The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century. The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day. White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century. The citys name reflects its history as a city "reborn from the ashes" of the previous settlement.  European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture. Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy.  Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again.  Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix. High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive.  As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2006 estimate of 1,512,986 (with the metro area estimated at 4,039,182)  .</field>

		<field name="content">In Mount Dora’s early history, citrus was its major industry and even though you can still get a glorious whiff of the fragrant white blossom of the orange tree in springtime, it has become more of a tourist destination wherein people from all over the world come for its ambiance.    Nicknamed many times over, Mount Dora is often referred to as “The New England of the South”, “The City of Parks”, “Antique City”, and “The Festival City”.  Even Money Magazine seemed enthused, naming Mount Dora in their "Top Places to Live Today". With a population of around 12,000 it still holds a small town appeal but provides many options in shopping, restaurants, and things to do and see.</field>

The area has rolling hills, mountains that have eroded over time along with many man-made lakes.  All of this makes the area attractive for outdoor activities including fishing, hunting and hiking.   The area became a popular tourist attraction overnight with Harold Bell Wrights 1907 novel, "The Shepherd of the Hills".

		<field name="content">Gary is both famous and infamous. Its the "just one place that can light my face" and "home sweet home" effusively described in the song of the same name from the 1957 musical The Music Man.  Its the childhood home of Michael, Tito, Jermaine, and the rest of the Jackson family. Its also home to an unattractive and often industrial-smelling stretch of highway east of  Chicago , and has repeatedly ranked first in the nation among large cities for homicides per capita.  When designing the city, the U.S. Steel Corporation bragged that its engineers "took for their guidance the motto that hangs in the office of the big companys chief executive, "It can be done," and made Gary at least an attractive, if not a beautiful, residential town," and posited Gary as evidence that "management has always shown its realization of the fact that "not by bread alone does man live"; that the mere paying of employees a living wage is not sufficient, and that even the least educated worker has an aesthetic sense, even though often uncultivated, that should be developed and pandered to within reasonable limits if the best good of the worker and the employer is to be achieved." As U.S. Steel began to struggle in the late 1960s, the citys economy followed, and it has yet to recover.  Two casinos, legalized in Gary out of sheer desperation, make it a destination for gamblers on short trips and locals on pay-day. Its crumbling architectural heritage also makes it a favorite mdash; and dangerous mdash; destination for  urban exploration .</field>

		<field name="content">Nauvoo is most famous for having been founded in 1840 by Joseph Smith, Jr., as one of the first centers of The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints, following their exodus from  Missouri  in the wake of the Mormon War. In 1844, owing to hostility between the Mormons and their neighbors, as well as worries over a perceived theocracy in Nauvoo, the Illinois Legislature stripped the town of its legal status, leaving Nauvoo as a large (~12,000 residents) unincorporated community de facto ruled by the LDS Church. By 1846 hostilities (including vigilante violence and the assassination of Joseph Smith, Jr.) had grown severe enough that Brigham Young (accepted by most of Smiths followers as his successor) and his supporters left in what is known as the Mormon Exodus, along the Mormon Trail.  The temple, which was the second the Mormons built after the original (which in turn was destroyed in the Mormon War) in Missouri, was burnt down by arsonists shortly following the Mormon Exodus. But in 1999 the temple was built and completed in 2002. The exterior is a faithful reconstruction, but the interior (which is off-limits to non-Mormons) follows the architectural plan of a modern LDS temple  .</field>

Clinton is equidistant from New York and Boston, making it a comfortable commuting distance of the metropolitan industrial centers of New Haven, Middletown and New London. Clinton is contained within 17.2 square miles with an estimated population of 13,500 and an estimated the population growth to 20,000 during the summer months.  Three (3) rivers flow through Clinton into the Clinton Harbor and the Long Island Sound; the Hammonasset, Indian and Hammock Rivers.  Clinton is located between the towns of Madison and Westbrook, Connecticut.  Clinton Harbor is naturally protected to the Long Island Sound and is situated 22 miles east of New Haven and 37 miles northwest of Point Montauk (Long Island).  The easy-to-enter harbor is very popular with cruising boaters and contains many marinas, our Town Beach, Cedar Island and borders Hammonasset State Park.  The town center contains two historic districts, the Clinton Village Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Liberty Green Historic District (LGHD), which is a local historic district contained within the Clinton Village Historic District.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Idahos nickname is "The Gem State," although the motto on the states license plates reads "Famous Potatoes." This often has the unfortunate result that anyone who has heard of Idaho imagines the state as a vast expanse of potato farms, with grizzled inhabitants living in cabins with no running water.In reality,Idaho is increasingly becoming a mix of both city and rural life. Some Idahoans do live in cabins in the middle of nowhere, but others live in urbane condominiums in downtown Boise. Indeed, Boise is now the largest metropolitan area in the  Rocky Mountains  region of the US outside of  Colorado . Most of the other major cities in Idaho have also experienced significant growth over the past 20 years.  Idaho is typical of several other western states, e.g., Oregon, Washington, and California, in that there are really two states in one. The northern part of Idaho is characterized by mountains, lakes, forests and rivers.  While the southern half has some spectacular mountains (the Owyhees and parts of the Tetons), it is mostly high-plains desert similar to the Inland Empire of southern California.    Most of the world-famous Idaho potatoes are grown in Eastern Idaho. Onions are an important cash crop in southwestern Idaho near the Oregon border, while sugar beets are prevalent in the Twin Falls area. As many crops are irrigated in the otherwise arid Snake River Plain, water is an extremely important and potentially explosive political issue in Idaho.  Northern Idaho farming is characterized by dry land wheat, barley, and legume crops. Logging is also a big part of the northern Idaho economy, although not as much as in the past. A favorite bumper sticker in north Idaho is "If You Dont Like Logging, Try Using Plastic Bags For Toilet Paper."  Similar to Washington and Oregon, there is a great disparity in the population of each half of the state.  North Idaho is significantly less populated than the southern half.  Idaho is second only to Utah in the number of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, or Mormons, as a percentage of the population. Mormon religion and culture are particularly prevalent in Eastern Idaho, where the faith is at least as strong as anywhere in Utah. However, the LDS Churchs influence diminishes considerably as one travels north of Boise towards the panhandle.  Southern Idaho is home to one of the largest populations of Basque people in the world outside the  Basque Country  itself. Public displays of Ikurriña flags and car stickers are somewhat common, even in rural areas. The state even issues a Basque specialty automobile license plate. Next scheduled for 2015, a major Basque festival known as Jaialdi is celebrated in Boise every five years.  A common misconception is that Idaho is somehow a racist or Neo-Nazi state. Around 1980, a Neo-Nazi and white separatist brought a band of followers to Hayden Lake near Coeur dAlene and began regularly making the local and national news with his racist provocations. Although the local residents vigorously disapproved and regularly held much bigger counter-demonstrations, the Neo-Nazi image has stuck. Idahoans breathed a collective sigh of relief in 2001 when the 20 acre compound owned by the "church" was handed over to a woman who had filed a lawsuit against them after being assaulted by their guards, and many of the racists left the state.  Southeastern Idaho, with its sparse topsoil, was greatly affected by the rising water level of prehistoric Lake Bonneville to the south, a lake which covered most of what is now the states of Utah and Nevada.  At Red Rock Pass south of Pocatello, the rising waters broke through into the region in an ancient, massive flood, channeling the floodwater westward for what is estimated to have lasted for approximately seven weeks, almost completely draining the ancient lake and creating the massive, lengthy, and spectacular Snake River Canyon that we know today.  The massive flood stripped the regions topsoil down to bedrock, tumbling huge, multi-story high boulders downstream, where eventually the boulders and other heavier materials dropped out and were deposited in and along the Snake River streambed. The stripped topsoil, a much lighter material, eventually was deposited well to the west, creating  fertile farming regions well adapted to growing potatoes. Because of the great flood and the stripping of the regions topsoil, much of the agriculture in southeastern Idahos thin layer of topsoil must be supported by fertilization as well as irrigation.</field>

The reservoir contains 207,363 acres (839 square kilometers) of both land and water, which is divided almost evenly among  Utah  and  Wyoming .  The canyon was named by explorer John Wesley, who upon first looking at the red gorge believed that it was on fire.   In 1958 the Flaming Gorge Dam was created, which today is what keeps the water contained in the reservoir.  The Flaming Gorge reservoir is extremely popular for boaters for it contains 5 full-service marinas, which offer launching, storage, and maintenance facilities.  Because the water in the reservoir always remains cool, even in the extreme heat, it is an avid spot for water sport enthusiasts.  The reservoir is also known for attracting a large number of trout, which makes it a keen area for fishermen.  The Green River, which is part of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area is also very popular for fishing.  The river is additionally well-liked for  rafting .  The Flaming Gorge National Recreational Area in addition contains many campground and hiking trails found along the 360 miles of shoreline, including some secluded grounds only accessible by boat.</field>

		<field name="content">Charles H. "Dad" Worland in 1900 dug his underground stage stop here on the old Bridger Trail. From Dad’s dugout grew the City of Worland drawing pioneer men and women possessing an indomitable spiritual force dreaming that the Big Horn River water would create a new way of life here in the desert. In 1903, a party of surveyors made their way into the Big Horn Basin area to determine the feasibility of a large irrigation project. At that time, the current site of Worland had a population of less than 100 people. However, the area held promise and plans were started. With muscles and guts, horses and hand tools, they dug miles of irrigation canals. With the precious water, the parched land became an oasis. By 1904, the project was in full swing and Camp Worland prospered into a community with a school, church, post office and general store. In 1906, with the coming of the railroad, Camp Worland faced a dilemma. Railroad tracks were laid on the east side of the Big Horn River and the encampment was located on the west side. Forced to make a decision about the future of Camp Worland, townspeople decided to move their community across the frozen Big Horn River by sliding the buildings on skids. Incorporated in 1906 as the town of Worland, the friendly community continues to prosper and grow. Sheltered by formidable mountains the Big Horn Basin for ten thousand Great Suns, nurturing hunting tribes of Crow, Sioux, Arapahoe, and Shoshone who followed Pte Tanka, the Buffalo, and their livelihood. Trappers and gold seekers ripped and ran. Bluecoats came and went. Ranchers and farmers brought courageous wives to put down roots and to weave a new civilization here in the wilderness. They built sand, sage, and water into Worland and Washakie County. The Jewel of the Big Horn Basin. The proud tradition of Worland is evidenced throughout the town today. Heritage and determination continue to drive this friendly, warm and western town into the future.</field>

During the Industrial Revolution it became home to one of the largest steel companies in the world, Bethlehem Steel, and its main manufacturing plant. Alas, the company folded in the 2001, closing the steel plant and setting off a temporary local downturn. Today, the city has a population of about 73,000, and is a thriving with a beautiful historic district, many cultural events, two colleges within center city, and a large casino/entertainment complex.

East New York like many Brooklyn neighborhoods is rich in its own history with homes where farms once stood and its many parks like Highland Park where children can roam free to play. The Gateway Mall is one of the few suburban-like malls in the city and the City Line subsection or Liberty Avenue is where residents can come and do there shopping for food and clothing. Alongside the projects, parks and new homes are popping up everywhere. Like  Brownsville , East New York is one of most dangerous communities in New York City, though the crime rate has dropped quite a lot since the bad old days a few decades ago. Most visitors to New York City only pass through on their way to or from John F. Kennedy Airport on the A and J trains or the B15 bus. Canarsie is a West Indian neighborhood with somewhat of a "small-town" feel, largely composed of 1- and 2-family houses. The major commercial streets are Rockaway Parkway and parts of Seaview Avenue. Mill Basin and Bergen Beach are largely residential areas, predominantly occupied by Italian, Jewish, and Russian inhabitants.</field>

Cornell was founded in 1853 as the Iowa Conference Seminary but, in 1857, it would be renamed after iron tycoon William Welsey Cornell, a distant cousin of Ezra Cornell (founded of Cornell University).  As the college expanded, the town invariably also enjoyed the benefit.  Today, many members of the faculty and staff at Cornell are also long-time residents and participants in the community, which gives the town a strong college feel.  The entire Cornell campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

		<field name="content">San Leandro (known locally as SL) is in  Alameda County  in the  East Bay  portion of  Californias   Bay Area . Historically a town with dozens of huge cherry farms and a Spanish missionary ranch, San Leandro today is a rapidly growing city home to prominent business firms and is a suburb of  Oakland . Founded in 1872, it is one of the oldest cities in California. San Leandro does not have as much to offer as its neighbors, however its central location may make it a very economical home base for tourists and commuters, and its panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay and its hills are worth a trip for visitors.  San Leandro has a diverse population, with Asians forming a plurality at roughly 30% of the population, Whites and Hispanics each at around 27%, African-Americans at 12%, and one of the lower 48 States larger Pacific Islander populations forming about 1% of the citys population.   Weather in San Leandro is very comfortable throughout most of the year, ranging from the mid 50s to upper 70s. However, early morning weather in the winter (5AM-7AM) can reach as low as the mid 20s with frost, and in high pressure systems in the summer can cause temperatures to reach as high as the mid to upper 90s.  Population: 84,950 (2010 United States Census) Elevation: 56 feet</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Long Island City encompasses a very large and increasingly diverse section of Queens that stretches along the East River from the Queensboro Bridge north.   The southern half of the neighborhood, informally known as Long Island City to locals, was traditionally an industrial area and often still feels like Manhattans unkempt broom closet, with its train depots, factory buildings, school bus parking lots and the like. But since the early 2000s a burgeoning art community has grown like a weed through the cracks in a sidewalk and is now quite strong, with multiple art galleries, performance spaces, a formal museum that acts as a branch of MoMA. This in turn has attracted a stretch of quality restaurants and bars along Vernon Boulevard north of the bridge, which has in turn brought new housing development and a growing community of young families along the river.   The northern half of LIC is more popularly known as Astoria, after fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who acted as front-man investor for development of a village here in the early nineteenth century. In the 1910s Astoria became home to the first American silent film studios -- a heritage celebrated at the Museum of the Moving Image -- but today the neighborhood is more locally famous for the large Greek community that began its migration here in the 1960s and have bestowed it with an embarrassment of excellent Greek food in its tavernas and ethnic grocers. Astorias plethora of reasonably priced rental housing has today attracted a new migration of young artists and hipsters, and there is also an increase in migration of people from across the world here. Most notable in that respect is the large Middle Eastern community that centers itself around Steinway Boulevard south of the Triboro Bridge.</field>

Hopkins is a dynamic community of over 17,000 residents located just 13 minutes west of  Minneapolis . Founded rich in tradition and growth, Hopkins offers the advantages and conveniences of a large city but yet the security of a small town.</field>

A mostly upper-class destination for adults, the town itself is small - you can walk across it in five minutes - but filled with art galleries, cafes, restaurants and inns. Every evening, visitors gather on the pristine beach to watch colorful sunsets.  Temperatures in September are perfect: 70-80°F (21-27°C) during the day and 50-60°F (10-16°C) at night. Bring sweaters and dress in layers for all-day activities.  Ocean Avenue is downtowns main street, sloping from the highway down to the beach, with many shops, coffee houses, and galleries.  Scenic Drive meanders along the curve of the beach. A packed dirt path along the roadside is a favorite with local joggers and dog-walkers. The town is especially dog-friendly with many lodging and dining accommodations welcoming the canine guests.    Carmel Valley  is formed by the Carmel River, flowing some 20 miles from the Santa Lucia mountains to the Pacific Ocean. The town of Carmel Valley is located 12 miles inland from Highway 1, on Carmel Valley Road. Quite often when Carmel-by-the-Sea is fogged in, Carmel Valley is sunny and warm.</field>

Allentowns main drag, Allen Street, is lined with a wide range of restaurants, bars, and shops catering to the artists, bohemians, upwardly-mobile twentysomethings, punk rockers, and other "alternative" types that have taken up residence here over the past decades. Off Allen Street are found a profusion of charming Victorian residences, largely two-story brick cottages in 19th-century styles such as the Italianate, Gothic Revival, and French Second Empire; it was Allentowns cornucopia of lovely residences that was responsible for the neighborhoods inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  The Delaware District follows Delaware Avenue and its adjacent streets from the northern border of Allentown to Delaware Park. Though there is little here in the way of entertainment, especially compared to Allentown, the area is of interest to visitors due to the lavish mansions that line its main thoroughfare. Once one of the most prestigious addresses in America, the breathtaking residences along Delaware Avenue are an architecture lovers dream come true: elegant palaces from the Gilded Age that were once home to aristocratic Buffalo families like the Curtisses, the Rumseys, and the Knoxes. The portion of Delaware Avenue between North and Bryant Streets, where the densest concentration of original mansions can be found, is known as Millionaires Row and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places; however, huge mansions of this type can periodically be found as far north as Gates Circle.  The Delaware District, such as it is defined in this article, includes a number of peripheral areas that purists might argue to be separate neighborhoods. These include Linwood Avenue, a Local Historic District located a block east of Delaware Avenue that is densely lined with ample wood-frame houses only slightly newer and less luxurious than those on Delaware Avenue, Oxford, a more middle-class, mixed-race neighborhood situated southwest of the corner of Main Street and West Delavan Avenue, adjacent to Canisius College, and Midtown, a term developers have begun to use to describe the newly emerging business district along Main Street between approximately Summer and West Ferry Streets, straddling the Delaware District and the  East Side .</field>

The resort is for both local skiers and avid outsiders wanting to enjoy the mountain.  While Alta exists only as a ski resort today, the town has an interesting history. It was a mining town in the 1800s to 1900s. The first verified silver claim in Alta was staked in 1865. In 1937, the mayor of Alta gave acres of surface rights to the U.S. Forest Service for development of a ski area.  Norwegian skiing legend Alf Engen was hired to help develop the area, and Alta opened its first ski lift in 1938. The first Collins lift was constructed in 1938 out of pieces of old aerial mining tram.  As home to the second chairlift in US history, Alta played a major role in the creation of the modern day ski resort model. Skiing remains the main industry in the town.  In addition, Alta keeps up with the modern times, and is going green. The Alta Environmental Center states its primary goal is to strive for sustainability and to continuously investigate viable ways to decrease Alta Ski Areas carbon while maintaining a healthy business.</field>

The tri-state area shares a very similar range in temperature and they take pleasure in all four seasons.  The town is known for its major institutions like Holy Name Medical Hospital and the Metropolitan Campus of Farleigh Dickinson University, the largest private university in the state of New Jersey. The Teaneck Armory is home to the New Jersey National Guard’s 50th Main Support Battalion and they host many events  for the community, mainly in the summer months.

		<field name="content">Quanah was named after Quanah Parker, known as the last chief of the Comanches. His mother, Cynthia Ann Parker, was captured in 1820 by the Comanches. She became assimilated into the group, marrying a Comanche and having children, of whom Quanah was the first. She was later "rescued" by the white settlers in a location near  Copper Breaks  south of town, and never allowed contact with her husband or children again, starving herself to death two years later. Quanah went on to lead a large band of Comanches in attacks against hunters and the US Army in an effort to retain tribal lands and save the great buffalo herds, which the whites were mercilessly and wastefully killing off at an alarming rate. He participated in many famous battles throughout the  Panhandle , including the Second Battle of Adobe Walls, near modern-day  Borger . When finally cornered at  Palo Duro Canyon  in 1875, Quanahs band was the last group of free Plains Indians to be forced onto a reservation, bringing an end to the Red River War. Quanah subsequently became something of an advocate for westernization, quickly learning English and Spanish and converting to a form of Christianity. He was eventually named chief of all the Comanche people. By 1905 he was parading with Geronimo in the inaugural parade for Theodore Roosevelt, with whom he went on occasional hunting trips. Quanah Parker is now buried at Fort Sills in  Oklahoma .</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Although the exact origin is disputed, the name "Boise" is thought to be derived from the French "les bois," or "the trees." The name is a reference to the tree-lined Boise River, which passes through the heart of the city. To this day the city takes its "City of Trees" moniker very seriously, although before settlement there were actually very few trees here.  Boise started its life as Fort Boise, a U.S. Army installation located at a strategic junction on the Oregon Trail between what were then the major settlements in southern Idaho Territory, the mining camps of Silver City to the south and Idaho City to the northeast. A city grew quickly around the fort, and by 1865 was the new capital of Idaho Territory (much to the chagrin of northern Idahoans, namely residents of Lewiston). By the dawn of the 20th Century, Boise was far and away the dominant city in the region, having long eclipsed the likes of Silver City and Idaho City.  Today Boise is sometimes seen as the eastern enclave of the Pacific Northwest, or the western enclave of the Rocky Mountains, or both, depending on who you ask. Downtown Boise and the North End neighborhood offer a PNW feel every bit as strong as anything in Portland or Seattle, while suburbs such as Meridian and Nampa steadfastly cling to the decidedly self-reliant ethos of the Intermountain West.  Boise is a sports town strongly supporting its local teams, including the NBA D-League Idaho Stampede, the ECHL Idaho Steelheads, and of course its emerging college football powerhouse at Boise State University - all with recent league and conference championships. Slowly but surely, Boise is beginning to accept its role as a major metropolitan area in the western United States, while at the same time embracing its small town past.  Regions of the city are best distinguished by the age of the construction (pre 1950s, 1950s-1980s suburbs, and post 1990 suburbs) and the affluence of their inhabitants, with the premier exception being Downtown, which is non-residental construction and nightlife.  The North End refers to a distinct neighborhood due to the grid style of street construction, smaller pre-1940s suburban houses, relatively dense vegetation, and numerous amenities within walking distance of most residents.  Boise has no culturally discernible neighborhoods, although a few ethnic restaurants and food stores exist.</field>

		<field name="content">This village was named after Abram Maybee, who built a grist-mill and a saw-mill there in the early 1870s. The reason for its large growth was the large amount of timber in the area, seen by developers as a potential for making charcoal, and several kilns. After that development, immigrants from the Palatinate states of Germany settled there to till the land for better drainage. One can see many of the immigrants sturdy brick homes, built between 1870 and 1900, along Maybees farm roads. The Canadian Southern Railroad came through Maybee to build a station, stabilizing the surrounding economy. It was eventually incorporated in 1899.</field>

		<field name="content">The Shenandoah Valley is formed by two mountain ranges, the Blue Ridge on the east and the Appalachian on the west. Another mountain ridge, the Massanutten, runs down the middle, as does the Shenandoah River. The Shenandoah Valley is believed to have been named by a lost Native American tribe. The meaning of the name is disputed, but the most popular interpretation is “daughter of the stars”.   Intrepid Englishmen began to explore and settle the valley in the early 18th century. Germans and Scots-Irish first entered the valley from the north in the 1730s. A young George Washington worked in the area as a surveyor for Lord Fairfax. Locals such as Daniel Morgan, Peter Muhlenberg, and George Rogers Clark distinguished themselves during the war of Independence.   During the Civil War, the Shenandoah Valley was the site of many battles, primarily because the region’s moniker, “the breadbasket of the Confederacy”. If Union troops could control the valley, they would cut off a large portion of the Confederate troops’ rations. The city of Winchester, at the northern end of the valley, traded hands over eighty times during the war. The most important battle fought in the region was the Battle of New Market.</field>

The development of new roads including Highway 22 and Highway 31 have helped tremendously in the way of congestion.

The state features wide open spaces, lonesome highways and dramatic scenery, both to the east and west of the continental divide.   Residents of Montana often classify themselves as either easterners or westerners, depending upon their geographic home. The west is often considered more picturesque, but is also more populated and heavily touristed. The eastern half of the state is more sparsely populated, with low lying plains, bluffs and cliffs. Attitude-wise, the west is generally considered more liberal, while the east, with its large ranching and agricultural operations, is considered more conservative.  The state economy is primarily based on agriculture, ranching, logging and mining as well as tourism.</field>

		<field name="content">New Bedford is a city of around 100,000 people, many of Portuguese (particularly Madeira) or Cape Verdean ancestry, still with a great many off the boat immigrants from both.  The city has gone through strongly contrasting cycles of poverty and wealth, from its relatively late (by Southeast Massachusetts standards) settlement and foundation, to the peaque of the whaling industry, its growth as a textile city in the 20th Century, and the subsequent crash brought on by rapid mill closure in the latter 20th Century.  Its been known as one of the rougher, seedier locales of New England for a number of decades now, but its strongly on the upswing since the historic center was declared a federally protected historic site in 1996.  While youll still find plenty of slums, projects, and tenements throughout the city, youll also find the waterfront full of narrow cobblestone streets and alleyways, historic 18th and 19th Century buildings, and upscale restaurants and museums.  Its also one of the only fortified cities in the US, featuring an impressive (and walkable) gated harbor wall that runs from the South End cove across the mouth of the Acushnet river to neighboring Fairhaven.  Additionally, there are pockets of grandeur in most parts of the city, with a long stretch of Victorian mansions on County Street that features some truly jaw-dropping architecture, akin to Newports humbler dwellings.  Though the downtown is perfectly safe at night these days, many neighborhoods are still dangerous and walking through them is not advised.</field>

Civic growth is not greatly helped by the climate.  T-shirts available at the airport have this motto: "Why not Minot? Freezins the reason!"

Although Brooklyn is very diverse, what makes Brooklyn so different from the other boroughs are its distinct cultural neighborhoods. Manhattan is frequently referred to as "the city" by residents of the other boroughs mdash; for example, in the phrase "Im going to the city." Many Brooklynites have a great deal of pride in their borough, and most New Yorkers consider Brooklynites to have an identity distinct from that of other New Yorkers. In any case, remember while speaking to Brooklynites that referring to Manhattan as "the city" is acceptable but calling Manhattan "New York City" is not. Be careful not to confuse Brooklyn and the  Bronx  - they are very different parts of New York City.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Tega Cay is on the east side of Lake Wylie just fifteen miles south of Charlotte and Charlottes Douglas International Airport.   In 1970 Charlie Erwin, a developer from Charlotte, purchased this 1600 acre "beautiful peninsula" and called it by its Tahitian name - Tega Cay.  The South Seas theme was carried out in street names such as Molokai, Pago Pago and Kailua, and in the architecture.  The city has sixteen miles of shoreline, a rugged topography and is densely wooded with pines and hardwoods. During the 1970s, the developers financial difficulties led ultimately to bankruptcy.  The Property Owners Association elected to establish a political subdivision.  The City of Tega Cay was incorporated in 1982, on the fourth of July, with much fanfare.  Each fourth of July the City celebrates its birthday with ceremonies, parades, fireworks, games, and the cutting of the ceremonial birthday cake with a military saber.  At the ceremonies, a new star is added to the City flag that was especially designed for the first celebration.  The number of stars indicates the age of the City. The City has a Mayor-Council form of government.  The Mayor and Council persons are elected to serve four year staggered terms with elections held every two years.  The Mayor is the Chief Administrative officer who oversees the daily operation of City government. The Fire Department and Rescue Squad members are all volunteers.  Both receive financial support from the City.  There are no schools in the City; the students attend Fort Mill Township schools, which are noted for their excellence.  All utilities are underground and privately owned including water, sewer, power, telephone, and TV cables. Tega Cay offers golfers the only 27-hole public golf course in the South Charlotte area.  Each nine is different.  The Grande View, just one year old, is getting rave reviews for its mountain-like changes of elevation and spectacular views.  The Cove requires an accurate iron game especially on the par three 6th hole that crosses a cove of Lake Wylie.  Refurbishing all the greens of the Carolina Pines began this summer The City has two waterfront parks, two lighted ball fields and several small interior parks.  In 1997 the City constructed a 1 1/2 mile long paved pedestrian pathway adjacent to Tega Cay Drive.  A new YMCA Wellness Center, located just outside the City, opened in August 1999.  It has state of the art equipment and a trained staff of professionals.</field>

		<field name="content">Locals are not impressed by Prada or Kate Spade bags.  That’s not to say they’re judging, and most of them can hang with the high-falutin’ style, but it is just not necessary for a walk down Main Street or a drive on the  Blue Ridge Parkway .  To assimilate yourself, be approachable and friendly – sit down next to the man at the bar with calloused hands.  He probably knows the best place to go and walk your dog.  Speak to the woman in line in front of you at the grocery store; she might know the best place in town to get a chocolate-infused filet mignon.   With a population that jumps from 1,500 year-round to 8,000 in the summertime, people are used to making new friends.  The beauty of Blowing Rock is the dichotomy between the elegant and the down-home.  The affluent traveler may find pleasure in the abundance of fine dining and shopping the area has to offer, but walk just fifteen steps and they’ll find the opposite end of the spectrum – quintessential, good, honest, down home, small town charm.  They can find it everywhere - from the wait staff and diners at the fifteen table “everything” restaurant on Main Street, to the hikers en route the trail to Little Lost Cove.  If you’re looking for a seedy underbelly, you’re going to have to look pretty hard. Downtown Blowing Rock is about as “Norman Rockwell quaint” as it gets.  Children are free to roam in a safe and clean park, while their mothers can shop for antiques and designer clothes, and their fathers can sneak off to Kilwin’s Ice Cream Parlor for a free sample of fudge. A military band plays after the downtown Fourth of July parade every year.  Winterfest in January brings ice-carvers and dog-sledders.  Mitford Days in September celebrates Blowing Rock’s inspiration for Jan Karon’s book series.  Year-round, a bubble machine from the Martin House pours soapy goodness into the air, surrounding you as you stroll.  Knight’s on Main has fried oysters every Friday (just try and fight the locals for a table).  Canyons Restaurant even heats their building with recycled fryer oil, for crying out loud!  This is clean livin’.</field>

It is the unofficial capital of the southernmost region of Texas, commonly referred to as the Rio Grande Valley, and acts as the social, financial, entertainment and shopping hub for the region which boasts 1.3 million residents. McAllens vitality drives the citys tourism, business, education, shopping, and health advances, often placing it ahead of Texas and the nation.  McAllen is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, and is rated as one of the best U.S. places to do business and one of the top 8 safest U.S. cities.    The city has grown rapidly over the past century.  In 1910 the population was about 150.  The city now has a population exceeding 130,000, but serves the 4 million people within a 60-mile radius.   Over 85% of the citys population is Hispanic or Latino; almost everyone in bilingual to some degree.    McAllen is the most popular U.S. shopping destination for Mexican residents. The city hosts millions of Mexican shoppers per year, and therefore accommodates a much larger number of retail stores and restaurants than other cities of its size.  Many of the Mexican tourists and shoppers in the area come from  Monterrey , a highly technologically advanced city and the third most populous in Mexico, with a population of about 4 million. A brief glance at a mall parking lot, however, will reveal shoppers from almost all 32 states of Mexico.   McAllen is renowned for its warm winter weather and low cost of living.  In the winter months, large numbers of retirees live in the McAllen area. Affectionately called Winter Texans, they come predominantly from the midwestern United States and Canada and stay in RV parks, apartments, second homes and extended-stay hotels. Winter is "season" for McAllern, and the time with most of the social activities, many planned especially for Winter Texans.  McAllen is also the hub of the Rio Grande Valley for birding. 2.3 million birders visit the McAllen region every year. There are literally dozens of birding spots in the McAllen area, including the World Birding Centers, a complex of 9 sites dedicated to wildlife watching. 528 bird species and over 300 butterfly species have been recorded in the area, making it the most productive birding location in North America. Go to www.visitmcallen.com and www.southtexasnature.com for more information.  The first real development in the area that would later become McAllen occurred in the 1850s.  That development was led by John McAllen.  In 1904, he established a town site then known as West McAllen.  In 1907, a separate group of developers established a town known as East McAllen.  Eventually, the two towns merged and the City of McAllen was incorporated in 1911.    McAllen is surrounded by several medium size towns and cities.  These cities are so interconnected that they sometimes appear to be one larger city.  For census purposes the federal government includes all these areas under the heading McAllen–Edinburg–Mission Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The MSA has been in the top 10 for several positive categories many times--that dynamic growth and change making every visit unique. Always, some new stores open along with new places to eat.</field>

		<field name="content">Kennewick and the greater Tri-Cities region draws a great deal of their cultural influence from having a past that was heavily enriched by the Cold War. In nearby  Richland , the Hanford Nuclear Site is the home to many historical landmarks, as well as the worlds first full scale nuclear reactor. The atomic bomb that was dropped on  Nagasaki ,  Japan  in 1945 contained Hanford produced plutonium. Today, the nuclear site has changed its mission from plutonium enrichment to environmental clean up and restoration.  In modern times, agriculture has been a major factor in the areas economy. Wheat is the most widely grown crop in the region, as well as fruit such as apples, cherries, and grapes (the region is home to more than 160 wineries). This is due mainly to the high quality of the regions soil and the ease of irrigation made possible by three nearby rivers (Columbia, Snake and Yakima Rivers).  Kennewick is the commercial district for the Tri-Cities region. Residents from central and southeastern Washington state, as well as from northeastern Oregon, visit the city for its shopping resources and entertainment venues. It is also home to several parks, including Columbia Park, which is a 400 acre recreational area with nearly 5 miles of Columbia River shoreline.   The wine industry is prevalent in the Kennewick and Tri-Cities region, with over 160 wineries within an hours drive. Due to the regions climate of long, warm summer days (an average of 300 days of sunshine per year), and crisp cool nights; combined with rich volcanic soils and controlled irrigation, make it a nearly perfect location to grow premium grapes. A wide variety are grown throughout the region including Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Pinot Noir and others.  There has been significant population growth in Kennewick and the greater Tri-Cities region over the last decade as the region also harbors a large technological industry. A major employer of many residents in Kennewick is Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which is one of the U.S. Department of Energys major national laboratories. In the past, Forbes has named Kennewick the 2 area in the country for job growth.  More recently, Kiplinger has rated the Tri-Cities region as one of the top 10 places to live and raise a family. CNN/Money has ranked the Tri-Cities region as one of the top 10 best bets for gains in housing value, due to its relatively stable economic conditions since the early 2000s.</field>

It was named because of the helper cars needed on the railroad to help the trains get up the mountain.  Just to the East of the city you can take a little hike to a few different ghost towns (they were coal mining towns). Spring Canyon Trail follows the abandoned railroad line that served the coal camps of Peerless, Spring Canyon, Standardville, Latuda, Rains and Mutual. The paved trail winds though the canyon past the old town sites where only ghosts remain. Several parking areas and restroom facilities are available along the trail.</field>

		<field name="content">The state capital moved to Vandalia only two years after Illinois became a state. Three separate buildings in Vandalia served as the Capitol: the first burned, the second was torn down, and the third remains as a historic site, maintained both as a part of Illinois history, and more importantly as a part of the life of Abraham Lincoln. In 1839, the legislature moved to  Springfield , leaving the quiet town of Vandalia behind.  Long before the Interstate Highway system, the US federal government began building the National Road in 1811, planned to connect Maryland with Missouri. This was the first federally-funded road in the new country. While funding shortfalls stopped the road in Vandalia in 1839, the National Road served as the gateway to the west for thousands of settlers, bringing them as far as central Illinois. When the "modern" US highway system was developed in 1925, the National Road became a part of US 40.  Today, you may tour the last Vandalia State Capitol, sit in the chamber where Lincoln sat, visit the National Road Interpretive Center, and see Lincoln-era artifacts and antiques at the county museum.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Looking across S. University Street at the outside of the Law Quadrangle  Ann Arbor is centered on the  University of Michigan . The U of M campus intermingles with downtown, and the whole area is walkable, though day buses run between the campuses and the central business district. Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Thomson, Google, and Dominos have a major presence in the area. The University is well known for its medical school complex.   Farther out, the city fades into urban sprawl (a mall and business parks in the south), then countryside dotted with towns, and to the east,  Detroit  suburbs. Bus routes beyond the city limits, except in the direction of  Ypsilanti , are lacking; youll want a car or bike unless you have several hours to spare. On some autumn Saturdays, transport is difficult as 100,000-odd people pour in for university football games.  Ann Arbor, or Tree town, is, as one might expect, full of trees; they line the streets, and in summer from the air, or year-round in Google Earth, all that can be seen is a green swath with a few buildings sticking out. (In the early 20th century, after having leveled the forest that once occupied the area, the city instituted an aggressive tree-planting program thats since borne fruit.)  Like most of Michigan, summers can be hot and humid, with temperatures occasionally hitting 90 degrees, but averaging in the mid 80s. Winters are fairly normal for the lower Great Lakes region, which enjoys 4 seasons. It starts to be chilly in late October and it begins to warm up again in mid-March (but the occasional early April snowfall is not unheard of!). Average winter temperatures are generally in the range of 30°F and in January temps can dip below 20°F, or even lower if its windy.  Summers can get quite hot; in mid-July it can hit high into the 90s with high humidity.   Downtown is a solid block of restaurants and art galleries. The university hosts cultural events, and venues such as the Michigan Theater host first-run independent films and high-profile music groups. Several good independent bookshops are located here, as was the Borders flagship store until its closing in 2011, and the Ann Arbor Art Fair draws over half a million visitors each summer.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Haight Street   The Haight is made up of two neighborhoods: Haight-Fillmore, usually called the Lower Haight, and Haight-Ashbury, also known as the Upper Haight. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large hill and are bisected by Divisadero Street.  The neighborhoods have two separate histories whose cultures and identities merged in the 1960s as poor, young white hippies moved into the Upper Haight and began to make contact with the poor, young black residents of the Lower Haight.  Together, these outcasts forged the counter-culture movement the Haight is most well known for.  Today, the two neighborhoods remain similar, yet distinct.  The Upper Haight is more of a tourist destination, more identified with its hippie roots, and is safer, especially since the 1990s.  The Lower Haight retains more of its black roots. Since the Lower Haight does not have as much tourist traffic, rents are less expensive, and there are more shops featuring young local artists rather than stores catering to hippie-nostalgia foot traffic.   In the 1960s large portions of the predominantly African American Fillmore District were involuntarily relocated to Haight-Ashbury due to the disruptive urban renewal movements of the time. At the same time, middle class whites began moving to the growing suburbs of the Bay Area, causing home values in the area to plunge. The neighborhood, with its then-surplus of affordable Victorian homes, was ripe for housing an influx of African American families as well as Beats attracted by the growing intellectual, anti-establishment community surrounding the local universities, as well as an emerging (pre-Castro District) gay and lesbian community.    With the onset of the Vietnam War, many white middle class college kids derailed by the draft now began to move into the Haight, identifying with the counterculture trends already taking place in the neighborhood and adopting Hippie ideologies and alternative lifestyles. Many thrived while other lives were ruined by destructive drugs such as speed, heroin and cocaine, and some remain committed to the Hippie dream to this day.  While gentrification has turned the Upper Haight into something of a counterculture theme park (although it is also home to many young, homeless drug addicts, though no longer of the peaceful, hippie variety), there are still plenty of eclectic finds to uncover here and one can still can get a sense of the once-bohemian nature of this area.</field>

Fly kites and enjoy free weekend concerts in the summer. While staying hip and vibrant, "the slope" as it is commonly referred to, also enjoys its share of wealth. The quaint, tree-lined streets closer to the park house ornate,  brownstones, townhouses, full service apartment buildings, and even a few full scale urban mansions on the parkside. These residences include the homes of names such as Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and famed actresses Jennifer Connelly, Steve Buscemi and Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Check out 5th Ave for the restaurants and bars. Prospect Heights is just north of Prospect Park. It features the Brooklyn Museum, which is first-rate but often overlooked due to the museums in Manhattan. A block away from the museum is the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The four, 60-foot granite faces of Mount Rushmore National Memorial draw more than three million visitors each year, and thats just for each head!  The first blast on the mountain occurred in 1927. Under the direction of sculptor Gutzon Borglum, 400 workers labored through hot summers and cold winters to create the sculpture, nearly 500 feet up the side of the mountain. More than 90 percent of the mountain was carved using dynamite. The fine details of the faces were achieved with a jackhammer. Operators hung from the top of the mountain in bosun chairs held by steel cables. Despite the dangerous work, during the 14 years of construction, not a single person died. The memorial was officially declared complete on October 31, 1941.  However, Gutzon Borglum’s vision was not totally completed – original plans included head-to-waist depictions of the presidents. When Borglum died suddenly in July 1941, his son, Lincoln, tried to continue his father’s work, but funding ran out as America entered World War II. Visitors wanting to see a model of Borglum’s original dream can view it at the Sculptor’s Studio located at the Memorial.  Another part of Borglum’s grand vision was for a Hall of Records to be carved into the canyon behind the faces. Borglum envisioned a majestic room that held important documents like the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Borglum started blasting the hall, but never finished it.  On August 9, 1998, Borglum’s Hall of Records was somewhat completed when a repository was placed in the floor of the hall entry. Inside a titanium vault are sixteen porcelain enamel panels inscribed with the story of Mount Rushmore, the reasons for selecting the four presidents and a short history of the United States. The Hall of Records is not accessible to visitors, but is left as a record for people thousands of years from now.</field>

		<field name="content">The gold-domed Capitol building in  Charleston , on the banks of the Kanawha River   Once considered the southernmost of the North, the northernmost of the South, the easternmost of the West, and the westernmost of the East, West Virginia is nestled between the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east and the Ohio River to the west. Rich in natural resources, physical beauty, and traditional culture, West Virginias charm is that of being "off the beaten path". West Virginia is a destination for white water rafting, kayaking, skiing, climbing, golf, mountain biking, hiking, and off-roading. It is the only state that is entirely contained in Appalachia. Its location between the mid-west and eastern seaboard of the United States means that over 60% of the United States population lives less than 500 miles from West Virginia.  West Virginia is abundant in natural resources, being primarily known as a major producer of coal since the 1800s — in fact, its the number-two coal producing state in the US. However, it has never been a particularly wealthy state, particularly outside the larger towns; per capita income is quite low, and the poverty levels are some of the highest in the nation. From the point of view of the traveller, this isnt necessarily a negative. The people in rural areas may not have much material wealth, but theyre down-to-earth, grateful for what they have, and very friendly and hospitable, and this attitude toward life generally applies to people in the larger cities as well. Youll receive a very warm welcome, as long as you respect their Southern politeness and try to return it in kind (which means: be patient, smile, engage in small talk, and no jokes about hillbillies or inbreeding).  As a visitor, youll find that West Virginia has a lot to offer. Theres beautiful natural scenery, quaint mountain towns, delicious down-home country food, traditional handicrafts, lots of pioneer and Civil War history, outdoor activities of the rollicking and stately varieties, and great cultural opportunities. The pace of life is slow and relaxed, but with so many exciting things to do, West Virginia is a wonderful destination for a quiet getaway or a weekend adventure.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Burton was originally established in 1862 and named for John M. Burton, an early settler in the area.  The town is a rural, farming, German community with deep heritage.  The towns economy benefited from the extension of the Houston and Texas Central Railway from Brenham to Austin after the Civil War. During the 1880s Burton had three churches, a bank, a school, and a hotel, and by 1885 it had a population of 150. Burton had a population of 800 and thirty businesses by the mid-1940s. During the 1970s, however, the town declined, and its residents had dwindled to 311 by 1990.  Built on the traditions of German immigrants, Burton still holds true to its small town values.  You will be hard to find an unfriendly face or an unpleasant greeting.  Although Burton is in the middle of it all - minutes from Washington on the Brazos, a couple hours from The Alamo, an hour and half from the State Capital, and a few hours from the coast - the citizens still keep to a humble small-town life that is rare to find.</field>

Perhaps the biggest draw, however, even more than the historic museum, is the waterfront Brome Howard Inn just to the southmdash;considered by Washingtonian Magazine to be one of the D.C. metro areas top 10 inns.  Founded in 1632, St. Marys City is the fourth oldest permanent settlement in British North America and the first state capital of Maryland. It was also the first Catholic community in North America allowed to practice openly, a major milestone in the story of Americas embrace of religious freedom. The original colonists came on to the mainland from St. Clements Island and moved into dwellings in a Yaocomaco village before building there settlement here. St. Marys City grew over the years and became home to the first public buildings of Maryland, serving the provincial capital of the Maryland colony until 1708, when it was moved to  Annapolis . Nonetheless, the St. Marys City center never really caught on, as the local population was dispersed among the surrounding tobacco plantations.</field>

		<field name="content">Like many towns in the area Port Orchard was originally only accessible by boat and the town grew around the harbor.  It has since grown extensively and includes spread out suburbs and big box stores, however the downtown core has kept the original small town character and is accessible by foot from the harbor and is probably the primary area that tourists would be interested in.  From the waterfront Port Orchard offers commanding views of the Sinclair Inlet and nearby Bremerton with its historic naval shipyard.  the M.V. Carlisle II the historic Mosquito Fleet boat that shuttles passengers between Port Orchard and Bremerton.  The City is very family-friendly, with child-friendly parks, library and neighborhoods, as well as a low - and continuing to decline - crime rate.  Port Orchards identity is anchored in its connections to the past, and its vision of the future. Originally a booming lumber town called Sidney, Port Orchard became Kitsap County’s first incorporated city in 1890. It wooed the county seat away from Port Madison on Bainbridge Island in 1893 and remains the center of county government.</field>

For more excitement or variety, the cities of Vicksburg and Natchez are both an easy drive on well maintained Highway 61. The historic architecture is well worth a look if driving through this area.

Downriver to the south is the east bank of  Plaquemines Parish .   Saint Bernard was even more devastated than New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - though as many locals can tell you, the majority of the damage wasnt from the Hurricane per se (detailed below).  As of 2012 "Da Parish" is certainly back, though recovery and rebuilding are an ongoing process.  There are no incorporated communities in St. Bernard, so the names of towns and places are sometimes more a matter of what locals traditionally call a location than any legally set boundaries. (Just a heads up not to worry, for example, if that little restaurant you came across in what your road maps shows as the town of "Violet" has "Chalmette" printed on the menu and the mailing address listed as "Meraux".)</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">With water on three sides of the city, St. Pete is a superb location for fishing, sailing, and wandering beaches.  Saint Petersburg was founded by John C. Williams from Detroit, Michigan, who purchased the land in 1876. The town began with the help of Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing a railroad connection there in 1888. Saint Petersburg was named after the Saint Petersburg in Russia, the birthplace of Peter Demens. A local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city. Peter Demens won and named the city after his birthplace, while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit. The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, but it was converted into condos in 2002.  The city publishes the free "Downtown St.Petersburg Guide Map" booklet, updated each season, that contains maps, trolley routes, and listings for hundreds of museums, events, restaurants, hotels along with coupons. You can find the guide in dispensers throughout downtown and in many businesses.   The Pier—a city icon since 1973—was closed to the public in 2013.  A pier has been at the center of the St. Petersburg waterfront for over a decade. In 1973, a 4-story building in the shape of an inverted pyramid was constructed at the end of the existing pier and became a city icon for the next four decades. However, the rest of the pier structure dated to 1926 and required an increasing amount of money for repairs. In 2010, the city decided that the money needed to repair the pier and give it an additional 20 years of usable life was too much and that, instead, the pier would be entirely replaced. The inverted pyramid closed to the public on the night of May 31, 2013 and is expected to be demolished later in the year. The approach to the building will remain open for public use until then. The replacement design chosen by the city council is a modern metal-clad pedestrian walkway and amphitheater in the shape of a loop,   , expected to be opened in late 2014 or 2015. However, city residents have tried to force a vote on the replacement design and thrown up several legal challenges, which may significantly delay the construction/opening of a replacement.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The region primarily comprises Monroe County, one of the most populous of New Yorks 62 counties (9 overall, 2 upstate).  The town and village of  Victor  are in Ontario County but nonetheless constitute Rochesters southeasternmost suburb.  Likewise,  Caledonia  to the southwest is in Livingston County but maintains close ties with the Monroe County hamlet of Mumford.  Both are included here.   Rochester  is a dominating influence on the entire region, all of which lies within the Rochester Metropolitan Area, or "Greater Rochester".  Rochester serves as the primary entry point to the Finger Lakes region, so there is a strong association between the two, even though the nearest of the lakes is 20 miles to the south.  Strong association or no, most Rochesterians (a term that applies just as much to suburbanites as to city-dwellers) will place their city as part of the entire Western New York region, and not specifically as part of the Finger Lakes.  Despite that dominance, however, and the natural affinity locals feel for their central city, the initial development of the suburbs was not a matter of the citys influence overflowing its boundaries.  Rochester was formed around the same time as many other settlements in the area, and it took many years for one to rise above the others in prominence.  The catalyst for that was the Erie Canal, which was routed (after not a little bit of persuasion by the city fathers) through the tiny village of Rochesterville in 1823.  With a major transportation route running right through the middle of town, Rochesters flour mills (powered by the great falls of the Genesee) had ready access to markets both east and west.  The village boomed into a city.  New villages popped up along the Canal, with names like  Brockport ,  Spencerport , and  Fairport .  The other settlements grew too, but Rochesters centrality and natural resources made it the big winner.  Today, Rochester continues to dominate, but even city residents make a point to get out to the suburbs for festivals, boating, restaurants, and much more.</field>

It is only 15 miles to the entrance to Mesa Verde National Park. Dolores Colorado is a great place for Hunting, Biking, Fishing, Boating, Hiking, the perfect location for your next vacation.  A quaint, historic western town, there are no chain stores or Starbucks in Dolores. Turn of the century western buildings still line Central Ave. housing Antique stores, The Hollywood Bar, and the Historic Rio Grande Southern Hotel BB Restaurant.  Dolores is halfway between Durango and Telluride, where the Dolores River forms McPhee Reservoir, the second largest body of water in Colorado.  With the Dolores River running through town and mountains on both sides of the valley, Dolores is one of the truly unique vacation spots in Colorado. You will find Gold Medal flyfishing, historic western buildings, the Railroad Museum featuring the restored Galloping Goose 5, spectacular scenery on the San Juan Skyway, boating, waterskiing, camping, hiking and mile after mile of the San Juan National Forest filled with Rocky Mountain elk and mule deer.  The expedition of Fathers Dominguez and Escalante was undertaken at the time the colonies were struggling to create a nation. The Dominguez-Escalante expedition left from Santa Fe and camped at Dolores August 13, 1776. Their goal was to explore unknown lands north and west of Spanish New Mexico, open a route to Spanish missions in California and convert Indians to Spanish culture and religion. The Franciscans journal and artillery Captain Mieras maps were the first record of lands and peoples in what was to become southern Colorado and Utah.   The town of Dolores lies on the San Juan Skyway, a state and federally designated scenic highway, so awe-inspiring, it has been called Americas Most Beautiful Drive. The 236 mile loop is a perfect one-day drive. The road will take you over and around the spectacular San Juan Mountains and through the historic mining towns of Telluride, Ouray, Silverton and Durango. Ridgway, Mancos and Cortez are also along the way.</field>

The first thing youll notice is a gigantic sign on the hill between South SF (or as the locals say, "South City") and  Brisbane  which reads in block capitals: "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO THE INDUSTRIAL CITY". Yes, it is industrial, but not so much anymore. Mostly what that means is there are a bunch of warehouses and train tracks in the southeast corner of South City, and whoops now youre at the airport.   The people of South City seem to be broken down ethnically into thirds, with a third being Pan-Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and a sizable Filipino population - see  Daly City  for more), a third being Mexican/South American, and a third being white folk with a concentration of Italians.   Weatherwise, South City is on the cusp between fog and sun. Sometimes the fog is carved off by the mountain between South City and Pacifica, but other times it continues on through and keeps things cool. It can get windy in the hills any time of year.</field>

The region is primarily composed of mountains and high desert, while the Rogue Valley, Grants Pass, and Klamath regions are home to agricultural, commercial, and industrial enterprises.  Southern Oregon has become a popular retirement community over the past few decades; what was once a lumber-oriented economy has gradually adapted to service- and tourism-based businesses. Like much of Oregon, the outdoors are one of the regions most valued assets, but more visible products include pears, wine, and timber products.</field>

There is also a strong sense of regional pride here with a deep foundation in religion. Most of the residences are strict conservatives and fervently fight about their beliefs and views. It would be considered very rude to challenge these ideals. At the same time the people are generally welcoming and will do their best to make sure you feel at home, usually by offering a glass of "sweet tea".  Many of the older locals still speak in a very thick accent that can be difficult to understand. It is also considered rude to ask them to repeat something more than once. Usually it is best to discreetly ask a younger person what they have said. It is also the norm to address those older than you as "Sir" and "Maam" whenever possible and you will be looked at strangely if you dont despite this custom being so out of date even people in Utah have stopped using it.  Its also best to keep in mind that many places will be closed on Sunday as most people will be in church.</field>

The Quakers escaped from England and the religious persecution present there and settled in the land of William Penn’s Holy Experiment. The Holy experiment was an attempt by the Quakers to establish their own community. The community began to grow during the pre-revolutionary period, and while no action took place in Marple during the Revolutionary War, the growth of occupation crafts such as weavers and millers gave way to increased trade. Once the war was over, Marple returned to its farming and agrarian lifestyle.   Population in Marple began to grow rapidly after the Civil War. The Industrial Revolution brought rail transportation through the township making transportation easier around Marple and into Philadelphia. The largest period of development for Marple Township came towards the end of World War II. The improvement of roads, public transportation and the availability of the automobiles made Marple a suburban community.  Nowadays, Marple is a bustling community full of families, great restaurants, tons of shopping experiences nearby, and great attractions. Whether you are more family oriented, a history buff, a foodie or a shopaholic, Marple is a great central town to everything you need. Located 11 miles from Philadelphia and 13 miles from the King of Prussia Mall   , everything you will need is within a 30 minute car drive.</field>

In addition, its younger, student-heavy population allows it to offer a vibrant nightlife that is relatively rare in Arizona. It is home to many research-centric industries in fields ranging from biotechnology to solar energy as well as a high percentage of knowledge workers those industries require. Being surrounded by the neighboring cities of  Phoenix ,  Scottsdale ,  Mesa , and  Chandler , it serves as a major hub in the Valley Metro light rail transit system.</field>

Photography can be a challenge due to the massive size of the dam, and the inability to get far enough away before passing the relatively short horizon. If possible, bring a wide-angle lens, and avoid the hours of the day when the sun is just barely above the dam face. Unfortunately, most of the time youll be looking south and directly into the sun viewing the dam.</field>

		<field name="content">Ilwaco was first settled by Henry Feister in 1851, and was named for Elwahko Jim, the son in law of Chief Comcomly.  Ilwaco was officially incorporated on December 16, 1890. A narrow gauge railway, Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, ran for over thirty years.  The railroad ran north up First Street in Ilwaco. A published photo shows the railroads Ilwaco facilities, including a gallows turntable and elevated watering trough, were located on the southwest corner of the intersection of First and Spruce streets.  The depot was built nearby on Spruce Street. A siding was built for the Ilwaco Mill and Lumber Company.  A published photo shows the passenger depot on the west side of First Street, at a point 14.8 miles (23.8 km) from the Ilwaco Depot to Nahcotta.  The Ilwaco freight depot was in a different building. The freight depot survived to modern times, and has been relocated to became part of the Ilwaco Heritage Museum.  The train ran out on the dock in Ilwaco. Floating logs were stored behind log booms on the west side of the Ilwaco dock.  At some point after 1890, First Street had been covered with wooden planks, and remained so until 1916, when it was paved over.  By 1915, a published photo shows many more businesses along First Street.</field>

It is common to see tourists from Asia snapping pictures along with groups from tour buses. If you are visiting be sure to go to the city park and the hedge maze there along with some wonderful rustic buildings and a covered bridge. If you can make it in October, be sure to not miss the Bridges Festival in which the square is closed down and music, dancing, vendors and stories flood the town. If attending on Sunday, the Car show is incredible!  There are several wineries around that are a nice place to visit and plenty of restaurants and bakeries to eat at while visiting. There are also several bed and breakfast places as well as a motel 8. Cedar Lake is a beautiful serene lake for taking a break and enjoying the beauty of the water.  Winter time finds a decorated town with musical carols echoing from the storefronts and bundled up families wandering between shops. There is a special feeling during snowfall, of being inside a snow globe while standing there in town square. Hunting is popular (as Madison county is known for the awesome gene pool for big bucks), snowmobiling, four wheeling, paintball, football, wrestling, biking, running, fishing and a golf course are popular sports here.  Spring brings busy farmers getting crops planted and the farm in order after a long winter.</field>

It lies in the south-central portion of Salt Lake Valley, a large valley located between the Oquirrh Mountains to the west and the Wasatch Mountains to the east, where the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain regions meet. The city is largely residential, but commercial areas lie in the west part of the city and along major roads through the city, including South Town Mall and the Jordan Commons shopping center. The eastern residential regions lie along the western slopes (benches) of the Wasatch Range, and the residences become more affluent as you climb the bench. Sandy lies along the Wasatch Range, the region of nearly continuous urbanization from Brigham City south to Payson, including the cities of  Ogden ,  Salt Lake City , and  Provo .  Sandy, in particular, is friendly toward visitors. Some refer to the city as "The Ultimate Base Camp."

On September 7th, 1876, the James-Younger Gang rode into town intent on robbing the First National Bank of Northfield.  Tipped off due to their suspicious actions, the citizens of Northfield engaged in a quick but heavy firefight with the gang that left two citizens and two gang members dead.  The other six gang members sustained a range of injuries and fled south.  Four were captured two weeks later only fifty miles from Northfield.  Northfield is one of the best smelling towns in America due to the local Malt-O-Meal factory. At times the town distinctly smells of popcorn or chocolate.</field>

The closest water taxi stop is "North Williamsburg" via the East River Ferry.  Many restaurants, several popular music clubs and a burgeoning art gallery district. This is now what Greenwich Village used to be - including the artsy scene complete with eclectic galleries and off-beat bars.  East Williamsburg- Centered around the Morgan Ave stop on the L train. Seemingly a desolate industrial area, this neighborhood has surprises around every corner. Try out Robertas Pizza, which gets its ingredients for its fabulous pizzas from its own rooftop farm, and from befriended urban farms in the area. For a drink, head to The Narrows or Kings County. Many of New Yorks underground warehouse parties are thrown in this area as well.  Greenpoint- At the northwestern tip of Brooklyn, Greenpoint is the second largest Polish enclave in the United States (after Chicago), but is also home to a sizable Latino population (north of Huron St.) and a growing number of hipsters (see Franklin St.). L Magazine recently called Greenpoint the best neighborhood in all of Brooklyn. The part that quickly is getting gentrified centers around the Nassau stop on the G train. The traditional Polish part is further up Manhattan Ave and its side streets.  Get Polish food at Karczma (136 Greenpoint Av.), coffee at Ashbox (Manhattan Av. between Ash Box), brunch at Brooklyn Label (Franklin Java), Mexican at Acapulcos (Manhattan Clay). 5 Leaves, on the north-west corner of McCarren park, is one of the best restaurants of the entire city, build up with the estate that Heath Ledger left behind after he passed away.  There are lots of good Polish meat markets along Manhattan and Nassau Avs, too. For some industrial chic, walk down Java Street to its dead end at the East River for great views of Midtown.  Nearest subway: G train to Nassau Av. and Greenpoint Av. stations.  Bushwick- Rich in its own history, Bushwick is home to many brownstones, mansions, and projects alike. As a low-income neighborhood, shopping can be done on Knickerbocker Avenue, whether for clothes, appliances, or food. The newly restored Maria Hernandez Park on Knickerbocker Ave. and Suydam St. is a nice spot to bring the kids and relax in the shade of the trees. While its not like neighboring "East Williamsburg", Williamsburg, or Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick has its own sense of community, not to be confused with anything else. However violent crime is a still a concern along with the other social problems in a community with a high poverty rate.</field>

		<field name="content">alt= Aerial View Of Wickford Village   Wickford is an established seaport that seems to keep its historical charm despite the large tourist attraction. The tides lap its grounded shores and echo a story of its distinguished past. Wickford was originally a small island bounded on the north by Mill Cove (North Cove), the south by Academy Cove (South Cove), and on the east by Wickford Harbor. According to Historic Wickford, to the left of the harbor was a small body of water that connected Mill Cove and Academy Cove. In the early 1700’s the village of Lodowicke Updikewide had streets leading to the harbor. Lodowicke Updikewide is presently known as Main Street. According to Historic Wickford Inc. the name Wickford, has no known origin. Some believed the name originated from England while some believe it originated from “Wicke’s Ford” a crossing through the west boundary neck of water near Newton Avenue. Although its origin remains a mystery, Wickford was known for a time as Updike’s Newton. Historic Wickford Inc. states that in the early 1700’s the harbor was a primary port for supplying and transporting the produce of plantations. Eventually, the port expanded to facilitate shipping and shipbuilding after the Revolutionary War. This boom period was from 1780-1830, as seen from the historical houses that were built and still stand today. After the 1830’s, steamboat and railroad lines bypassed Wickford. Historic Wickford Inc. states that this helped maintain and preserve the village. In the late 19th century, Wickford experienced a revival and joined Narragansett and Newport as a summer destination. Historic Wickford Inc. states that Wickford is still a thriving village with a year-round community who work to keep its unique heritage alive.</field>

For a period the point furthest downstream that the Mississippi could be bridged was located in the area, if only due to the fortuitous island placement. Contributing to its growth was St. Anthony Falls, a natural waterfall which provided energy to working grain mills located on the Mississippi River. Due to rapid erosion of its limestone underlayment, St Anthony Falls moved upstream until it was set in concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers.</field>

It was the countrys first seaside resort and much of the original flavor still exists in the properties and other sites within the city.  Settled by whalers and fishermen in colonial times, the town suffered a devastating fire in 1878 and was rebuilt during the Victorian period.  As a result, Cape May is known for its concentration of Victorian era architecture. It was declared a national historic landmark in 1976.   A canal, dug from a natural shallow creek, runs from Cape Mays harbor to the Delaware Bay, which makes Cape May an island. In fact, historically, its known as Cape Island.  The two main industries within Cape May are tourism and fishing.  Cape May is second to Atlantic City for tourism in the state of New Jersey.  Being at the confluence of the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean allows Cape May full access to many types of fishing opportunities.    Cape May is also home to the Coast Guard Training Station.</field>

In the middle lies Hagerstown Valley, part of Cumberland Valley which is part of a larger Great Appalachian Valley. Washington County is noted for small towns dotting its idyllic rural landscape and abundant agricultural fields. It boasts only one city, its county seat Hagerstown. However, the county is part of the Hagerstown metropolitan area, and it is proximate to and becoming increasingly influenced by  Washington, D.C.  and  Baltimore .  Washington County is also well-known for being located in a historically significant area. Antietam, South Mountain, Gettysburg, Harpers Ferry, and Monocacy are Civil War battlefields all located within 30 minutes drive of the county. The county is also home to the restored American Revolutionary War and French and Indian War structure of Fort Frederick.  Even with such historical significance, retail is the major draw for tourism in Washington County. Prime Outlets Hagerstown boasts over 100 stores and draws people from neighboring counties as well as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. The county also has several malls and other shopping centers drawing people from neighboring communities in Western Maryland, Southern Pennsylvania, and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.</field>

Erie County includes one island,  Kelleys Island , and has a long shoreline on Lake Erie running from Bay View east to Vermillion. In the early days the shoreline was quite rough and swampy. Today, it is the site of  Cedar Point  in  Sandusky  and the location of some of the most expensive residential property in Ohio.  Cold Creek Pond   Cold Creek , starts as an underground river, lacking normal oxygen levels, that rises first at Castalia, Ohio south of the business district and forms a pond, where the water, which remains at a constant 48 degrees year around flows north to  Sandusky , where it enters Sandusky Bay and then Lake Erie. The places where the water rises to the surface are similar to the cenotes in the   Yucatán  and the two areas share a similar Karst geological sub-surface of limestone. From Castalia, north, there are several of these "cenotes" or springs that vary in size. Some have been explored by divers and they have not been able to determine the depth or scope of the rivers. Today, most are on private property and access is a bit difficult. The small ones at Castalia are not difficult to visit, as they are in a public park. Another example of this can be found a short distance away at Seneca Caverns.</field>

Cassadaga    , Florida is well known for having a large number of psychics and "Spiritualist Mediums", and as such is sometimes referred to as being the "Psychic Center of the World".  The village exists as an entity unto itself way off Interstate 4 (you won’t find it unless you’re looking for it) between Orlando and Daytona Beach. Its founder, George Colby, was led through the wilderness by three spirit guides to what is now the site of the Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp. On that site, the guides instructed him to establish  a Spiritualist Camp, which was completed in 1894. It is a place like no other, where,  Spiritualist Mediums and Spiritualist Healers can live in peace without interference from the world outside their gates.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The town was settled by European colonists in 1635 as a village within the boundaries of Cambridge, Massachusetts, named Menotomy, an Algonquian word meaning "swift running water". A somewhat larger area, including surrounding land, was incorporated on February 27, 1807 as West Cambridge. In 1867, the name "Arlington" was chosen in honor of those buried in Arlington National Cemetery; the name change took effect that April 30. Mill Brook, which historically figured largely into Arlingtons economy, flows through the town. In 1637 Captain George Cooke built the first mill on the brook. Subsequently, seven mills were built along the stream, including the Old Schwamb Mill, which survives to this day.  Paul Reveres famous midnight ride to alert colonists took him through Menotomy. Later on that first day of the American Revolution, more blood was shed in Menotomy than in the battles of Lexington and Concord combined. Minutemen from surrounding towns converged on Menotomy to ambush the British on their retreat from Concord and Lexington. All in all, 25 colonials were killed in Menotomy (half of all Americans killed in the days battles), as well as 40 British troops (more than half their fatalities). The colonial soldiers are buried in Arlingtons Old Burying Ground/  The Jason Russell House, a yellow colonial, is today a museum which remembers those twelve Americans, including Russell himself, who were killed in and around the house on April 19, 1775. Bullet holes are visible in the interior walls to this day.  In its early years, Arlington was a thriving farming community and had its own lettuce that was quite popular. Arlington had a large ice industry on Spy Pond from the mid-19th century until the advent of refrigeration. The farms were subdivided in the mid-to-late twentieth century. In 1979, the first spreadsheet software program, VisiCalc, was developed by Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin in the attic of the Arlington apartment rented by Frankston. Today Arlington is largely residential, with many residents employed in Cambridge, Boston and surrounding towns.</field>

The early economy of Medford consisted of multiple glass and iron factories, as well as sawmills, gunpowder plants, furnaces, and farms.  Today, Medford has multiple small businesses that span nearly all industries, with the exception of factories or moderate-to-heavy industry.

It is named for Antoine LeClaire, who developed a large part of the Iowa Quad Cities on property that was given him by the tribes who originally laid claim to it.  The town was the head of the Rock Island Rapids, a notorious section of the river that extended as far south as what is now downtown Davenport.  River pilots were required to guide river traffic through the rapids, which impacted the early economic life of the town.  The rapids were tamed by the development of the lock and dams on the upper river.  The town is also the boyhood home of frontiersman Buffalo Bill Cody.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Charles Towne, as it was first called, was established in 1670 by Anthony Ashley Cooper on the west bank of the Ashley River, Charles Towne Landing, a few miles northwest of the present downtown. By 1680, the settlement had grown and moved to its present peninsular location.    Around 1690, the English colonists erected a fortification wall around the small settlement to aid in its defense. The wall sheltered the area, in the present French Quarter, from Cumberland St. south to Water St., from Meeting St. east to East Bay St.  The wall was destroyed around 1720.  Cobblestone lanes and one building remain from this colonial English Walled Town: the Powder Magazine, where the towns supply of gunpowder was stored.  Remnants of the colonial wall were found beneath the Old Exchange Building.   Luckily, Charleston was re-captured in the Civil War without much property damaged, and it was the first city in the U.S. to pass a historical preservation ordinance.  Thus, much of the beautiful architecture, from early Colonial, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate to Victorian, remains for future generations to see and enjoy.  Charleston is also known as The Holy City due to the numerous church steeples, which dot the citys low-rise skyline, and the fact that it was one of the few places in the original thirteen colonies to provide religious tolerance to the French Huguenots as well as to Jews.  Charleston is in general a laid-back, but sophisticated, city and has an old-South feel, just like its neighbor,  Savannah . Most people in Charleston are helpful when approached in a polite manner. If a traveler speaks little English, Charlestonians are still generally willing to help as best they can.  It is advisable, however, to at least learn a few key English phrases, and perhaps carry a travelers phrasebook.</field>

It is considered to be the southernmost city in the  Knowledge Corridor  region, featuring an inordinate number of prestigious universities and 120,000 university students. Middletown features a large variety of restaurants (3 Mexican places, 3 Indian places, 2 Thai places, a Tibetan place and uncountable Italian places.)   There is one major college -  Wesleyan University  - located up the hill from downtown but aside from the restaurants and bars on Main Street, there arent many things for college students to do right in Middletown. Where are the bookstores? The import clothing stores? Well, there may be one or two but theyre hiding. To find the heart of Middletown youve got to do a little snooping around.  There are excellent resources here for those with an artistic bent. The Buttonwood Tree is an intimate performance art space on the North End of Main St. Oddfellows Playhouse provides a start in the world of theater for kids of all ages. Then theres Kid City - sort of an exploratorium - a great place to take your kids on a rainy afternoon. And of course all the cultural offerings of Wesleyan University. A few years ago it was rated one of the 100 best art towns in America.  Middletown is also the home to Connecticut Valley Hospital, the major psychiatric facility for southern  New England . So if you see a few questionable people on the streets, relax, theyre outpatients and theyre probably properly medicated.</field>

Here, human achievements are celebrated through imagination, wonders of enterprise and concepts of a future that promises new and exciting benefits for all. May EPCOT Center entertain, inform and inspire and above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in mans ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere." mdash; E. Cardon Walker, October 24, 1982   Walt Disney World s second theme park opened October 1, 1982, as EPCOT Center, joining the  Magic Kingdom .  Often likened to a "permanent worlds fair", Epcot is divided into two distinct areas, Future World and World Showcase.  World Showcase features eleven different countries, focusing on authentic food and merchandise, each one hosted by citizens of that country.  Dont miss the impossibly cheesy but fun Mexico ride, or the extravagant Maelstrom ride in the Norway pavilion.  Future World comprises a variety of attractions, each one highlighting one aspect of human progress.  The "future" in this case is not the fantasy of the Magic Kingdoms Tomorrowland, but the promise of a future in which communication, imagination, and conservation have become mankinds foremost values.  Test Track and Mission: SPACE are the most thrilling of the attractions.  The latest addition is Soarin39;, a simulated hang-gliding adventure through Californian landscapes.  Epcot is sometimes derided as an "educational park", and though it is perhaps the most cerebral of the four theme parks, its all presented in the usual entertaining Disney style.  Its true that Epcot may appeal more to adults and older children, but young ones arent exactly left out; theyll enjoy the character greetings and the Kidcot Fun Stops as well as the more colorful and character-filled rides like The Seas with Nemo Friends.  Just outside Epcots International Gateway is Disneys BoardWalk, a nightlife and shopping area themed as a mid-Atlantic beach community.</field>

Tradition holds that the first settlers of Richmond were a married couple, John Babcock and Mary Lawson, whose son James was the first non-Native American child born in Narragansett territory. (The story is likely a later invention.)  Richmonds economy was based on textile manufacturing from the mid-1800s through the 1960s. Today the town serves mainly as a bedroom community for commuters working in Providence, Warwick and eastern Connecticut.</field>

On July 8, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was read in Eastons Centre Square, one of three public readings of the document. Every year, Easton celebrates this historic event with its Heritage Day celebration, held in July.  Easton became a primary commercial location during the canals and railroads era of the 1800s. The Delaware, Morris and Lehigh canals were vital for transportation of goods. The railroads replaced the canals for transportation and five railroads served Easton. The city had a strong German heritage. During Prohibition, it was known for nightlife and had plenty of liquor and a large number of brothels.    The population in Easton continues to diversify. Between the 1990 and 2000 censuses, the Hispanic and Black populations increased siginificantly. However, the primiary ethnicity in the city remains White/non-Hispanic.</field>

Santas Workshop opened on July 1, 1949, six years before  Disneyland  (1955), serving as a model for many theme parks of the 1950s. A postal substation was opened as "North Pole NY" in 1953 and remains open seasonally. It is possible to purchase a letter from Santa with the North Pole postmark.page=1 -->  The hamlet once claimed to have its own television station ( Plattsburgh s NBC affiliate, which once transmitted a powerful analogue TV signal from a mountaintop in this area as "WPTZ 5 North Pole", no longer has any tie to the tiny crossroads). The "North Pole" was not the studio location, but appeared on the stations license for decades as the closest settlement to the former analogue transmitter site.</field>

Mrs. Lorinda Scammon was very religious and wished to have the place named Mount Zion. Another early settler, Samuel James, suggested "Montesano" as having a more pleasant sound and meaning about the same. The suggestion was approved and soon after a post office was secured with the name Montesano.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Montrose is the second-largest town in western Colorado. Located on the valley floor, Montrose is surrounded by the photogenic mountain ranges of the Uncompahgre Plateau to the west and snow-capped San Juan mountains to the south.  The Uncompahgre Valley was the ancestral home of the Ute nation. But in the late 1870s, the lure of the gold and silver deposits in the area proved too great for the white settler population to resist. Tensions boiled over with the Meeker Massacre in 1879. Pushed to the breaking point by the Federal governments attempts to disband their nomadic way of life, the Utes killed several whites and launched the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to  Utah , and the southwest corner of Colorado, near  Cortez .   Two months after the Utes were evicted, in December 1881, the town was founded. In the early days, Montrose was known variously as Pomona, Dad’s Town, and Uncompahgre Town.   Eventually, the town was named after Sir Walter Scotts historic novel, "A Legend of Montrose" because the area reminded Joseph Selig, the town founder, of Scotlands lake country.   Montrose served as a supply depot to service mining towns like  Ouray ,  Silverton ,  Telluride  and  Durango  in the San Juans, raising cattle and sheep to feed the miners. By 1882, the Denver Rio Grande Railroad Co built a narrow gauge railroad from Montrose to Silverton.   Besides mining and ranching, orchards were a part of the areas agricultural history. The mines went into decline, and agriculture became the center of Montroses economy. Settlers worked the fertile valley soil producing fruits, grains and vegetables. By the late 20th century, grape growers had discovered the areas potential for raising white wine varietals, and Colorados wine industry migrated south from  Grand Junction  and  Palisade . The West Elks American Viticultural Area was formed in 2001. Ranging from 5,400 feet (1646 m) to 6,400 feet (1951 m) above sea level, West Elks comprises the highest vineyards in North America.   Montrose now serves as a recreational hub for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts. Leisure travelers can hike, camp or enjoy boating and fishing in the surrounding national parks, forests and recreation areas. The town is a laid back mix of ranchers, farmers, ski bums, aging hippies and jocks.  The busy tourist months are in the summer, with most travelers just passing through in the winter on their way to  Crested Butte  and  Telluride .</field>

Officially, the "Joplin metropolitan area" (the 4th largest in Missouri)is Jasper and Newton Counties in Missouri. However, given its location at the confluence of three states, it is quite common for many people in Kansas and Oklahoma (as well as other parts of southwest Missouri) to frequent Joplin, for work and pleasure.   Other cities and towns that comprise the Joplin area include:   Webb City    Carthage   Carl Junction  Loma Linda  Leawood  Neosho  Seneca   Duenweg    Pittsburg , KS   Galena , KS   Baxter Springs , KS   Miami , OK  Joplin is approximately 40 miles north of the Arkansas state line.

		<field name="content">Lancaster is home to a very diverse group of people. It is a strong agricultural town with various farmlands all over. It is a scenic place with lush vegetation and great produce. This is because the Amish dwell in and around Lancasters many townships. The Amish are fairly isolated from the rest of the community, but they are acknowledged, respected, and not bothered. They are masters of farming and simple living, for they dont use electricity. They teach in their own schools, and they have their own churches. They get around by horse and buggy and they are easily seen, wearing black suits, hats, and bonnets. But that is not all Lancaster has to offer. Lancaster has evolved from Pennsylvanias capital back in 1799, before Harrisburg was named the capital in 1813, to a strong and well known city in Pennsylvania. It is actually the oldest inland city in the U.S. Lancaster has grown into a modern and attractive city that has something to offer for all people of all ages. From the farms to downtown Lancaster city, you will enjoy Lancaster.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">As the first stopping point of the New England settlers on the Mayflower, Provincetown was a colonial port, but remained small compared to other Yankee trading towns until the 19th century.  The town became prosperous in the 1800s as a fishing and whaling center. The population was bolstered by a number of Portuguese sailors, many of whom were from the  Azores , and came to live in Provincetown after being hired to work on US ships.  Today, the town is a hub for whale watching vessels, which provide excellent opportunities to see whales.  After the 1898 Portland Gale severely damaged the towns fishing industry, members of the towns art community took over many of the abandoned buildings. By the early decades of the 20th century, the town had acquired an international reputation for its artistic and literary output.  Some of the most famous literary lights and artists who lived in Provincetown included playwrights Tennessee Williams, Eugene ONeill, and Susan Glaspell; Artists Marsden Hartley, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning, and Jackson Pollock; Norman Mailer, author, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and co-founder of the Village Voice and beat poet Harry Kemp.  Today, the town is well-known for off-beat, queer and left of center writers and media personalities, including filmmaker John Waters; Michael Cunningham, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Hours; Andrew Sullivan, author, columnist for the Daily Beast; and blogger Andy Towle, poet and founder of Towleroad.com; Kate Clinton, comedian and writer; Kurt Vonnegut, writer; and Anthony Bourdain, chef, author, television host.  Because of its status as the first artists colony in the U.S., the town has a strong ethic of tolerance which supported the development of a large gay community from the 1960s on.  Today it is quite common to see same-sex couples showing affection and one can expect to encounter men in drag, particularly on Commercial Street, which is the main string of restaurants, shops and galleries. In general, however, the towns attitude of tolerance extends to heterosexuals, who are increasingly present and are welcome in most establishments.</field>

		<field name="content">The area now known as Cherry Hill was originally settled by the Lenni-Lenape Native Americans who coexisted peacefully with the first settlers from England, Quaker followers of William Penn who arrived in the late 1600s. The first settlement was a small cluster of homes named Colestown, on the perimeter of what is now the Colestown Cemetery on the corner of Route 41 which is also known as Kings Highway and Church Road. The municipality was founded on February 25, 1844, in Gloucester County as Delaware Township from half of the area of Waterford Township, and became part of Camden County at its creation some two weeks later on March 13, 1844. The township underwent explosive growth in the post-World War II era, with continued population growth until the 1980s. Today, the municipalitys population remains stable with new development generally occurring in small pockets of custom luxury homes or through the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of existing commercial and industrial areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was settled in 1607 by an English settler named Capt. Christopher Newport and Capt. John Smith. The site was previously inhabited by the Powhatan Indians. It was named Richmond after the London suburb of Richmond-upon-Thames by its founder William Byrd II. The settlement did not become a city until 1742, and in the 135 years in between served as little more than a trading post for furs, hides, and tobacco. In 1782 Richmond became the state capital of Virginia.   Richmond is one of the oldest American cities. The Shockoe Bottom entertainment area is where slave rebellion leader Gabriel had his head hung from a pike.  During the Civil War, it served as the capital of the Confederacy. When the Northern Army invaded Richmond, the fleeing Confederate government set fires to the citys munitions stores and government records they were unable to take with them. The fire grew out of control when winds picked up, and most of the city burned. The soldiers from the Union helped to put out the fires upon their arrival. The day after the city fell, Abraham Lincoln made a visit to the city. Though much of its colonial past has disappeared, it is rich in Civil War history and lore. There are, among other things, a Civil War prison site on Belle Isle, the house Robert E. Lee lived in, the state Capitol (which Thomas Jefferson designed and said was inspired by the Maison Carrée at  Nimes ,  France ) which served as the Confederate Capitol during the war, a museum of the Confederacy, the original Confederate White House, and Hollywood Cemetery in the heart of the city where more than 18,000 Confederate soldiers are laid to rest. Richmond has the most forged iron outside of New Orleans, and one of the first African American neighborhoods (Jackson Ward).</field>

Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideas, dreams and the hard facts that have created America, with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world." mdash; Walt Disney, July 17, 1955  :"To all who believe in the power of dreams, welcome. Disneys California Adventure opens its golden gates to you. Here we pay tribute to the dreamers of the past, the native people, explorers, immigrants, aviators, entrepreneurs and entertainers who built the Golden State. And we salute a new generation of dreamers who are creating the wonders of tomorrow, from the silver screen to the computer screen, from the fertile farmlands to the far reaches of space. Disneys California Adventure celebrates the richness and the diversity of California, its land, its people, its spirit and, above all, the dreams that it continues to inspire." mdash; Michael Eisner, February 8, 2001  The Disneyland Resort is divided into two separate theme parks, three hotels, and a shopping and entertainment district. The first park is the original Disney theme park Disneyland, which opened on July 18, 1955. Its sister park Disney California Adventure, which opened in February 2001, is located across the entry plaza on the former site of Disneylands parking lot. Both parks are divided into "lands", or themes. At the western end of the entry plaza is Downtown Disney, the shopping and entertainment district. The three hotels are located at the west end of Downtown Disney.  There is one main difference between the Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, and that is in Anaheim, there are many non-Disney hotels, restaurants and shops just a short distance from the parks main entrance.  Disneylands rides are generally considered classic well-themed dark rides (e.g. Pirates of the Caribbean) with the occasional thrill ride (e.g. Space Mountain), while California Adventures rides are more thrill-oriented (e.g. California Screamin) with some some family-style rides (e.g. Soarin Over California). The Cast Members (employees) in all sections of the park are widely known to be very friendly and helpful. The attention to detail throughout the parks is extraordinary; however, most Cast Members will not know the history behind the details.  The two biggest problems with the Disneyland Resort as a whole are crowds and price. However with careful planning, both can be avoided.  Disneyland is one of the most visited theme parks in the world (with 15.98 million visits in 2010, based on the TEA/ERA figures, second only to the  Magic Kingdom  at  Walt Disney World ), so the parks can be pretty crowded, especially during the weekends, summer, and winter holidays, which leads to long lines for the most popular attractions. However, if you visit in the late winter or early spring, off-season lines can be short, especially during the weekdays. Disney California Adventure has fewer attractions but still has long lines, although not as long as Disneylands attractions.  Eating outside the parks is quite possible due to the close vicinity of several restaurants to the park and the benefit of hand-stamp and re-entry. Stick to just snacks and maybe one meal in the park, and you can save some cash.</field>

Reeds Ferry and Thornton Ferry were named for the ferries which operated between Merrimack and Litchfield. There were taverns near the ferries to accommodate the travelers.

The city is the 29th largest city in population in the nation (506,132 in the 2000 census), and the largest city in the 5 "plains states" (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota). After decades of suburban sprawl and an ill-fated downtown "urban renewal", a sudden burst of investment in the 1990s has given the city additional big city attractions as well as a pleasant quality of life that often is the envy if not surprise of visitors from other cities, making Oklahoma City more of a tourist destination in and of itself.

The state capitol is Pierre (pronounced “peer”), which is located almost exactly in the center of the state.  South Dakota is home to Mount Rushmore National Memorial. In 1927, sculptor Gutzon Borglum came to the Black Hills to carve his masterpiece into the side of a granite mountain. Today, visitors from all over the world come to western South Dakota to see the 60-foot faces of four American Presidents.  South Dakota is a popular family vacation destination. In addition to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, other popular stops are Custer State Park, Crazy Horse Memorial, Deadwood, the World’s Only Corn Palace, Badlands National Park, Fort Sisseton Historic State Park, Wall Drug and Lewis and Clark Recreation Area. In De Smet, visitors can still tour the childhood homestead of beloved “Little House on the Prairie” author Laura Ingalls Wilder. Pierre’s Cultural Heritage Center houses the Museum of the South Dakota State Historical Society, which preserves the history of the State of South Dakota and Dakota Territory.  South Dakota has a rich history going back to the days of the dinosaurs. One of the most complete T. rex skeletons was found in South Dakota and the largest collection of Columbian Wooly Mammoth fossils are still being unearthed at The Mammoth Site in Hot Springs in the southern Black Hills. Visitors to Badlands National Park can learn about what is considered to be one of the richest fossil beds in the country.  South Dakota is home to the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota-speaking people of the Great Sioux Nation. Several museums and cultural centers across the state depict the history and traditions of these people as well as display ancient artifacts and modern artwork. Across the state, visitors can explore the Native American Scenic Byway, attend a traditional powwow and experience Native American culture.  The Black Hills, called “Paha Sapa” by the Native Americans, is considered sacred ground to many tribes across the country. The Lakota Nation believes all life comes from “Paha Sapa,” and they fought fiercely to protect it during the Indian Wars of the 1800s. One of the most sacred places is Bear Butte in the northern Black Hills. This formation of magma never erupted and looks like a giant sleeping bear. Now a state park, Bear Butte is still used as a place of worship for more than 60 Native American tribes. More than 62,000 Native Americans currently live in South Dakota.  In 1874, an expedition led by General Custer discovered gold for the first time in the Black Hills and incited a gold rush. The largest find was near the town of present day Lead. In 2002, after yielding gold for more than 120 years, the Homestake Gold Mine shut down mining operations, but the location was recently named the proposed site for the National Science Foundation’s Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). Currently, the Sanford Laboratory at Homestake is conducting experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the site for DUSEL.  Agriculture continues to be the mainstay of South Dakota’s economy. Eastern South Dakota supports a variety of crops, while cattle and sheep ranching are prevalent on the drier, western plains. South Dakota is a leading producer of honey, oats, rye, sunflowers, spring wheat, soybeans, corn, beef cattle, hogs, buffalo and sheep.  Interstate 90 runs east to west across South Dakota, while Interstate 29 runs north to south near the eastern border. Interstate Information Centers are staffed in the summer months and offer a variety of travel and tourism information. The state has two major airports located in Rapid City in the west and Sioux Falls in the east. Rapid City is on the eastern edge of the Black Hills, approximately 25 miles from Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Sioux Falls is located at the intersection of Interstates 29 and 90. Aberdeen, Pierre and Watertown also have airports with limited service by major carriers.</field>

Blackhawk quickly became the milling center for the gold ore mined throughout the county. City leaders banded together with Central City and Cripple Creek on the 1990 Colorado ballot to allow limited stakes gambling in the commercial districts of the towns. The measure passed and gaming began on October 1, 1991. In 2008 additional legislation was introduced to raise the betting limit, introduce new table games and allow casinos to stay open 24 hours.</field>

		<field name="content">North Dakota is a large, sparsely populated state.  It was settled mainly by farmers of Scandinavian and German descent.  North Dakotas population has scarcely changed since 1915, but its urban-to-rural ratio has changed dramatically over the years.  One-sixth of the people in the state live in Fargo, and that figure is growing all the time. The states economy is based on its agriculture, food processing, mining, tourism and machinery.  North Dakota is the least-visited state in the union, not surprising given its location.  But there is something to be found for those willing to venture into the unknown. North Dakota is living proof that there is much to see and do off the beaten tourist path and in small towns. Outdoor activities abound year round: hiking, biking, camping (tent and RV), boating, fishing, sailing, tubing, birding, photography, cross country skiing, snowmobiling, hunting, archery, and more. If you fancy disc golf, there are fourteen regulation courses in the state. Or you can simply take a scenic drive through hills and lakes, badlands, or plains. Military buffs will enjoy visiting the old frontier forts. Nature lovers can see hundreds of species of birds, animals, fish, and wildflowers. Geological formations of almost every type are here. You can dig for fossils or hunt for unique mineral specimens.  North Dakota is a significant state to Native Americans. It holds many holy-sites that are important to Native American History, and Spirituality. It has been reported that many of these holy sites have been abused by tourists. Some reports include tourists using the Native Americans holy sites as restrooms. North Dakota is known to be untouched, most of these holy sites are yet to be discovered. When visiting these Native American holy sites, it is recommended to NEVER take an object off the ground especially if it resembles Native American art, these objects are hopefully going to continue being undisturbed in the vast graveyard known as North Dakota.    Famous North Dakotans include: former CBS newsman Eric Sevareid (Velva, ND), actress Angie Dickinson (Kulm, ND), "Fever" singer Peggy Lee (Jamestown, ND), "bubbling machine" bandleader Lawrence Welk (Strasburg, ND), and author Louis LAmour (Jamestown, ND).</field>

		<field name="content">right   The Lower Peninsula has the majority of the population (primarily in the south), while the Upper Peninsula, separated from it by Lake Michigan and a bit of Lake Huron, is mostly rural. Until 1957, the only way to drive from one to the other was to go all the way around Lake Michigan, or take your car onto a ferry.  Each Michigander carries a map of the state at all times. Stick out your right hand (palm toward you) and you have a map of the Lower Peninsula. Stick out your left hand (again with your palm facing you, fingers pointing to the right) and you have an approximate map of the Upper Peninsula. Dont be surprised if a resident tells you where a city is by pointing at their hand. And, dont be surprised to hear the Lower Peninsula referred to as "the Mitten", or the Upper Peninsula shortened to "the U.P.".  Residents of the U.P. refer to residents of the Lower Peninsula, usually jokingly, as "Trolls," because they live under (south of) the (Mackinac) Bridge. Residents of both peninsula refer to U.P. residents as "Yoopers," a tag many U.P. residents wear with pride.   While Michigans economy is most well known for its auto industry, it also has a long history of logging and copper- and iron ore-mining.  The Michigan economy has diversified somewhat as the automotive industry and suppliers have moved their facilities elsewhere.  Michigan agricultural output includes cherries, apples, blueberries, navy beans, and petunias, plus a wide variety of other crops.  Outdoor sports are an important part of the tourism industry in Michigan, with skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling in winter, and fishing, swimming, camping, and bicycling in summer. Visitors also enjoy photography, birdwatching, and hiking throughout the year, especially in or near the states extensive forests, beaches, lakes, and rivers.  Hunting, fishing, camping, and sailing are also popular outdoor activities.  The vast majority of Michiganders tend to be very friendly, with a few exceptions. If you are identified as a tourist in certain areas (especially small, lakeside towns), you may be met with resentment. This is more common among Michigan residents who live in formerly unspoiled regions of immense natural beauty which have recently been overtaken with condominium developments, large hotels, and other commercial buildings meant to capitalize on tourism.</field>

Known as the City of Roses, Pasadena is most famous for its New Years Day Rose Parade and Rose Bowl Game.  The number of people in the city balloons every year after Christmas as visitors come from all over to decorate and view the floats, as well as to attend arguably the most famous college football bowl game of the year.  Pasadena has become the most exciting place for nightlife in the San Gabriel Valley. With bustling Old Pasadenas 200 boutiques, national retailers, restaurants and clubs in the western section, chic shopping and dining on South Lake and abundant services in the eastern area, Pasadena is really the place to be!  As the birthplace of Julia Child and home to 500 restaurants serving cuisine from around the world, Pasadena is a real find for foodies. Adding to its culinary credentials, one of only 15 Le Cordon Bleu-affiliated culinary schools in the United States resides here. In addition, the first Trader Joe’s neighborhood market opened its doors in Pasadena in 1967. That same store on Arroyo Parkway is still serving customers today.  Pasadena is a cultural oasis with 14 museums and 11 performing arts organizations, including the Pasadena Playhouse and Norton Simon Museum. Pasadena also boasts the world-renowned California Institute of Technology, whose alumni and faculty have garnered 32 Nobel Prizes. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, site of the Mars exploration missions, is also just a 10-minute drive north.  Most visitors to Pasadena will also not want to miss the nearby Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens which features a large art collection but is more famous for its 150 acres of botanical gardens that have been used as a backdrop for many Hollywood films.</field>

The city became the capital of the newly-created Idaho Territory in 1863, but lost the distinction to  Boise  shortly thereafter in what proved to be an enormously unpopular decision in northern Idaho. To this day it is not unusual to hear locals lament losing the capital to Boise.  Like  Pocatello , Lewiston has a strong working-class heritage. Industries related to timber and logging pursuits have long been key to the citys economy. Because the Columbia and later the Snake River are navigable by some ocean-going vessels all the way to Lewiston, the city has the distinction of being Idahos only port city as well as the furthest inland port in the western United States. Its also easy for visitors to confuse Lewistons two main rivers. The Clearwater River is on the north side, and runs straight into the Snake River. However, the Snake on the citys west side makes a left turn at this point, going into neighboring  Clarkston ,  Washington .</field>

The Park is defined by the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile long wrinkle in the earths crust known as a monocline.  The Fold extends from nearby Thousand Lakes Mountain to the Colorado River (now  Lake Powell ).  Capitol Reef National Park was established to protect this grand and colorful geologic feature, as well as the unique natural and cultural history found in the area.  The name was derived from the rounded sandstone buttes which resemble capitol domes and from the long line of rocky cliffs which are a barrier to travel, like a coral reef.</field>

		<field name="content">For purposes of this article, North (Arizona) is taken to be everything in the state north of Interstate highway 40 (following the historic  Route 66 ), west of (and including)  Winslow  and east of  Kingman . The region also extends southward along I-17 from  Flagstaff  toward  Phoenix , to include attractions within 20 miles or so of the highway north of  Greater Phoenix . This definition is arbitrary, as region definitions for this state vary.  This is a geographically diverse area that contains not only the famous  Grand Canyon  but also some mountainous country near Flagstaff and lesser canyon/mesa terrain to the east and west.  Part of  Navajo Nation  falls within this region.  There are a number of  national parks and monuments  here, many of them either clustered around Flagstaff or within Navajo Nation.  Flagstaff makes a good base of operations from which to explore these attractions, most of which do not feature lodging themselves.  The northernmost part of this region is separated from the rest of it by the Grand Canyon and is known as the "Arizona Strip" - no relation to the "Strip" in  Las Vegas , although that city isnt far away as the crow flies.  Getting to the Arizona Strip from elsewhere in northern Arizona can be tricky owing to the obvious logistical difficulties imposed by the Canyon, and as a result, it has acquired a cultural identity that in many regards has more to do with southern  Utah  than with the rest of Arizona.  First settled by Mormon pioneers, the area features several areas of interest such as Pipe Spring National Monument, a onetime Mormon outpost, and  Colorado City , a polygamist community on the Arizona-Utah border.</field>

"Jackson Hole" refers to either the greater valley area (including, for example, the towns of Wilson and Kelly) or the Jackson Hole ski resort.       Jackson transforms from a popular ski town during the winter into a mecca for travelers here to admire and participate in boundless summer beauty and activities. Meanwhile, in the spring and fall seasons, the town slows down as only the 6,000 or so year-round residents remain (and many of them may leave during this time as well) and many of the hotels and restaurants close for the season.  Each of the seasons have their pluses and minuses depending on the visitors expectations and desires, but it pays to know what time of year is best for what activity, especially in Jacksons unique high-altitude environment.

The Paterson falls were a key element in the success of Paterson as the industrial leader of the nation during this time. The 77 foot falls power was harnessed and provided power for the numerous industries located in Paterson. Paterson was a rich city and enjoyed success through out the late 1700s, 1800s and early 1900s (up until the 1950s). Paterson was nicknamed the silk city for its dominant role in production in silk during the mid 1800s.  The city began to see a decline during the 1960s and 1970s which was due to several factors. One, many industries during this time began moving to the Midwest, at the same time, many African Americans were moving into the city from the south. Factories were closing at the same time African Americans moving in looking for employment. Many white residents began leaving the city due to the declining economy. The opening of malls in nearby Paramus and Wayne also took away significant business from the citys downtown shopping district.   With a crippling economy and high unemployment rate, Paterson was becoming a ghetto. During the 1980s, crime increased significantly in the city. Crime rates dropped in the 1990s, but still remains high. There are many current efforts underway to help revive the city. Despite the citys bad reputation, high crime rates, and poverty, there are a lot of places and things to do in this city. The city is very diverse and contains a very high population of Hispanics of all nationalities, African Americans, Italian Americans, and Arabs. There are numerous parks, ethnic places to eat, shop, hang out, and to see.</field>

Fortunes were made, big houses and stores were built, and the town grew.  As the trees ran out, dairy farming took over in the surrounding country and the businesses in town shifted to serve the farmers.    Fortunately, things were prosperous enough in later years to keep the heart of town alive, but not prosperous enough to fund tearing down and rebuilding, as happened in some other places.  So today the old part of Neillsville has almost a Tom-Sawyer feel on a warm summer afternoon.</field>

However, it is perhaps best known as the setting for the novel, and subsequent films, The Amityville Horror, which was based on the 1974 murders that occurred in the town; though the scene itself tries hard not to be a tourist attraction for that reason alone.  The population was 9,441 at the 2000 census.</field>

		<field name="content">El Segundo is one of the oldest cities in the Los Angeles area.  It is generally accepted that the city is named after the second (el segundo) Standard Oil refinery on the West Coast, built in 1911.  El Segundo is two cities in one.  The coastal portion is a residential suburb with a charming Main Street which looks frozen in time.  Locals both affectionately and derisively call it "Mayberry By The Sea", referring to the sleepy fictional town  which was the setting for the American television show "The Andy Griffith Show" in the early 1960s.  The "inland portion" of El Segundo is a thriving business district.  Many large aerospace companies have facilities in El Segundo, including Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and The Aerospace Corporation, which is headquartered there. It is also home to the Los Angeles Air Force Base and the Space and Missile Systems Center and Toy Manufacturer Mattel.  El Segundo is also home to the blue butterfly, now an endangered species.These butterflies which once used to reside in the sand dunes of El Segundo over an area of 4.5 square miles have now been pushed into three small areas of what is left of those dunes.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Bronx - often abbreviated as BX, and nicknamed The Boogie Down - with a population of 1,385,108 (2010 US Census), is the only New York borough on the mainland of the United States. It was originally part of Westchester County but was gradually annexed by New York City. The Bronx was completely incorporated into New York City in 1898.  The Bronx is the only borough attached to the rest of the mainland New York State, and its the only borough with “the” as part of its name. Thats because in the early 1600s a Dutch settler, Jonas Bronck, bought the land from the Native Americans who occupied the territory at the time. Whenever other land owner in the area wanted to travel to that area they would call it “The Bronck’s Land.” At first he planned to use the land to grow tobacco crops, but it was too hilly and a marshy terrain, and therefore couldn’t grow anything on it.  The Bronx has a strong character all its own. It is the birthplace of hip hop music and home to one of the countrys most storied professional baseball teams, the New York Yankees, also known as the "Bronx Bombers." Many ethnic groups have called the Bronx home over the years. Arthur Avenue is still a center of Italian American culture in New York, and many claim it has a more authentic feel than Manhattans Little Italy. The South Bronx is a center of Puerto Rican culture and life, with a growing Mexican community as well. University Heights and Morris Heights are largely Dominican neighborhoods, while Woodlawn maintains a large population of Irish  immigrants.  While the southern and central Bronx are mostly comprised of apartment buildings and densely built, the physical environment of the Bronx is much more varied than what is normally portrayed in the popular media. For instance, Riverdale is a residential neighborhood of mostly detached single family homes located on bluffs overlooking the Hudson River. It looks more like a quiet suburb than the "big bad" Bronx. Bronx Park and Van Cortlandt Park are two large and notably tranquil green spaces. City Island, located in Long Island Sound but officially part of the Bronx reminds people more of a small New England fishing village and is worth a visit. And there is a traditional downtown area called "The Hub" at 149 St. and Third Avenue. While not as large or extensive as the downtowns of major American cities, many larger stores are in that area and it is more than just a neighborhood shopping district.  Geographically, the Bronx has a large number of hills. It is possible to stand on a street corner and look way down over a cliff toward the elevated train line that is itself 30 feet above ground. Many streets, especially in the West Bronx north of Yankee Stadium, have sections with steps instead of sidewalks and pavement, similar to San Francisco.  In time, The Bronx changed the spelling of its name, and flourished into an area with a vibrant and diverse culture.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Eastern Shore was largely isolated from the rest of Maryland until the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952. As a result, values tend to be conservative and closely related to Virginia, with which it shares a border, as opposed to the western portion of Maryland, which is perceived by locals as more liberal. For this reason, many residents take offense being compared to Marylanders from across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. This sense of alienation from the rest of Maryland has spurred several attempts to split off from the state of Maryland. Proposals have been debated in the Maryland General Assembly in 1833-1835, 1852 and recently in 1998 for the Eastern Shore becoming its own state. Because of its unique location, Marylands different regions portray different regional characteristics.  For tourists coming from the  South , be aware that many, if not most, residents of the Eastern Shore consider themselves Southerners. Maryland was a border state during the Civil War. By 1860 49.1% of the African Americans in the state were free. Some may jump to the conclusion that Shoremen are racist because they consider themselves southerners and live in an isolated area. This is not true and is generally not true for any other southern country area either.</field>

		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Sometimes considered a suburb of Detroit, Flint is more accurately described as a "satellite" city.  Like  Saginaw ,  Pontiac , and other factory towns in Michigan, Flints identity is often influenced and predicted by the Motor City and the peaks and valleys of the American auto industry.  Because these cities, and debatably Flint most of all, have become symbols of urban blight and economic ruin, it is tempting to write them off at the worst as ghost-towns, or at the best as smaller clones of Detroit.  In fact, each city is regionally distinct, both in terms of the local institutions they have raised in times of prosperity and crisis, and in the emphasis of civic response.    In Flints case, for example, the imprint of Charles Stewart Mott, General Motors most famous philanthropist, often overshadows that of Billy Durant, who actually founded the corporation.  Streets, parks, estates, neighborhoods, colleges, and lakes have been named after Mott and his family, and the Mott Foundation funds and supports many cultural events here.  But this reverence toward a more glorious past is just as often tempered by frustration with its side-effects and outcome.  The bulk of Sloan Museum (see below), for example, is a measured analysis of the opportunities and hazards of rapid industrialization.  Much recent literature to come out of Flint, such as Rhonda Sanders Bronze Pillars focuses on the vitality of the African-American community, and its struggle against housing compacts and discrimination in the factories.  It is true that many other communities have struggled with these very issues in recent decades, but the height from which Flint has fallen -- from Michigans "second city" and acknowledged birthplace of the worlds largest corporation to an international symbol of crime and poverty -- has left deep scars on Flintites (or Flintstones; another heady debate in these parts).  Understanding Flint requires understanding that its situation is more complex than that presented by the media, whether this is the General Motors filmstrips of the 1950s, or the Michael Moore film.  This means that there is more to the place than vacant lots and shuttered factories: The Flint Institute of Arts and annual jazz festival are comparable with cities many times this size, and a lively regional music scene is rooted in such venues as the Machine Shop and the Local 432.  One should be aware, however, that any visit is likely to become a referendum on the successes and failures of the American Dream.  There is a lot to see and do in Flint, but much of this may be of a sobering and thoughtful effect; certainly a far cry from the dunes of Lake Michigan or Ann Arbors boutiques.  Flintstones (or Flintites) will be open and generous in pointing you to the best bars, restaurants, museums, and parks; they will also give you their own candid thoughts on the plight of their city.</field>

Mesa is one of the United States fastest-growing cities, and currently ranks as the 37th-largest. 2006 Census Bureau estimates put the citys population at 460,155.  The city has a larger population than better-known United States cities such as Cleveland, Miami, Minneapolis, Saint Louis, or Saint Paul.  Although it has a large population, Mesa is a "bedroom community."

In the last ten years or so, downtown area has experienced a major resurgence, with gourmet restaurants, shopping and attractions.   Town Point Park is a waterfront park area right downtown that hosts several festivals and events throughout the year. A new cruise terminal was just built in 2007 making Norfolk one of the top cruise ports in the country.  Granby Street is the main downtown thoroughfare, lined with restaurants and bars.  Ghent is a historic district adjacent to downtown. Filled with historic homes, tree-lined streets and beautiful old churches, it is a good mix of residential and business. Colley Avenue and 21st Street are the main shopping and dining areas, with dozens of locally-owned boutiques, shops, antique stores, restaurants and bars. The Naro theater on Colley Avenue is the regions sole movie theater with indie flicks.   Ocean View is Norfolks beach community, and features relatively uncrowded beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. During the 50s and 60s, Ocean View was in its prime and was a major beach destination for families and sailors. During the following decades, the beach community fell into a bit of a slump, succumbing to crime. The last five years, the city has been turning things around and now Ocean View is on its way to becoming one of the regions most sought after neighborhoods.</field>

		<field name="content">Soap Lake was officially incorporated on June 9, 1919. The choosing of the town’s name ended the battle between two rival factions. One group had platted a town site and called it Siloam in 1905; while another faction named their town-to-be Cottage City on 1908. The name Soap Lake came from the word Smokiam, an Indian term which translates to “Healing Waters.” The tribes used the lake for healing purposes for themselves and their animals for many years before the area was settled by pioneers. At that time, Soap Lake was already a busy resort and health spa. It contained four hotels and many rooming houses and businesses catering to sojourners seeking a cure. The residents were very proud of the two-room schoolhouse built in 1907. Even though Soap Lake’s main industry was derived from the medicinal lake, it became a social center. In its heyday celebrations, socials, and gatherings where held continuously. Especially well known were the open-air dances, which would draw participants from miles around.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Durham owes much of its wealth and history to tobacco.  Through the second half of the 19th Century, Washington Duke and his family grew from a single farm into American Tobacco, which controlled 90% of all cigarette production for the United States.  The Duke family donated money to Trinity College, which in 1924 was renamed Duke University.  In the early 20th Century, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Mechanics Farmers Bank, and Mutual Savings Loan were founded in Durham by African-Americans.  These prominent companies drew more African-American investment to Durham, to the point that Durhams Parrish Street neighborhood became known as "Black Wall Street."  NC Mutual Life continues to this day as the oldest and largest African-American-owned life insurance company in the nation and as a visible part of the Durham skyline.  The last cigarette rolled out of Durham in 2000.  Many of the old factory and warehouse structures have been converted into housing, retail, restaurant and office spaces.  The city has changed its motto from "City of Tobacco" to "City of Medicine," based on the high concentration of medical practitioners and researchers at Duke and in Research Triangle Park, the Durham County special tax district formed in 1959 to attract high-tech jobs to the area.  Durham has a liberal trendy arts culture.  It is an eclectic blend of the high class with an unusual concentration of four star restaurants (part owing to a strange bit of local family history) to trendy cafés on 9th Street, the independent bookstore "the Regulator" which draws famed authors from former secretary of state Madeline Albright to expert on everything John Hodgeman.  Youll find old hippies, bikers and families in generally happy co-existence.  The area has a very active gay community which stages both a famed regional film festival and an annual pride march. Politically the area is dominated by Democratic politics in an otherwise Republican leaning state.</field>

If possible, do not connect using JFK, especially when switching terminals. If you must connect via JFK, make sure you have sufficient time. For flights from domestic (US and Canada) to JFK to domestic, 2–3 hours. For domestic to JFK to international, 3–4 hours. For international to JFK to domestic, 3–5 hours. For international to JFK to international, 3–6 hours. International travelers are most strongly advised to avoid connecting in JFK to other international flights, as the security and immigration procedures for non-US citizens are monumentally time-consuming and tiresome.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Asbury Park was founded as a Christian retreat in the 1800s by a man named James A. Bradley. It remained one of the most popular family resorts in the United States until 1970, when race riots burned down much of the downtown area.  Soon radicals, beatniks, hippies, and musicians moved in, making Asbury Park a very diverse place. In 1988, the city had had about enough of its new cultures, and a plan to redevelop the entire waterfront went into affect. Most businesses were ordered to be closed, so the boardwalk, casino, hotels and amusements all closed for the redevelopment. High rise hotels and condos began construction, but were then abandoned before they could be finished, leaving the waterfront an odd mix of abandoned buildings and rotting construction.  The city declined in the 1990s, after almost all businesses failed. Crime rose, and Asbury Park had higher crime than any other town in Monmouth County.  However, in 1998, Shep Pettibone converted an abandoned Hotel into a gay nightclub, drawing thousands of gay travelers to Asbury Park. Every Friday night the city became the only place on the East Coast that could rival Fire Island! Gay couples and artists began buying cheap homes, abandoned bars and nightclubs, closed storefronts downtown, and abandoned pavilions on the boardwalk, and restoring them to they way they once were.   Today, Asbury Park is popular amongst even mainstream tourists for its shopping, beaches and restaurants. Major summertime events hosted in Asbury Park include; the Wave Gathering, the Gay Pride Parade, Garden State Film Festival, Asbury Park Jazz Festival, "Road Trip", and the Tri-City Arts Tour.   Asbury Park was recently rated 5 in the top ten beaches of NJ.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Oxford is the home of the University of Mississippi, affectionately known as "Ole Miss," and is in Lafayette County.  It also served as the inspiration for Nobel Prize winner William Faulkners fictional Jefferson (Lafayette County being Yoknapatawpha), the locale of many of his novels.  Oxonians and University members like to describe the town with the motto "We may not win every game, but we never lose a party."  Locals also, "partially" jokingly, refer to the Square as the "Center of the Universe."  Many residents see Oxford as a small town  New Orleans , calling it the "Little Easy."  It is widely known throughout the South for its Southern charm, Old South feel, party atmosphere, and its beautiful women, whom even Hugh Hefner called the finest in the world.  Oxford is also considered a literary center with many writers calling it home.  Also being home to the Ole Miss School of Law and a federal courthouse, it is often said that everyone in Oxford is a "lawyer, writer, or both."  As if to prove this point, famous author John Grisham still owns a house in Oxford and visits frequently.  The Square is the center of downtown and is the main location for the towns best restaurants, shops, bars, and scenery (of the Old South architecture and gorgeous Southern belles).  Chain restaurants, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, and other national retailers are located on the fringes of town.  However, most locals are staunchly anti-chain.  They actively protested the arrival of Applebees and the Wal-Mart Supercenter, even voting out the old mayor because she did not do more to stop it.  Therefore, to truly enjoy Oxford, you must visit the Square and eat and shop at locally-owned establishments.  Otherwise, you are wasting your time visiting and are missing out if you only come for a football game.  Immerse yourself in the town to see why Readers Digest proclaimed, "If Oxford didnt exist, it would have to be invented."  As National Geographic Traveler wrote, "Sophisticated little Oxford is waiting for you."</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">From a tourists point of view, Long Island is most ideal to visit in the summer and the fall when the scenery can be most appreciated. Long Island is great place to visit whether it be for a family vacation, a group of 20-somethings looking to rent a summer house, or an older retired couple looking to enjoy some natural sight-seeing or tour a museum.   Nassau County and Western Suffolk County is very developed and densely populated, and is home more to the suburbia type neighborhoods Long Island became famous for after World War II, where most year-round residents live. (i.e.  Levittown ,  Oceanside ). Central and Eastern Suffolk County, however, is somewhat rural (for the New York area, anyway) and is home to much agriculture, wineries, and beach towns. Many summer homes and hotels are located here, and is where most wealthy New Yorkers congregate in the summer months when the concrete jungle is too hot to bear. Tourist attractions can be found equally in both counties and throughout the entire Island.  Long Islands only downside to tourism is harsh north-eastern winters that make traveling somewhat difficult, and the fact that it is an expensive place to both live as a permanent resident and also as a tourist. There are towns that are more friendly to the wallet than the notoriously expensive Hamptons, or "Gold Coast" North Shore towns, however, Long Island is home to some of the most expensive zip codes in the entire world. Do not expect a bargain vacation when traveling to Long Island, or anywhere in the New York Metropolitan area for that matter.</field>

Some terminals have been renovated recently and look relatively modern, while others are definitely showing their age.  Most were built before the Transportation Security Administration implemented modern security checkpoints, which means the checkpoints were shoehorned into the existing buildings with very awkward results.   If you find yourself in one of the older terminals, keep in mind that the last comprehensive renovation and expansion of LAX was just prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics. Since then, implementation of LAXs current master plan has been stalled for years by lawsuits filed by the airports enraged neighbors.</field>

		<field name="content">To understand Norristown is to understand its residents. Many people have a misconception or false stereotype about Norristown and its people, yet none of these ideas are true. Because it is a suburb of Philadelphia many outsiders assume that it is a rural area occupied by suburban neighborhoods. But because the diverse ethnic population has always been larger than that of surrounding townships (Methacton, East Norriton, Upper Merion, etc.), many people mistake the town for a "ghetto" where "other" races reside. This concept is supposedly reflected in the learning ability of the students and job opportunities for the residents, because all are working class.  Norristown is a center for emerging diverse cultures and ethnic backgrounds. The students of the schools in the Norristown Area School District are above average, with over half ranging from proficient to advanced in math and reading assessments. The crime level is very low and although I would not suggest keeping your door unlocked at night, it is a safe community in which to raise a family. The town is very family-oriented and is mostly residential, with several business districts scattered throughout, particularly on Main Street between Swede and Markley Streets and on Marshall Street west of Markley Street. Main Street is the central east-west corridor in town, and Markley is the main north-south route.  Norristown hosts major annual celebrations such as Community Day and the Food Family and Fun Festival. A farmers market operates on Main Street near the County Court House, currently on Thursday afternoons in the summer.</field>

		<field name="content">The name Socorro is Spanish for "succor" or "aid," which is what 18th- and 19th-century looked for as they travelled south through the desert between  Mexico  and  Santa Fe . During the late 19th century Socorro was the largest town in what is now New Mexico, as the result of an intense but short-lived mining boom.  The bubble burst by the early 1900s, and today Socorro is a smallish town of about 9000 people, dominated by the  New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology  (a legacy of its mining days and now a well-regarded technical college) and the  National Radio Astronomy Observatory .  Socorro is in a geologically interesting area, as its mining past might suggest.  Scruffy mountains (one decorated with a large "M" denoting the college, formerly the New Mexico School of Mines) rise to the west, while the Rio Grande east of town flows through a major continental rift and has created a number of wetlands -- bosques -- that attract wildlife in this dry region.  More ominously, a body of volcanic magma is intruding into near-surface crust not far north of town, creating an uplift that scientists at New Mexico Tech delight in studying.  Even though the region has been the site of considerable volcanism in geologically recent times, not to worry; this uplift is not viewed as posing imminent volcanic hazard -- yet.</field>

Galveston is home to East Beach which is known for being a "party beach". Many famous artists perform occasionally and special events take place. People looking for a good time crowd East Beach.

Volleyball tournaments and sandcastle competitions take place on Stewart Beach. Apart from sunbathing and clubbing, Galveston is also home to a wide range of shopping.

In the summer, the islands population explodes to nearly ten thousand at any given time, and many thousands more on busy weekends or holidays.  Now, many people cant strike a balance between "Block Island the quiet hamlet" and "Block Island the wild tourist destination", and quite often their vacations suffer for this.  I see too many families getting off the ferry, streaming over to Ballards for Bud Lite, crab cakes, and three hours in the sand, and then streaming back onto the ferry, perhaps never knowing how much more the island truly has to offer.  The real Block Island experience should be a perfect synthesis of lazing on the beach, exploring the town of New Shoreham and some of the incredible natural vistas the island has to offer, and indulging in good food and drink at the best of Block Islands restaurants.  As long as you are respectful and manage not to be completely obnoxious, the locals will respond in kind and you will no doubt have an extremely pleasant stay.</field>

Much of the growth of the region can be linked directly to Chicago and its history.  Following the conclusion of the Second World War, Chicagoland simply exploded. New model suburbs such as  Park Forest  gave returning veterans the new amenities of inexpensive housing away from the City.  They settled, raised families and saw a cycle of growth continue. Population started shifting into these new suburbs, which continued to grow and incorporate. Today, the City of Chicago has 2.7 million people while the entire area has 9.7 million (just the Illinois portion). Whereas once the City also held all the attractions, now there are hundreds of unique sites, restaurants and festivals throughout the entire area.</field>

The Save Mart Center at California State University, Fresno ("Fresno State") has also played host to concerts featuring high-profile acts.  Winter weather typically features highs around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and "extreme" lows in the low to mid 30s, often with morning fog and sometimes frost. Rain fall is sparse and occurs exclusively in winter and early spring months. Most rain storms last less than 2 days and are often spread weeks apart. It is not uncommon to experience hail, however it is very rare to see snow fall on the valley floor. The few times it does snow, the snow rarely sticks over night. While winter temperatures can reach below freezing, most all storms feature "warm fronts" that more or less eliminate the chance for snow (mid to low 40s is a typical "cold" rain storm).  Summer temperatures average in the mid-90s. Days with high temperatures 110 degrees or above are not uncommon. Humidity is only around 20% in the afternoon, though, making for a more bearable dry heat. The chance to find 110+ degree days commonly occurs beginning late July and continuing to mid August. During these days the low nighttime temperature will only get down to the mid 80s. It is common for a heat wave to last two weeks.  Fresnos most famous son is the writer William Saroyan, after whom is named a local theater. The city has a large Hmong community.</field>

At one time it was called the worlds protein basket because it produced so much seafood in the form of fish and shellfish, in particular its most famous product, Blue Crabs. Today the bay is a poster child for what happens from overfishing and pollution, but Maryland leads the country in many progressive "Save the Bay" programs to save wetlands, and halt the flow of pollutants from the more than 12 million people who live in its watershed from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The Chesapeake Bay is a magnet for sailing and fishing sports activities.  The state is bounded to the south by the Potomac River, which offers opportunities for boating, and bicycling along the disused Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Trail, leading from  Washington, D.C.  to  Cumberland .    The western part of the state is much more mountainous than the eastern lowlands, and offers hiking along the  Appalachian Trail , whitewater recreation in the Youghiogheny River, and historical sites such as Antietam Battlefield, where the events of the bloodiest single day in American history unfolded.   Ocean City  offers an economy that caters to the huge seasonal influx of beach-goers. It has an odd charm in the winter, with discounted hotels, deserted beaches and empty restaurants.</field>

It is believe by archeologists that an ancient people had migrated to the Wenatchee area during the last ice, some 12,000 years ago. This belief is based on many Clovis artifacts that have been found in or around the greater Wenatchee. These ancient people are thought to be the descendants of whom would later become known as the Yakima Indians. White settlers began to move into the area during the late 1800’s and early 1900’s and colonization began.  The Wenatchee Valley provides an ideal climate for agricultural, and therefore, the area has become widely known for its produce. There are a plethora of orchards in the valley, especially Apple orchards, from which Wenatchee has earned the slogan “Apple Capital of the World.”  In recent years, the city has seen substantial growth within its communities. The greater Wenatchee area incorporates East Wenatchee, which lies on the opposite side of the Columbia River, as well as Rock Island and Malaga. The greater area has a population estimated at over 100,000 residents. It is a popular destination for outdoor adventurers and enthusiasts looking to find a refreshing getaway from their every day surroundings.</field>

The Chippewa spotted a dog that roamed the area.  They referred to the area as the place where the dog, or "Anamoose", lived.  Steel Lake, immediately south of Anamoose, is a prime example of an  ice thrust  depression formed by glaciers about 12,000 years ago.</field>

It is bordered on the west by vast wetlands which drain into the St. Johns River and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.  An important distinction between areas in Brevard County is the mainland and "beachside" on the barrier island facing the Atlantic Ocean. On the north end of the county, Merritt Island falls in between the mainland and beachside, bordered on the west by the Indian River Lagoon and on the east by the Banana River Lagoon. (These two rivers are actually lagoons off the Atlantic Ocean and contain brackish water, a mixture of fresh and salt water.)</field>

It is from this "red stick" that Iberville christened our city "le Baton Rouge", French for "red stick".    The small town here was selected as the new capital of state of Louisiana in 1817, and its been growing since.  The capital was returned to  New Orleans  for a while during and after the troubles of the American Civil War, but its been back here since 1882.</field>

The area dates to about the mid-nineteenth century, as Urbana was founded in 1833, Champaign in 1855 and the University in 1867. Starting out as a farming community, the area matured into two cities with influences at various times through the years including the Illinois Central railroad, the University, now-defunct  Chanute Air Force Base  in nearby  Rantoul  and others. Today, the cities can be described as growing, cosmopolitan and ethnically diverse, with a modern urban feel in the areas core.  Today Champaign-Urbana is defined by some amount of traditional industry such as Kraft Foods, Hobbico, and others, a growing technology and information sector, and the University. The University is the countys largest employer and a very large instituion of 43,000 students. It would be short-changing Champaign-Urbana to call it merely a college town. But there is no doubt that the center of gravity of the arts, entertainment, and intellectual communities rest with the University.  It would be safe to say that Champaign-Urbana is a very open-minded community with regard to social issues, and retains some Midwestern values such as virtue of hard work. Urbana is seen as the more politically liberal and pastoral of the two, and Champaign is seen as having more of a big-city feel. Champaign-Urbana residents are proud of their oasis of culture and big-city amenities amongst the cornfields, of the less intense traffic, sprawl and lower cost of living here compared to major cities, the University of Illinois Fighting Illini sports teams, and its burgeoning arts scene.</field>

		<field name="content">Alabama, along with the South in general, has a reputation for "Southern hospitality." The people of this state are generally genial and helpful and often go out of their way to help a stranger. While racial divisions still exist in the state, they are much more muted than popular belief and stereotypes hold. In fact, many leaps and bounds have been made within Alabama, in terms of race relations, since the 1950s and 60s.  Known primarily for its status as the original capital of the Confederacy (in Montgomery) and the birthplace of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, Alabama can be a study in contrasts.  The sport of American football is taken extremely seriously in Alabama. In addition to significant regional devotion to high-school football teams the entire state, in terms of college football, is divided into two factions: Auburn University fans and University of Alabama fans. The rivalry is so bitter, in fact, that it took an act by the Alabama State Legislature in the late 1940s to force the two colleges to play one another (the two had stopped playing each other in the first years of the 20th century over an officiating dispute).  Even then, the two schools would not agree to play at opposing sites so the State of Alabama used taxpayer funds to build Legion Field in Birmingham as a neutral site. It was only in 1989 that the Crimson Tide finally visited Auburn and 2000 that the Tigers visited Alabama. This can also be a point of concern for tourists as the rivalry is so serious that if you do not know about it then it is better to not say anything at all.  Many friendships and marriages fall apart due to this rivalry and this is not an exaggeration. One could say that Auburn and Alabama fans are rivaled in their fanaticism only by those fans of European football (soccer).</field>

		<field name="content">In the 1840s, the Swiss Glarus Canton, faced with a shortage of supplies, officially sponsored a program to encourage emigration to the United States.  Two agents were dispatched with the task of finding suitable land.  After a review of land in  Indiana  and  Illinois , the agents settled on land in Green County, which had reminded them of Switzerland.  The first immigrants arrived in 1845 and were followed by more immigrants in the following years.  This original Swiss immigration and later influx contributed to many of the unique architecture and local cultural characteristics in the area.  Both New Glarus and Monroe have old world architecture in their downtown areas, and many local traditions include yodeling and a Swiss game called jass.  Green County is also renown in the greater southern Wisconsin area for its annual Cheese Days celebration.  The event originated in in 1914 when, according to the celebrations website, "...the notion that if some little town in Illinois could have a festival commemorating sauerkraut, then  founders thought  a celebration based on cheese would be an even better idea."  The annual celebration is held each year in Monroe.</field>

		<field name="content">Yardley was founded by William Yardley, who immigrated to America in July, 1682 with his family. He made an agreement with William Penn, before leaving England, to buy 500 acres for ten pounds. A survey was completed in October 1682, and the area William Yardley settled was called "Prospect Farm." It was located just outside of the present Yardley Borough. William Yardley died in 1693, and his family in 1702-1703, possibly of smallpox.  A nephew, Thomas Yardley, came to America in 1704 to settle the estate and never returned to England. He opened a ferry line which started operating in 1710 from Letchworth Avenue, the lower boundary of the village, and landed in New Jersey further downstream. This was an important link between West Jersey and the three roads leading to Philadelphia by way of Falls, Langhorne and Newtown. The Yardley family occupied the land for more than 150 years.  When Yardley was founded there were already small settlements at nearby Burlington, Bristol, and Falls Ferry.  Yardley began to develop into a village about 1807, and by 1880 had a population of 820. Early industries included a spoke and handle factory, sawmill, felloe factory, plate and plaster mill, and two flour mills. The first post office, established in 1828, used the name "Yardleyville." The name became "Yardley" again at the time the Reading Railroad came through the area in 1876.  During the American Civil War, Yardley was a station for the  Underground Railroad , an escape route for slaves. Known hiding places were under the eaves of the Continental Hotel (now the Continental Tavern), in bins of warehouses on the Delaware Canal (completed in 1862), and at the General Store (now Worthington Insurance). At Lakeside, the yellow house facing Lake Afton on N. Main St., one brick-walled cellar room is also thought to have been a hiding place.  Yardley Borough was incorporated on March 4, 1895.  The Train Collectors Association, which now boasts worldwide membership of 30,000 individuals, was founded in Yardley in 1954.</field>

		<field name="title">Chicago/Wicker Park</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Boring Store, Wicker Park   Among the most pointless topics of debate in Chicago life is whether Wicker Park has changed, is full of yuppies now, isnt what it used to be, etc. The answers are simple: yes, maybe, and who cares? Just like the Velvet Underground would have been playing stadiums if everybody who claimed to have seen them in 1967 actually did, if everybody who claims to have been there when Wicker Park was cool actually was there, it would be a city roughly the size of  Cleveland . Wicker Park is uniquely well-served by transportation among West Side neighborhoods, with the CTAs Blue Line elevated train and the major arteries of North, Milwaukee, and Damen all converging upon the center of the area.  Wicker Park was founded by the Wicker brothers in the 1870s, and it became part of the row of prosperous immigrant neighborhoods on the West Side of Chicago — the German and Polish beer barons of Wicker Park were neighbored by the farmers of  Bucktown , the Ukrainians in their titular Village, the Greeks and Italians of the  Near West Side , and the Czechs of  Pilsen . The brewery fortunes left two legacies that survive today: gorgeous, European-style mansions and apartment buildings, and a truly world-class set of dive bars. By 1900, Wicker Park had become Chicagos Polish Downtown. The citys oldest and most prominent Polish settlement, Polish Downtown was the political, cultural, and social capital of not only Poles in Chicago but for Polish Americans throughout North America. The area around Polonia Triangle at the intersection of Division, Ashland and Milwaukee Avenue played host to almost every major Polish organization in the United States.   After the economic decline of the West Side, Puerto Ricans became the majority population in Wicker Park. With them came the other two elements that would turn the neighborhoods commercial fortunes around: low rents in those great buildings, and an art scene that became known for exciting new work. Artists and musicians from outside the area moved in, finding cheap studios in places like the Flatiron Arts Building and good venues to exhibit and perform like the Double Door and the excellent Empty Bottle. Among many others, the Smashing Pumpkins were formed in the area, and Liz Phairs album Exile in Guyville re-cast the Rolling Stones Main Street in Wicker Park; on the visual arts side, the long-running Around the Coyote festival continues as an annual gathering of the neighborhoods artistic highlights. (Years later, the John Cusack film High Fidelity attempted to capture Wicker Park in all of its elitist, obnoxious, trend-setting glory, and was generally well received. However, when MTVs The Real World arrived in 2001, it sparked off a memorable neighborhood-wide fit.)  Of course, all vinyl pants must split in the end, and by the mid-90s, real estate prices were on the rise, and bar stools were colonized by conversations about who had been priced out (the Puerto Rican artists, for one) and where the next hot scene would be (opinions vary). Demand for housing in proximity to Wicker Park turned its neighbors Bucktown and Ukrainian Village into hot residential properties, and the boundaries between neighborhoods have become less meaningful with time. There are still a few Ukrainians in whats affectionately known as The Uke, but there are only a few places where their paths cross with the condo conversion kids: aside from the sidewalks in front of the astonishing churches in the area and in line at the terrific old bakeries, all style becomes equal at the historic Division Street Bath House.  Today, a few national chains have settled in among the independent fashion boutiques in Wicker Park, but it still raises a righteous middle finger to the glossy shopping on the  Magnificent Mile , still offers the best places to get a cheap beer, and still has residents who, per capita, care more about quality music and restaurants than anywhere else in the city.</field>

		<field name="title">Deadwood</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">In 1874, famed Army commander George Custer led an expedition into the area and announced that he and his men had discovered gold nearby, in what is today Custer,  South Dakota .  Two years later brothers Charlie and Steve Utter led a wagon train into Deadwood containing essential business supplies - prostitutes and cards - which led to a boost in industries such as booze, gambling parlors, and brothels.  During this time notorious gunfighter "Wild Bill" Hickok helped the Utter brothers by scouting out any troubles the train might encounter.  That same year "Wild Bill" was shot in the head while playing poker at the Saloon No. 10. His killer, "the coward Jack McCall", was captured, tried by a group of miners, freed, re-captured, re-tried by a court, and hanged. Legal proceedings have, thankfully, grown somewhat more standardized in the years since that famous crime.  Historical marker, Deadwood  Another legendary event was the Horsemeat March of 1876 where General Cook led an expedition pursuing a band of Sioux natives fleeing the site of Custers last stand, the Battle of Little Big Horn.  General Cook and his men set off in pursuit with reduced rations in order to give a quicker chase, but they did not predict that the Sioux would burn the grass behind them.  As a result, both the horses and the men had no food and the men eventually were forced to shoot their own horses for food.  Two major fires struck the town in the late 19th century. In 1879, nearly the entire town burned to the ground, including the popular brothel known as the Gem Theater. The owner, Al Swearengen, rebuilt the Gem bigger and more extravagantly than its predecessor. The town lost many of its residents, itinerant miners whose only possessions were destroyed in the fire, but Deadwood eventually recovered. Swearengens command of vice led him into conflict with Sheriff Seth Bullock, a stern Western lawman and another of the towns earliest residents. The town began to flourish again, but was devastated once more by fire in 1894. Sheriff Seth Bullock and some of the other residents stayed and rebuilt even stronger than before, but this time, Swearengen left town. He was last seen as a penniless drunk, killed while trying to catch a train to Colorado.  The towns storied history was the inspiration for the HBO hit TV series Deadwood, which centered around Bullock, Swearengen, and the struggles of Deadwood to rise from a lawless miners camp to a community and a civilization. The show incorporates many of the towns early residents and events including the depiction of a man who survived for half-an-hour after being shot in the head by a prostitute.  In 1989, Deadwood legalized gambling, making it the third place in the United States to legalize gambling after  Atlantic City  and the state of  Nevada , albeit at more limited stakes than its predecessors.  Keep in mind that despite its high aspirations, Deadwood is still a very small town (fewer than 2000 people) in a sparsely populated area.</field>

		<field name="title">Sangre de Cristo Mountains</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Sangre de Cristos are generally considered the southernmost range of the  Rocky Mountains , although some authorities consider the Rockies to include some of the lesser ranges of New Mexico (Sandias, Capitans, etc.).  They rise nearly 8000 feet (2400 meters) above the Great Plains to the east and the Española Valley to the west, with a nearly uninterrupted ridge line that runs from the Colorado state line to near Santa Fe.  This topographical barrier had important impacts on the settling of the  Southwest  by "Anglos" arriving from the eastern United States, as it forced pioneers southward and thus into contact -- and sometimes conflict -- with both American Indian communities along the Rio Grande and Spanish colonial settlements at Santa Fe,  Albuquerque  and other places.  The mixing, and sometimes clash, of the three cultures continues to exert an influence on the region long after the settlers passed.  The highest summit in the Sangres in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, elevation 13,161, a comparatively undistinguished bump on a ridge line above Taos.  (Summits in the extension of the range into  Colorado  exceed 14,000 in elevation.)  Several other summits rise above the 13,000 level.  Timberline in these mountains is unusually high, approaching 12,000 in some places, and there are no permanent snowfields; recreational opportunities in the Sangres are consequently highly diverse and seasonal, so that many fine hiking and backpacking areas in the summer turn into downhill ski resorts in the winter.  When planning a trip to the Sangres and deciding in what season to visit, keep the changing seasons in mind.  Towns on the eastern slopes of the Sangres tend to have cultural ties to the Great Plains, while the ones on the west side are more closely tied to the Hispanic and Native American settlements along the Rio Grande.  The latter being important tourist destinations in their own right, the west-side towns usually have somewhat more well-developed resources for tourism than the ones on the east.  However, a unifying feature of the high mountain towns is that, apart from the ones intentionally developed for tourism, they tend to be relatively poor, whether on the east or the west.  This results from the difficulty in extracting a living from the mountains: their height and resulting short growing season preclude most agriculture, and most of the range is of little interest for mining.  Tourist accommodations outside the major tourist centers (Taos, Santa Fe, ski resorts) or towns on major roads (Las Vegas) can therefore be somewhat spartan, at least by United States standards, although you dont have to worry about potable water, utilities, etc.  (The rugged terrain does produce spotty coverage for cellular phones.)</field>

		<field name="content">An early settler named Michael King came to the area in 1878. He moved in along with 10 oxen and 10 men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. Mr. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, the trees were gone and King moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as Kings Town, probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved in to Kingston and stuck.  The Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890 by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it The Monterey of Washington. Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, along with a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed and it eventually became the quaint harbor town we know today.</field>

The body of water separating Whidbey Island and Camano Island is called Saratoga Passage.  Camano Island is named for the Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño. Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838-1842, named it MacDonough Island in honor of Thomas MacDonough for his victory of the Battle of Lake Champlain during the War of 1812. Following this theme, Wilkes named the body of water between Camano and Whidbey Island after MacDonoughs flagship the Saratoga. When Henry Kellett reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847, he removed Wilkes name MacDonough and bestowed the name Camano, which the Spanish had originally given to Admiralty Inlet in 1790. Wilkes name Saratoga Passage was retained.</field>

As a shipping and milling town, Duluth once had the highest number of millionaires per capita in the United States. This is still reflected in the large number of mansions in the east end of town. Ocean-going vessels come up the St. Lawrence Seaway into the Great Lakes to Duluth Harbor. Since these "salties" go through the locks, they are smaller than the native "lakers" that stay within the Great Lakes. Ships under many flags, including Nigeria, Greece, and Denmark frequently dock in Duluth to pick up grain and coal for overseas markets. Iron-ore and taconite still go to Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania for processing into steel.  Built largely on a 700-foot hill overlooking Lake Superior, Duluth also has a thriving tourism industry, with antique shops, excellent restaurants, cozy inns, and scenic views of the lake. There is a ski resort inside city limits. Canal Park and Superior Street have the highest concentrations of tourist destinations in the city. The famous Aerial Lift Bridge is on Lake Avenue, next to Canal Park. Particularly proud residents liken the city to  San Francisco , which also has bridges, hills, a bay, and a thriving tourist business. The renowned Grandmas Marathon is held annually, named after Grandmas Saloon (restaurant) in Canal Park. The University of Minnesota-Duluth and St. Scholastica College are the two largest colleges in the city with over 12,000 students together.  Duluth is the western endpoint of the scenic North Shore Drive, which follows the rugged north coast of Lake Superior nearly 700 miles to  Sault Ste Marie (Ontario) .

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Sitting on the border of the United States and Canada, the North Cascades National Park covers an area of over 500,000 acres and ranges between 1,000 to over 10,000 vertical feet. Much of the park is designated as "wilderness," and there are few areas with developed facilities. It is quite close to  Bellingham  and  Seattle , however, providing easy access from urban areas. The park is divided into two non-contiguous sections to the north and south of the North Cascades Highway (State Route 20).   Non-hikers are limited to the view from the highway, and a few side roads. See the  itinerary  for details.</field>

		<field name="title">Chicago/Far Northwest Side</field>
		<field name="main">understand</field>
		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The Far Northwest Side is, for many travelers, nothing more than a blur of drab buildings seen from the expressway or the Blue Line on their way to  OHare . And only the most fervent of true believers could make an argument that it ought to be anywhere near the top of a first-time visitors list. None of the citys most famous landmarks are located here; nothing in the best-known history or literature about Chicago happened here. In fact, most Chicagoans would find the Far Northwest Side as unfamiliar as someone right off a plane from the coast.  What is here, though, is a group of large, residential communities and a handful of treasures theyve grown accustomed to keeping for themselves, unencumbered by style or pace. Sausage shops and old-style Italian restaurants carry on as if health food and celebrity chefs never happened. If youre serious about trying a Chicago-style hot dog at the peak of the form, youll do well here. Two classic movie palaces awaken for special events, and there are strong contenders for the citys best music venue and original theater venue — the Abbey Pub and the Prop Thtr, respectively.   Plenty of tourists and locals have tried "going Chinese" for a night in  Chinatown , but an even more immersive (and less-traveled) experience is "going Polish." English slides to second on the signs, the food makes sweet love to your waist, and the beer flows cheap at your choice of fab discos straight out of Eastern Europe or laid-back dives with you and the regulars. Famously, Chicago has the largest population of Polish people of any city in the world save  Warsaw . If you never make it to  Poland , at least you can say youve been to Avondale.  So once youre sick of the screaming brats in  Lakeview  and  Lincoln Park , the scuzz in  Uptown , the tourist traps on the  Mag Mile , the crowds in the  Loop , the hipsters in  Wicker Park , the confusion in  Rogers Park , the pretension in  Hyde Park , the cranks in  Bridgeport  — and youre in the mood to experience Chicago all over again, for the first time — then the Far Northwest Side may have something for you.</field>

Nearly one century later, a Quaker couple of the names Thomas and Deborah Brooke founded both the town of Brookeville and the village of Olney (named after the hometown Ms. Brookes favorite English poet, William Cowper). During the first half of the nineteenth century, Sandy Spring in particular was an important stop on the  Underground Railroad , as the Quakers (the Society of Friends) were devoted abolitionists and early proponents of racial equality in America. Long a sleepy agricultural area, Olney in the second half of the twentieth century outgrew its neighbors by a large margin, becoming an home for affluent D.C. commuters.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">The City of Woodbury, one of the oldest "small cities" in the United States, had its beginning in 1683 when Henry Wood, a Quaker from Bury, England, settled here. See the Bury, England Website History.  By 1715 Woodbury had become a Quaker religious center and was a thriving hamlet at the onset of the American Revolution.  Given its close proximity to Philadelphia, Woodbury had a significant place in the history of the nation’s birth.  The Red Bank Battlefield, where Fort Mercer is located and where, in 1777, six hundred determined American’s defeated a Hessian force of six thousand, lies just two miles west of Woodbury.   The famous British General Lord Cornwallis, who would later surrender to George Washington at  Yorktown , had his headquarters in Woodbury during his advance to capture the City of  Philadelphia  in 1777.  By the mid-nineteenth century Woodbury had grown considerably and was incorporated as a City in 1854. The City of Woodbury enjoyed its greatest economic and population growth between 1880 and 1900. This was accomplished in large part as a result of the Green family and their patent medicine industry.  Woodbury has been the county seat of  Gloucester  for over two centuries. The County continues to this day to develop its operational base throughout the City of Woodbury. This fact, along with the growth of Underwood Memorial Hospital, has made Woodbury the legal and medical hub of the immediate vicinity.  Recently, Woodbury has also begun to experience a commercial rebirth owing greatly to the efforts of Woodbury Main Street Inc. Having entered the new millennium, the city of Woodbury is poised to play its appropriate part in enhancing history yet to be recorded.</field>

Built right on the southern edge of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Akron really grew by selling gravity. It happens to be right on the shortest possible line drawn between the Cuyahoga River (connecting to the  Great Lakes  - Lake Erie), and the Tuscarawas River (connecting to the Ohio River and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico.) The Portage Path, the shortest path for carrying a canoe from one water shed to the next, has connected the two since time immemorial, and is the primary reason Akron grew just where it did.</field>

The town is far off the road system, 400 air miles west of Anchorage, and all fuel, grocery, household items, building materials, vehicles, etc., must be flown in or shipped in by barge.  Consequently, prices are relatively high, even by Alaskan standards.  It is good to remember, however, that as a hub community, Bethel prices are still less (sometimes by half) than prices even in nearby villages.  The Y-K Delta (as the greater area is called) is home to an active subsistence culture.  Many residents, both Native and Non-Native, fish and hunt for food as well as for sport.</field>

		<field name="content">Topeka, located in Shawnee County, serves as the capital of Kansas. The metropolitan area is rich in history and highly favored by nature. It lies on rich sandy loam river bottomland where Indians lived for many years using the excellent fords on the Kansas (Kaw) River. Among the first permanent settlers were three French-Canadian (Pappan) brothers. They married three Kanza (Kansas) Indian sisters and established a ferry over the river in 1842. A grandson from one of the marriages was Charles Curtis, the only Vice-President of the United States to be of Indian descent. (Charles Curtis served with President Herbert C. Hoover from 1929 to 1933.) In the 1800s, Topeka served as a gateway west for pioneers traveling on the Oregon Trail or by railroad.  Topeka is home to the highly acclaimed Kansas Museum of History where youll step back in time and learn all about the land that is Kansas. Relive the history of Kansas through exhibits, videos, and programs.  Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site overlooks the Oregon Trails ferry site across the Kansas River and includes the original Atchison, Topeka Santa Fe Railroad depot from Pauline as well as a turn of the century town, botanical gardens, and dinners served by hosts in period dress.  Topeka has been an active participant in the modern-day Civil Rights Movement. The Monroe School is the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic site where visitors gain an understanding and appreciation for the role of this decision in the Civil Rights Movement.  Gage Park houses the Topeka Zoo, Renisch Rose Gardens with over 6,500 plants, offering 400 varieties, and a 1908 Carousel that houses a 1909 Wurlitzer organ. Tour the Combat Air Museum, the Capitol Building, and the Governors home - Cedar Crest. First Presbyterian Church, built over 112 years ago, is the site of a unique presentation of Tiffany windows. Louis C. Tiffany came to Topeka in 1911 and produced these windows. First Presbyterian Church is the only church west of the Mississippi River to have all Tiffany windows. Visit Heartland Park, a state-of-the-art motor sports complex. The Topeka area has an abundance of campgrounds and lakes, as well as hiking and biking trails.  The 183,000 square foot Topeka-Shawnee County Public Library may be one of the greatest libraries around, with over 90,000 + card holders. You can see license plates from several counties from Kansas and surrounding states, like Missouri, Arkansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, New Mexico, Minnesota and several other states. The Topeka-Shawnee County Public may be the best cultural asset in the city. Great selections of all media types--books, movies, music, periodicals and others. If you are a classic movie fan, than you will enjoy the Topeka Public Library. I recommend finding old time movie actors and searching them individually for titles, like Robert Mitchum or Jimmy Stewart or James Cagney. Classical music is good, new books are plentiful and the business reference section is one of the best for researching businesses and industries. Great local and state businesses resources are available too. The health section is sponsored by Stormont Vail, where you can test blood pressure and check out bags for various ailments and find any kind of medical information possible. The Topeka Public Library is a must see for anybody visiting the City of Topeka. You wont be disappointed.</field>

Evidence has displayed that the region may have been inhabited as many as 11,000 years ago.  The first modern settler was Abel Platts, who arrived in 1738.  The onset of the French and Indian War in 1744 drove the majority of the initial settlers away, but only for a short time.  Platts and an small group of settlers returned to establish a more permanent residence in 1758 after the war had subsided.  By 1859, there was 1,200 residents living in the small mill town.  Rindge has only grown slightly over the years with modern census figures displaying slightly more than 6,000 current residents.</field>

The current Jasper County Courthouse, built of Carthage stone in 1894, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After the civil war, Carthage thrived as a railroad town, a source for "Carthage marble" (a hard, polished limestone) and a highway crossroads when U.S. Highways 66 and 71 came to town in 1926.</field>

Berkeleys progressive, free-thinking environment has seen the birth of quality attractions, great food from many cultures, and of course the internationally renowned University of California, Berkeley. For a city of just over 100,000 people—barely a medium-sized city in the California context—Berkeley is extremely complex.</field>

Fidalgo Island Burrows Bay and Allen (left) and Burrows Islands (right); Lopez Island (behind)  The island was originally inhabited by the Samish and Swinomish peoples.  Fidalgo Island is named for the Spanish explorer and cartographer Salvador Fidalgo who explored the area in 1790 with the fleet of Francisco de Eliza. Charles Wilkes discovered that it was an island rather than part of the mainland. He named it Perry Island in honor of Oliver Hazard Perry, the American commander who won the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. Following this theme, Wilkes named the islands highest point Mount Erie. When Henry Kellett reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847, he removed Wilkes name Perry and bestowed the name Fidalgo to honor the Spanish explorer. The highest point retained the name Erie.    Settlement peaked in 1850s due to the Fraser River Gold Rush and in 1890 due to speculation that the area would become a terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Later the island became an important fishing and lumber center.</field>

		<field name="content">When the town filed application to be set off from Willsborough in 1797, it was known as Mallory’s Bush for one of its earliest permanent settlers, Nathaniel Mallory. Settlements grew quickly along the river and on the plateaus. Lumber was plentiful, iron was available in the ground, and the soil was “vigorous and fertile”. In 1825, an entire town began to develop in AuSable Forks around the lumber and forging business. Jay has broad fields, and open vistas. The pastoral landscape was first developed as an iron ore processing community. The first image of Jay is often a view of the river running through the landscape. Out of the High Peaks the AuSable River tumbles through Keene, and is joined by numerous streams and freshets as it spreads itself out over the Jay fields. Early annual log drives scoured its bottom and cleared its banks. Now the river becomes wider and shallower each year. The river empties into Lake Champlain at Plattsburgh. The river, which has had its role in the successes and disasters that have struck the town, demolished Jay’s most unusual attraction, The Land of Make Believe. The theme park with miniature houses that illustrated specific professions was situated on a curve in the river in Upper Jay. Floods tore away at the park, three floods in its last year of operation. Opened in 1954, it gave up its fight against the river and closed in 1980. Buildings by Arto Monaco, its talented designer, remain at Storytown and Santa’s Workshop.

		<field name="content">Saint Marys was founded by Bavarian Catholic immigrants in 1842, and today it still retains the early settlers work ethic, industrial nature, and religious devotion.  The original settlers intended to take up farming as their primary industry, but the terrain was found to be unsuitable to widespread agriculture.  Fortunately, there were other resources to which they could turn.  First among these was logging, facilitated by powerful new steam engines, and the corresponding lumbering industry.  Brickmaking was popular for a while, as well as brewing.  Around the turn of the 20th century, carbon and powdered metal became an important part of the boroughs economy.  Saint Marys was also the site of an early light bulb manufacturing company, the Novelty Incandescent Lamp Company; through a series of mergers and name changes that company became Sylvania, which still maintains a major facility in Saint Marys over 100 years later.  In 1992, Saint Marys absorbed the surrounding township of Benzinger and incorporated as a city, leading to the slogan "Pennsylvanias Newest City".  Most of the "city" limits remains wild, with business and residences found primarily within the former borough limits.  Today, powdered metal, carbon, beer, and light bulbs are still the cornerstones of the Saint Marys economy, but like many old industrial areas, the city is shifting toward more service-oriented businesses.</field>

		<field name="content">The Treaty of Paris (1783), concluded between the  United States  and  Great Britain  at the end of the American Revolutionary War, stated that the boundary between U.S. territory and the British possessions to the north would run "…through the Lake of the Woods to the most northwestern most point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi…" The parties did not suspect that the source of the Mississippi, Lake Itasca, was south of that point. Consequently the Northwest Angle is the result of 18th-century ignorance of geography. In the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, the error was corrected by having the boundary run due south from the northwest point of the lake to the 49th parallel and then westward along it. When this north-south line was surveyed, it was found to intersect other bays of the lake and therefore cut off a portion of U.S. territory, now known as the Northwest Angle.   The Angle is one of only four non-island locations in the 48 contiguous states not directly connected to them by land within the country, the others being nearby  Elm Point , Minnesota;  Point Roberts , Washington; and the town of  Alburgh , Vermont. All four are located on the Canadian border with the  United States . The settlement itself is the farthest north in the contiguous United States.</field>

Moline is one of the Quad Cities, along with neighboring East Moline and Rock Island in Illinois and the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa. The corporate headquarters of Deere Company is located in Moline, as is Quad City International Airport, Black Hawk College, and the Quad Cities campus of Western Illinois University. Moline is a retail hub for the Illinois Quad Cities, as Southpark Mall and numerous big-box shopping plazas are located in the city. In the mid-1990s, the city undertook major efforts to revitalize its central business district, which had declined after suburban growth and retail changes after the 1950s and 1960s. Today, Molines downtown again serves as one of the civic and recreational hubs of the Quad Cities; many events take place at the 12,000-seat i wireless Center (formerly known as The MARK of the Quad Cities) and at John Deere Commons.</field>

The Buffalo National River encompasses 135 miles of the 150-mile long river. It begins as a trickle in the Boston Mountains 15 miles above the park boundary. Following what is likely an ancient riverbed, the Buffalo cuts its way through massive limestone bluffs traveling eastward through the  Ozarks  and into the White River. The national river has three designated wilderness areas within its boundaries.  Headquarters is located in  Harrison . The Tyler Bend Visitor Center, the main visitor center for the park, is located 31 miles south of Harrison and 11 miles north of  Marshall  on US Highway 65. The park has two other visitor contact stations: the Pruitt Ranger Station, located five miles north of  Jasper  on Arkansas Highway 7, and Buffalo Point Ranger Station, located 17 miles south of  Yellville  on Arkansas Highway 14.</field>

		<field name="content">A statue of Saint Claire, the citys namesake, stands in Civic Center Park, near city hall. Santa Clara, California is a small city of big contrasts. If any city can claim to be "the center of Silicon Valley," it is this town of just over 100,000. Intel, AMD, WebEx, NVIDIA, and National Semiconductor all have headquarters here. At the same time, Santa Clara is one of the oldest settlements (by Europeans) in Northern California. The Mission Santa Clara de Asís was established in 1777, and the Jesuit-run Santa Clara University, founded in 1851, is the oldest university in California. Dozens of 19th century homes are well-maintained by their 21st century owners in the "old quad," the earliest residential area, adjacent to the university.   Yet another contrast is the diversity of the local population, driven by the tech boom of the 1970s-1990s. Visitors from Asia and Europe frequently overhear strangers speaking their native languages. Specialty markets offer native ingredients from around the world, and the Indian and East Asian restaurants are some of the best in the Bay Area. But many of the best places in Santa Clara are not visible at first glance. You could drive right through this town and see nothing of any interest, or you could take the time to learn where to look, explore, and enjoy.</field>

		<field name="content">South view of the DeKalb County, Georgia, courthouse.  Decatur is the county seat of DeKalb County.  This historic city was founded in 1823 - before neighboring Atlanta. It has beautiful homes, historic  places of worship and several institutions of higher learning.  Centered on the historic Decatur Courthouse, Decatur has become a hot destination for college students and young professionals who want hip bars, great restaurants, and walkable neighborhoods, as well as for families who are drawn to the excellent independent school district. In addition to the single-family homes in old neighborhoods surrounding the central business district, in recent years there have been several mid-rise condominium developments in the downtown area, breathing new life into the downtown community.    While it may appear to be a typical southern city, Decatur marches to the beat of a different drummer. It declined to become a railroad transportation hub for the southeast in the 19th Century, resulting in the founding of Atlanta to its west. Both delegates from DeKalb County voted against secession in 1861.  Decatur is one of the few parts of the sprawling Atlanta area that blends a small-town feel with an open-minded, freewheeling, artsy sensibility.   Decatur remains notable for its diversity.  Founded by Scotch/Irish/English immigrants, the city remains majority Caucasian, but there is also a substantial African-American population, a lesbian community and recent Ethiopian immigrants.  North of the city is a Greek-American community, and northeast of the city (around Church St., Scott Blvd./Lawrenceville Hwy. and DeKalb Industrial Blvd.) is a thriving Indian community with restaurants and retail outlets.   Decatur is also notable for its location.  Atlanta and Decatur are Georgias only county seats inside the "Perimeter" interstate (I-285) that encircles the metro area.  Atlanta is an international city with corporate headquarters, world class convention facilities and a fast pace, while Decatur has retained a small city feel and a slightly slower pace.  Decatur is surrounded by the city of Atlanta on its south and west sides. It is closer to Atlantas business, retail and cultural destinations than many Atlanta neighborhoods, and is easily mistaken for an intown neighborhood of Atlanta.</field>

		<field name="content">Dubuque grew rapidly during the 19th century, due to its lead-mining, lumber-milling, brewing, metal-working, and river-trade-related industries. It was Iowas largest city for most of the 1800s, and as a result contains many historically significant structures, many of which have been carefully maintained or restored.  Much of the citys character was established by heavy German and Irish immigration from the 1840s to the 1890s, with the Germans tending to settle in the "North End" and the Irish in the "South End." Large Catholic parishes associated with each group were established, and large, impressive 19th-century church buildings remain to this day. The large Catholic presence caused Dubuque to be elevated to the status of a Catholic archdiocese in 1893, and it is still the smallest US city to hold this distinction.  Noteworthy church buildings include St. Raphael Cathedral, St. Mary (with its jewel-like Bavarian stained-glass windows), Sacred Heart, Holy Trinity, Holy Ghost, St. Columbkille, and the Basilica of St. Francis in nearby Dyersville. St. Lukes Methodist Church contains a significant collection of Tiffany-designed stained-glass windows in a striking Romanesque Revival structure.  Dubuque, as a small industrial center, saw its economy falter in the 1980s as industries downsized or relocated. The city has made a concerted effort to attract tourists, with the establishment of historic districts, museums, a greyhound racing park, a casino, a riverside hotel and conference center, and a new (2003) Smithsonian-affiliated museum devoted to the history and biology of the Mississippi River. Recently, IBM named Dubuque one of its "Smarter Cities", and is currently in the process of moving 1,500 jobs into the restored Roshek building downtown.</field>

WWII diminished Mt Gretna’s popularity, with the closing its amusement park and the abandonment of its hotels.  Some traditions, however, remained.  The Playhouse Theater, the Jigger Shoppe, the Roller Rink, the Lake all remained.  And of course, the tradition of spending days and nights relaxing on the front porch of its many cabin-like homes.  In 1960 the Timber’s Restaurant was built, and in 1976 the very first annual Gretna Art Show took place, quoted as Mt Gretna modern revival.

		<field name="content">New Jersey is a densely populated state with a diverse population, rich culture, and many assets, including abundant natural resources and Fortune 500 companies.  New Jerseys big cities are centers of government and business. Though parts of the larger cities may be run down, they still have a lot to offer. Atlantic City, Princeton and New Brunswick are great cities and inhabited by the middle to upper class. Most New Jerseyans prefer to live in their suburbs and in nearby small towns. Rich folks cluster in certain old established towns and rural enclaves like  Alpine ,  Harding Township , and  Rumson . More than a third of the state, including the Pine Barrens, is rural and sparsely populated, with little or no public transportation.   There is a strong New York City influence in the north, and Philadelphia influence in the south. All major radio stations and local TV stations that serve New Jersey are located in those cities. New Jersey also serves as a bedroom community for many people who work in New York City and Philadelphia.  If driving in New Jersey, keep in mind that state law does not allow self-service at gas stations.  New Jersey has some of the cheapest gasoline in the country due to its low gas tax, but a gas station attendant must pump the gas. Just pull up to the pump and tell the attendant "(Dollar amount, or "Fill it with"), (grade), (cash/credit), please".  You are legally allowed to pump your own diesel fuel.  However, not all gas stations allow this.  Many truckstops will let you pump diesel.</field>

		<field name="name">understand</field>
		<field name="content">Hyder has a colorful history as wild west mining camp and border town that took advantage of its unique status as an American territory between the Canadian mainland and several Canadian mines that could only be accessed via Hyder. In its heyday Hyder was filled with saloons, ladies of the evening, gambling and all manner of other sin because it was just across the border and therefore out of reach of the Canadian Mounties and a long way from any American law enforcement presence.  The portion of Hyder built over the water and abandoned as mining activity declined burned down in 1948. Today the town is now only about one block long and it and starts right at the unguarded American border. Therefore, Hyder represents an unusual opportunity for travelers to visit  Alaska ,  USA  legally without a US visa.    Canada , however, does guard the border and visitors with inadequate Canadian visas or passports often get temporarily stuck in Hyder until they can get the right immigration documents.  If you are visiting Canada on a single entry visa do not go to Hyder (or elsewhere in Alaska) as you will not be allowed back into Canada without getting a new visa.   As the Easternmost town in Alaska and the closest and most accessible point in Alaska by road to the Lower 48 States, Hyder is a popular place to "collect" Alaska as a travel destination.   Hyder is notable for being the only place in Alaska not to use the 907 area code, instead using  British Columbia s 250 area code. Unlike the rest of Alaska, Hyder unofficially uses the Pacific Time Zone like most of British Columbia and the US West Coast States. The preferred currency is Canadian (except the U.S. Post Office, which insists on American currency). Hyders nearly 100 residents observe Canadian holidays, send their children to a Canadian school, and if they call the police will find that a Canadian Mountie will respond. BC Hydro supplies the electricity from Canada. Hyder and Stewart share a mutual international Chamber of Commerce.</field>

Dont be fooled, though; Chatham and Greater Grand could be the highlight of your trip to Chicago. The best blues clubs, the last true juke joints, are way down here.  Greater Chatham (Chatham, Avalon Park, Calumet Heights, Burnside) is a residential stronghold of middle and upper class African-American Chicagoans. No sightseeing to be done, but Chatham boasts some of the best food on the South Side (including the ultimate Harolds), as well as one of the citys best blues clubs.  Greater Grand rivals Chatham for soul food, BBQ, and blues club supremacy. It also has the Oak Woods Cemetery, which is both beautifully laid out and resting place to some of the most famous residents of the South Sides past.   South Shore is home to a lively arts scene, largely thanks to the ETA Creative Arts Foundation and the magnificent South Shore Cultural Center. It is also home to one of the citys best and least known beaches, Rainbow Beach. Incidentally, many of Chicagos most prominent black politicians call this community home. Its main commercial strip runs alongside Metras Electric Line on 71st St and is literally lined with kids hanging out when schools not in session.</field>
