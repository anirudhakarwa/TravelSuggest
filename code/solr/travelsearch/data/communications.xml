		<field name="content">Cell phone coverage in Mississippi is generally better (especially with Sprints T-Mobiles networks) along the major Interstate routes. Coverage in the southern Mississippi region is sometimes spotty (particularly west of  Hattiesburg ).  4G coverage though growing sporadically throughout the state near the college cities, generally is located in the Jackson metropolitan area; however, outside of the Jackson area, 3G service is typically available with parts of the Delta being the exception.  Check with your cell phone provider for coverage maps.  The regional cell phone provider C Spire Wireless has a large network established throughout Mississippi, and you might be able to roam on their towers if you are not a customer.  Consider purchasing a disposable cell phone from any major electronic department store in Mississippi during your visit.  There are few fee pay telephones available outside of airports or shopping malls.  The cost is about $25 a month is the average price for approximately 100 minutes of talk time without (in other words, its very expensive for what you pay for).    Be aware that pretty much any cell phone from either South Korea or Japan will typically not work anywhere in Mississippi, but some of the older European model cell phones (operating in the 3G UTMS frequencies of 850/1900/2100MHz) should work fine in the state.</field>
