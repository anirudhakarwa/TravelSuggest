		<field name="content">Take the streetcar in if youre in Uptown or Mid City. Driving in on Interstate 10, take the Orleans Avenue or Vieux Carre exit.  Once youre in the Quarter, its best seen on foot. If you do drive within the Quarter, expect it to be SLOW, and watch for the pedestrians and bikes. The Quarter is very doable on a bike, but again be especially alert.  The Quarter is wider (from Canal to Esplanade) than it is deep (from the River to Rampart).  Bourbon and Royal Streets (see below) are the main avenues running through the width of the French Quarter; sections are often closed off to motor vehicles.  Parallel Chartres Street is often a better option for pedestrians actually heading somewhere when Royal and Bourbon are jammed with visitors.  The heart of the Quarter is Jackson Square, listed below.</field>
