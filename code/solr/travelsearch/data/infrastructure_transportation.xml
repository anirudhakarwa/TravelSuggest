		<field name="content">Solebury is located in the township off, U.S. Route 202. Solebury however is not like any other town, the population is very minute so the traveling is not so diverse. There are not many buses that come through. Many people travel by their cars as well as school buses. You are also able to get to Solebury by the Pennsylvania Turnpike but you must get off in Doyelstown. There are no direct trains however to Solebury. This could be a weakness to this tourist attraction, but with its activities to do it is well worth the trip.</field>
