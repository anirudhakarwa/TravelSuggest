		<field name="content">Safety issues often amount to the common sense youd take in most cities. Keep valuables and expensive electronics out of sight and dont go out at night alone. Lock your car and park under well lit areas. Be weary of any fights you see; chances are its a rouse. Also be mindful to cover your card number when withdrawing money from ATMS.

		<field name="content">Chinatown was formerly home to the "combat zone," a term created from all the World War II soldiers visiting the area.  The "combat zone," is now a thing of the past and new  development, like the luxury Archstone apartment building has been built.   Chinatown is perfectly safe, but like any major city neighborhood, you want to practice safety.</field>
