		<field name="content">The easiest way to get around Hollywood and South Florida is by car.  If renting, it is substantially less money to rent a car from a location outside of the airport.  The city is set up on grid system, and is fairly easy to navigate.  Broward County is served by three major Interstates (I-75, I-95, I-595) and some U.S. Highways including  U.S. Highway 1 , US 27 and US 441. It is also served by Floridas Turnpike and State Highway 869, also known as the Sawgrass Expressway.   Fort Lauderdale Airport  is served by all national and regional rental car franchises.</field>

		<field name="name">getting around</field>
		<field name="content">While in the Dalton area you need to become familiar with the Dalton By-Pass.  This is a large 4 lane highway that circles Dalton - it also carries US Highway 41 today so you can look for those signs as well. The By-Pass "as locals call it" runs from I-75 at Exit 328 (known locally as the Connector 3 Exit)to I-75 at Exit 336.  Exit 333 is West Walnut Avenue that begins at the interstate and runs due east and connects with the By Pass approximately in the middle. Using Walnut Avenue and the By-pass are good ways to get in and around the area.</field>
