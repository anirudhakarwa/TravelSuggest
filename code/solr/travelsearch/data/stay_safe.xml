		<field name="content">Due to Arizonas proximity to the International Boundary with  Mexico , visitors should be cautious while in areas near the border.   Know where you are at all times, follow good safety procedures and use common sense when making decisions.  Do not pick-up hitch hikers.  Keep valuables, including spare change, out of sight and lock your vehicle.  Avoid traveling in well-marked but unofficial "trails."  Avoid hiking or camping in areas of major border activity.  If you are visiting a national or state park, consult park staff to help plan backcountry travel in safer areas.  Report any suspicious behavior to the U.S. Border Patrol.</field>

		<field name="name">deserts</field>
		<field name="content">A large portion of Arizonas land area consists of extensive desert landscapes, many of which are very remote and can easily become disorienting to a tourist whom is unfamiliar with these locations. It is not at all uncommon for temperatures in the Arizona desert to reach 115-120 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer months, which have the potential to impose deadly consequences to anyone who should become lost or stranded in these areas.  If are planning on traveling or hiking into these locations, follow desert survival guidelines. Be sure to take plenty of water (at least one gallon per person, per day), sunscreen and wear light clothing. Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to get return.  Also, it is best to hike during the earlier part of the day, as thunderstorms tend to develop suddenly during the afternoon. In the event you encounter inclement weather conditions, seek high ground immediately! Thunderstorms can cause flash flooding in canyons and other low laying areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Dust storms are caused by high winds blowing dust onto highways. Usually brief, dust storms should be taken seriously because they can quickly decrease visibility. If you see a dust storm while driving:   Turn on your headlights and slow to an appropriate speed.  If you can safely avoid it, do not enter the dust storm.  If you need to pull off the road, get as far to the right as possible. Turn off the car, set the parking brake and keep your foot off the brake pedal – other drivers may think you’re a car in motion.</field>

		<field name="name">rain</field>
		<field name="content">Typically during the summer monsoon season, Arizona does experience heavy rainstorms or monsoons.  While these storms are usually brief, the heavy rain can cause flooding in low-lying areas.  If you find yourself driving during one of these storms:   If you need to pull off the road, get as far to the right as possible. Turn off the car, set the parking brake and keep your foot off the brake pedal – other drivers may think you’re a car in motion.  Pay attention to hazard signs and roadblocks. If you see a sign that says "Do Not Cross When Flooded", take it seriously and find another way. Section 28-910 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, commonly known as the "Stupid Motorist Law", states that any motorist who drives around barricades into a flooded stretch of roadway may be charged for the cost of his or her rescue.  Don’t cross rain-swollen washes. You could get caught in a flash flood. That guy out there who seems to be only ankle-deep in water may be standing on the roof of his pickup truck.  Most of these summer monsoon rain storms are accompanied by lightning.  Take proper precautions.</field>

		<field name="content">Summer temperatures in some areas of Arizona nearly can surpass 100 F (38 C) and visitors should take extra precautions while visiting the state.  In Phoenix, record temperatures of 118 F and 116 F (48 47C) have been approached with greater regularity in recent years.  Frequent hydration is extremely important.  If outdoors:   Rest frequently in shady areas so that the bodys temperature has a chance to recover.  If unaccustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment, gradually increase the pace and limit exercise or work time.  Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; sunglasses to protect the eyes; and a wide-brimmed hat to provide shade and keep the head cool.  Take special precaution with infants and young children by dressing them in loose, cool clothing and shading their heads and faces with hats or an umbrella. Protect their feet with shoes.  Avoid heat-related illness:   Never leave infants, children or pets inside a parked vehicle.  Increase fluid intake, regardless of activity level. Dont wait until thirsty to drink fluids; drink more liquid than ones thirst indicates.  Avoid "heat hangover." Continue to drink fluids even after strenuous activity. This will enable the body to maintain optimum hydration, and help prevent the after effects of heat exposure such as headaches and fatigue.  Avoid beverages containing alcohol, caffeine or large amounts of sugar as they dehydrate the body.</field>

		<field name="content">Crime is generally low in most of the state, the main exceptions being the larger cities. Even though many small-town Arkansans view Little Rock as a particularly dangerous and unsafe city, its violent crime rates are in line with other United States cities of similar size. Property crime is more prevalent.   Drunk driving can be a danger, especially in rural areas at night. Arkansas is divided between "wet" and "dry" counties, so many drinkers in the state must drive 10-30 miles away from home for a good time.</field>

		<field name="name">social issues</field>
		<field name="content">In terms of race relations, Arkansas has progressed in many respects since the 1950s. However, many small towns in the state, especially in the highlands, are mostly or entirely white, and people of color may attract stares or unwanted attention. People of Hispanic background may be assumed to be recent immigrants. Likewise, some areas of the Delta, and of the cities of Little Rock, North Little Rock, and Pine Bluff are almost entirely African-American; and even absent overt racial tensions; poverty is widespread in these areas, and wealthier visitors of any background need to be aware of economic and social tensions. However, some areas in larger towns and cities are decidedly integrated.  Gay and lesbian travelers may face unwanted attention or hostility in Arkansas, as Arkansas is generally a very socially conservative state.  Little Rock  does have an active GLBT community and clubs and other places which are decidedly gay friendly. The rest of Arkansas, even larger towns, have very limited opportunities for openly gay travelers or residents. That being said, in  Eureka Springs , a famous resort town, most people are accepting and it has a flourishing GLBT community.</field>

		<field name="content">The crime rate is relatively low for an urban area by American standards. Violent crime perpetrated by strangers is nearly unheard of, but property crime is more common. If you are parked at a trailhead or in a park, keep your valuables out of sight, or better yet leave them where youre staying.   There are few areas of the city that couldnt be considered safe at all hours of the day and night. The downtown bar scene sometimes attracts a drunk and somewhat rowdy crowd at night, and a few street corners downtown attract groups of loiterers that have occasionally become belligerent. But overall no unusual precautions need be taken.  Certain areas in Alabama neighbourhood should be avoided.</field>

		<field name="name">be prepared</field>
		<field name="content">The isolation and ruggedness that makes Big Bend appealing for some also brings with it a potential for danger mdash; for those who are not prepared. The vast majority of trips go off without a hitch but taking a few simple steps of precaution can make a huge difference should the unforeseeable occur. Prepare equally no matter what your itinerary is mdash; even for short hikes or if you dont plan on getting out of the car. Bring plenty of water; too much is better than not enough. The minimum requirement is at least one gallon a day, although if youre active, its much more. Thirst is a notoriously unreliable indicator of your bodys water needs, so drink regularly.  Dressing properly is an important way to beat the elements and is just as important as water. Plan for both hot and cold; temperatures here can shift dramatically (especially during winter), depending on the time of day, the weather, and your current elevation mdash; it is cooler in the mountains and warmest near the river. Dressing in layers is best; you can peel off layers when you get too warm or maybe even don a jacket if it gets nippy. Forget shorts and t-shirts; the best way to beat the desert heat is to wear light-colored, loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants mdash; breathable fabrics such as cotton are best. Also wear a hat (wide-brimmed is best), sunscreen, and practical footwear mdash; definitely closed-toed; ideally sturdy hiking boots.   The final component, but equally important, is having the right equipment. Have the right maps, whether it be road maps, trail maps, or topographical maps and a compass for backcountry exploration. For cars, make sure your tires are properly inflated (dont forget the spare tire!) and bring a jack; also consider extras such as coolant, oil, and fuel. Always have a first-aid kit, a flashlight, blankets, and an emergency signaling device of some sort mdash; a whistle is a cheap example (three blows is standard for emergencies) but flares or a signaling mirror are alternatives. Know how to use your equipment, otherwise theyre useless. And of course dont forget your camera!</field>

		<field name="content">When bad weather does come, its often in the form of thunderstorms. Even moderate amounts of rain can cause flash flooding, washing out roads or leaving them otherwise impassable mdash; especially the unpaved backroads and sections of the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive, where flood gauges are often present. A car can be swept away in as little as one foot of water; if there is even the slightest doubt if its safe to cross, wait it out mdash; water drains away quickly in the park. Be careful when hiking in washes and pour-offs mdash; flash floods can occur even if its not raining nearby; never camp in these areas. Rain in Big Bend is often accompanied by lightning mdash; if youre caught outside, stay low, try to get indoors or in your car, and stay off of hills and ridges and away from trees.</field>

		<field name="content">Bring in all the water you will need for your trip; fresh water is a rare and precious resource in the park. Springs and other natural water sources are not reliable mdash; never stake your life on them. Water fountains can be found at all park visitor centers and bottled water available from stores. If you must drink naturally-occurring water, boil it or use another reliable purifying method to kill any microorganisms. Drinking from the river is never safe; it contains pollutants and other nasties that can make you seriously ill, no matter how much you filter it. The water here is shared among all life in this harsh environment, so take care not to contaminate water sources in any way mdash; no swimming, wading, soap, or trash.</field>

		<field name="name">wildlife</field>
		<field name="content">Big Bend is a wonderful place to see a wide variety of wildlife but keep in mind they really are "wild". Never try to touch or feed an animal; not only will it make them unnaturally habituated to human contact, but they are also potentially dangerous. Some, such as deer or javelina, can cause you serious physical harm (javelinas, cute as they may be, have very sharp tusks). Others, such as raccoons, rodents, or bats, may carry nasty diseases. Poisonous snakes, scorpions, spiders, and centipedes also live here though are usually active at night. They often seek safety in dark places; check inside unattended shoes and sleeping bags before using them and watch where you step and place your hands mdash; they like to hide in holes, crevices, and under rocks. Be wary of spines and thorns from cacti and other plants mdash; sturdy shoes and pants offer some protection.  The Chisos Mountains is mountain lion and black bear country. Theyre a very rare sight and most visitors consider themselves lucky if they see them (if you do, be sure to report it to a park ranger). Black bears almost always run from humans; to avoid surprising one, make noise while you travel. Although smaller and less aggressive than the brown bear, they can be just as dangerous. Never get between a mother bear and her cubs. If you see a bear nearby and it hasnt already run away, do not approach it, instead calmly back away. Always properly dispose of your trash using the bear-proof disposal bins found throughout the area. At camps, use the numerous provided food storage lockers and keep everything else with strong odors sealed air-tight.   Mountain lions (often called "panthers" around these parts) are an even rarer sight; they tend to be active at night and keep to themselves, although a few attacks have occurred in the past (although less than you count on one hand). Stay close together in groups if traveling through an area known for mountain lion activity mdash; there are usually signs posted. If one approaches you, make yourself seem as big as possible, yell in a commanding voice, throw rocks and sticks, and generally raise as much hell as you can. If one does actually attack, fight back with all your might; do not run or play dead. Its worth reiterating, however, that the chances of even seeing a bear or mountain lion in the park (let alone being attacked) is extremely low.</field>

		<field name="content">Swimming or even wading in the river is strongly discouraged; the murky waters hide large rocks and branches, sudden drops, and strong currents. More visitors have lost their lives swimming or wading here than by boating.  The chances of being a victim of crime of any sort in the park are very low but not unheard of; if it does happen, its usually in the form of unattended cars getting broken into (such as when parked in remote areas). Use common sense and youll be fine; hide valuables from view or in the trunk or, better yet, leave them home.  There have been reports of illegal crossings from the Mexican side and other illicit activities such as stolen items and car break-ins near the River Road West area. This area is little-traveled by casual visitors (you need a high-clearance vehicle to reach it) and most who stay there have no problem, but if theres any cause for discomfort or alarm, consider staying in another area and be sure to report anything illegal or suspicious to park dispatch at +1 432 477-2251.</field>

		<field name="content">Boulder has a very low crime rate and has no bad neighborhoods, but use common sense. University Hill, which is bordered by Baseline, Broadway, and Canyon can become raucous in the evenings, especially on weekends. Downtown Boulder, especially at night, is frequented by panhandlers, who can be aggressive at times but are not dangerous. Aggressive panhandling is illegal in Boulder, and you may report it to the police. Throughout the hiking trails near university property, Boulder has black posts lit with a blue light that have emergency phones in them that only dial 911. Due to a growing number of rapes during the 2008/2009 school year, it is not advised for girls to walk alone after 1AM on the hill or near Pearl St. Mall. Boulder has also had several recent reports of violence against Asian individuals</field>

		<field name="content">Thousands of U.S citizens visit the state of Baja California, Mexico from California every year with the majority of travelers returning from an enjoyable experience.  However, a minority of travelers do experience difficulties and serious inconveniences while traveling to Mexico.  Before traveling to Mexico, ensure that you have the proper documentation and are familiar with the recommendations for foreign travel from the  U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs   There are six border crossings between California and Mexico: two between San Diego and Tijuana, one between Tecate and Tecate, two between Calexico and Mexicali, and one between Andrade and Los Algodones.  The United States operates a consulate-general in Tijuana and a consulate in Mexicali. Mexico operates Consulates in Calexico, Fresno, Los Angeles, Oxnard, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Santa Ana.</field>

		<field name="content">Due to Californias proximity to the International Boundary with Mexico, visitors should be cautious while in areas near the border.   Know where you are at all times, follow good safety procedures and use common sense when making decisions.  Do not pick-up hitch hikers.  Keep valuables, including spare change, out of sight and lock your vehicle.  Avoid traveling in well-marked but unofficial "trails."  Avoid hiking or camping in areas of major border activity. If you are visiting a national or state park, consult park staff  to help plan backcountry travel in safer areas.  Report any suspicious behavior to the U.S. Border Patrol.</field>

		<field name="name">crime</field>
		<field name="content">The usual inner city crime can be found in the worst parts of  Los Angeles ,  San Francisco , and  Oakland .  Central Valley cities, such as  Sacramento ,  Stockton , and  Fresno  also have gang problems. Northern coastal cities such as  Eureka  have an ongoing problem with significant drug activity, primarily the prevalence of methamphetamine, and property crimes. However, most California cities are very safe.  As long as you take basic precautions against petty crime and stay out of obviously run-down neighborhoods, you will probably have a safe and pleasant visit. Be smart and you will be safe.  If you are traveling along the Pacific Coast Highway or Highway 101, you may notice there are a substantial number of hitch-hikers along the way. Do NOT pick up hitch-hikers.  Drugs are illegal in California. That being said, California has one of the most tolerant positions regarding marijuana in the country. In some parts of California (San Francisco, Mendencino County, Oakland, Santa Cruz, Parts of Los Angeles, Coastal San Diego, parts of Lake Tahoe), a very European attitude toward marijuana can often be found. While possession without a doctors recommendation is still illegal, it is considered a minor offense. If you are caught you will either be told to throw it away, or at worst given a $100 fine. It is always best to be discreet and avoid doing things that will bring attention in public.  If you find yourself in an emergency situation (of any kind), dial 911 on your phone.</field>

		<field name="content">Earthquakes that are large enough to cause extensive damage are rare, but remain a matter of reality for the state.  The biggest dangers in an earthquake are falling objects and windows which shatter explosively.  In the event of an earthquake, face away from windows and hide under any sturdy table or desk that may be available.  If you are indoors, do not run outside!  Falling building facades are more likely to cause severe injuries than anything inside. Contrary to popular belief  do not stand in a door frame it is not safe at all, this is merely a myth. Youre more likely to get your fingers caught in the frame from all the shaking and swinging of the door than gain protection from a falling object. If outdoors, stay away from buildings and stay out from under power lines.</field>

		<field name="content">Along the southern most border of California-Nevada, as well as the border of California-Arizona, California has elaborate desert landscapes which extend into the south central regions of the state; the most famous (or infamous) being the region known as  Death Valley , where several tourists and hikers have indeed met their fate while exploring the region.  If you are planning on traveling or hiking into these locations, follow desert survival guidelines. Be sure to take plenty of water (at least one gallon per person, per day), sunscreen and wear light clothing. Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to  return.   Be sure to have a full tank of gasoline prior to traveling by car into these regions, as many desert locations are extremely remote and without any services for several miles (in some cases nearly 100 miles). To break down in these regions could be extremely unpleasant in the best case scenario, tragic in the worst.  Also, it is best to hike during the earlier part of the day, as thunderstorms tend to develop suddenly during the afternoon. In the event you encounter inclement weather conditions, seek high ground immediately! Thunderstorms can cause flash flooding in canyons and other low laying areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Dehydration is a serious concern. The aridity of the air is deceptive--you will perspire and exhale moisture from your mouth and nose without even realizing it.  If youre going to hike anywhere in Colorado,  take plenty of water (at least one gallon per person, per day), decent nonslip boots or sneakers, as well as layers of clothing. Always hike with a waterproof jacket--more people die of hypothermia in Colorado in the summer simply by being caught unaware. Let people know where you are going and when you expect to get back.   Be careful and watch for lightning while hiking, especially in the high country. Its often best to hike in the early morning to avoid the possibility of hitting an afternoon thunderstorm.</field>

		<field name="content">Mountain goat on Mount Huron near Leadville  The eastern plains region of Colorado is in tornado alley.  Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms with high winds and hail are not uncommon during the spring and summer months. Make sure you keep a radio on in the car. Should you hear the tornado sirens sounding, locate a suitable tornado shelter at once--do not stay outdoors to get a picture!  Also, do not try to outrun the tornado in your car!  You may wind up driving directly into the tornados path.    Should the skies be cloudy, and the light take on a greenish-yellow cast, this is an indication of an imminent hail storm--again, seek shelter at once.  Keep in mind, these storms are spread over a wide area and many residents have never seen a tornado; however, Colorado residents do not hesitate to run to the basement/cellar if a tornado warning is announced.

		<field name="content">Of the 25 species of snakes in Colorado, only two are venomous: the western rattlesnake, which lives almost everywhere, and the massasauga, which is limited to the grassy lands of the Eastern Plains. If you are afraid of snakes, head for the cool, highest elevations of the Rockies. Western rattlers cant live above 7,500 to 9,500 ft (2134 to 2743 m).   Rattlesnakes are more afraid of you than you are of them. If you hear a rattle, its a warning. Freeze and look around for the snake. Move cautiously away from the snake once you locate it, even if it means cutting your hike short.  Do not try to kill or further antagonize the snake, as this may lead to additional bites.  If you are bitten, the good news is that you almost certainly will live through the painful experience. Remain as calm as possible. Rattlesnake venom is essentially digestive enzymes, and will break down tissue around the bite. Try not to move much (which spreads the venom) unless you must do so. Painful swelling of lymph nodes in the groin or armpit usually occurs within one hour if the bite is on the leg or arm. Call emergency medical services (911) and/or a poison control center. There is antivenin available for use against all native pit vipers in the US.</field>

		<field name="name">altitude sickness</field>
		<field name="content">Mile High Marker on the State Capitol building   Altitude sickness or Acute Mountain Sickness is an ailment that potentially anyone can have when they visit areas with higher altitudes than they are used to, due to decreases in barometric pressure (though not oxygen content). Denver is called the Mile High City for a reason—at an altitude of a mile above sea level, one can start to experience some of the effects of altitude sickness though generally this condition becomes more pronounced at elevations around 8000nbsp;ft (2500 m) and above. Some normal changes may occur when people travel to higher altitudes that are not altitude sickness. These include the following:  Hyperventilation (breathing faster and/or deeper than normal)  Shortness of breath after exertion  Changes in nightly breathing  Awaking at night  Increased urination  The above are generally nothing to worry about, though problems with breathing may be helped by a drug called acetazolamide. If you think you may have problems, get advice from your doctor before traveling to Denver.  Some people get Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), which can be serious, at the higher elevations you will experience if you are touring through the Rocky Mountains. A diagnosis of AMS is usually given if a person has a headache accompanied by one of more of the following symptoms:  Loss of appetite, vomiting and/or nausea  Fatigue or weakness  Dizziness or light-headedness  Insomnia, difficulty sleeping  Some people liken AMS to a bad hangover or worse. It occurs because your brain tissue swells at higher elevations than it is used to. If you are feeling unwell at high altitudes, assume that you are suffering from AMS unless there is another logical explanation that would be accompanied by other symptoms (food poisoning or a viral infection).  To avoid AMS, try to get to a lower elevation until your symptoms subside, drink lots of fluid to avoid dehydration, and avoid traveling at high rates of ascent. If the symptoms continue or worsen, travel to a lower altitude.  AMS can turn into High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), a potentially fatal condition where the brain swells so much that it ceases to function properly. Symptoms of HACE include confusion, inability to think clearly, lethargy, ataxia (walking staggerdly, as if one was drunk), and changes in behavior. The person may not recognize having HACE, but if you any of you experiences any of these symptoms (especially ataxia), immediately make sure the person is taken to lower elevations for medical treatment.  Another very serious condition, called High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) causes fluid in the lungs. If someone suffers chest tightness, congestion, gurgling breaths, blue or gray fingers or lips, cough producing frothy or pink liquid, and difficulty breathing even at rest, they should be taken to a lower elevation and receive medical treatment immediately.  Although not particularly common, keep in mind that these illnesses are possible and that anyone is susceptible to them, even if you have traveled to high elevations before.  Another medical concern at higher elevations, particularly those in Colorado and Denver, is sunburn and skin cancer. The higher elevation means that there is less atmosphere protecting the skin from harmful solar radiation. This is especially true in Colorado, with both dry air that saps the skin of protective moisture and with the beautifully sunny days we have in the state.  Colorado actually has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, so it is always a good idea to wear a lot of high SPF sun-screen, hats, long sleeve shirts and pants. Dont think that you are protected from the sun in the winter either. The suns rays can actually be reflected by the snow on the ground, still causing skin damage, so when in Colorado, do as the locals do, and  wear sunscreen on any exposed skin surface at any time of the year.</field>

Wildlife can be abundant along roads during all seasons. Please observe speed limits and be aware of wildlife in the road corridor.  Four wheel drive may not be enough on some monument roads. Many park roads are clay-surfaced (unpaved), and become impassable when wet no matter what kind of vehicle you have. Get weather and road condition reports before traversing park roads.</field>

		<field name="content">Dinosaur is a land of extremes; please dress appropriately for the season. Summer temperatures can soar over 100F (38C); winter temperatures can drop well below 0 F (-18C). Summer nighttime temperatures can be cool. Dress appropriately, including proper shoes and headwear, use sunscreen. Dressing in non-cotton layers allows you to add and remove clothing as needed while not retaining moisture that can lead to hypothermia.  Always carry and drink plenty of water. Extreme temperatures, high elevation, and an arid landscape can lead to rapid water loss. Many locations may not have water readily accessible and may require backpackers/hikers to carry fresh water. All water gathered in the monument must be treated before consumption.</field>

		<field name="content">Watch Your Step. Trails are often rocky and uneven, and other hazards may be present. Slow down, enjoy the scenery, and watch your step.  Carry food with you. At higher elevations your body must work harder than at lower elevations; more work means more calories burned. The monument ranges from 4700 feet to over 9000 feet in elevation. Salty foods can replace electrolytes lost through sweating. Eating helps your body use water efficiently.  Afternoon thunderstorms during summer are common, and lighting can strike from miles away.  During summer thunderstorms avoid high, bare rock surfaces to prevent being struck by lightning.  If caught outside find the lowest point possible that is not near a tree or other tall object, and make yourself small/short.  Also be aware of flash flooding in canyons; a storm miles away can send a wall of water raging down a canyon, flooding it within minutes, emptying just as fast.</field>

		<field name="content">Most wildlife is more scared of you than you are of them. You might, however, surprise or startle wildlife or accidentally make an animal feel threatened. Watch where you walk; if you do come across wildlife, give it plenty of space as well as an escape route. Small children and pets may be particularly vulnerable – keep your group together at all times. Be wary of animals that are being aggressive.  Snakes are an important and beneficial part of the ecosystem. Most snakes found in the monument are non-poisonous, but two are poisonous: the midget faded rattlesnake, and prairie rattlesnake. Snakes, like all wildlife in the monument, should be observed and enjoyed from a safe distance.  Plants can bite, too. Many plants, including cactus, greasewood, Russian thistle, and others can scratch, stick, or otherwise be dangerous. Watch where you put your hands and feet.</field>

		<field name="content">Heat in the Summer. During the summer months when temperatures nearly always stay around 90 degrees to 100 or more degrees Fahrenheit, the biggest dangers facing visitors are dehydration and heat stroke. El Paso is in a desert and it is important for all visitors to remember to drink enough water at all times. Too many people fail to take the heat seriously. The dry heat can actually feel less hot than it really is to many people. Learn to recognize the signs of danger for dehydration and heat stroke. Heat stroke is very serious. Take care of yourself in the heat. And remember a cowboy word of wisdom: If youre thirsty, youre already dehydrated. For more information, consult the article for this  region .  Sun. Not just for the heat, but the sun can be dangerous because of UV rays which are much stronger at El Pasos altitude than at sea level. Wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. It is not uncommon to see pedestrians in El Paso walking with an umbrella to shield them from the sun.  Rain. During the rainy season (usually late June to early October) be aware that flash flooding can occur during and after rainfall. Areas closer to the Rio Grande are much more susceptible to flooding and standing water. Poor drainage and the dry desert soil ensure that even moderate rainfall can result in street flooding, especially in underpasses. Visitors who are in El Paso during the rare times of rain should remember to never drive into a flooded street. In addition, since El Pasoans are not used to driving in the rain, accidents are more likely to occur.  Snow and ice. While El Paso winters are generally mild, cold weather can occur. In general, winter is a dry season in El Paso; however, when snow and icy conditions exist, take extreme caution, as El Pasoans are not used to driving in these conditions.  Wind and dust. El Pasos windy season is generally from January through April. During this time, high winds and blowing dust can make breathing difficult, especially for asthma sufferers. Blowing dust and sand can also reduce visibility on roads, especially in rural areas surrounding El Paso. Area highways may close during high winds.  Mosquitoes. Along with rain comes mosquitoes. Yes, El Paso is a desert, but many residents own pools and water gardens. These can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The Rio Grande area also has mosquito problems. The West Nile Virus has been recorded in El Paso. The best advice is to remember to wear a good insect repellent if you will be outdoors in the evening. The area around Hueco Tanks can be very bad, mosquito-wise. Some local weather websites will tell visitors the projected mosquito danger.</field>

		<field name="content">Theres no reason to fear the mountains, as long as you approach them with proper respect and preparation. As with anywhere else, recklessness and a lack of forethought can get you into trouble, especially in Colorados vast back country.    Altitude sickness  - Can lead to dizziness, headaches, nausea, even blackouts and pulmonary edema. Give your body a few days to adjust to the high altitudes before going full throttle with your hiking or skiing.   Dehydration - When you engage in strenuous outdoor activities, be sure to replenish your fluids as you go. You may be losing moisture through your mouth and nose and through sweating, but be completely unawares due to the arid mountain air. May result in dizziness, intense thirst and elevated heart and breath rates.   Giardia - Drinking untreated water from regional streams is not a good idea owing to Giardia parasites, but tap water is not a problem.   Hypothermia - Prolonged exposure to the cold can result in confusion, a slowed heart rate, lethargy, even death. Dress warmly in non cotton clothing to allow any sweat to wick away from your body and evaporate. Otherwise, it may thoroughly chill you later in the day when temperatures drop.   Frostbite - During periods of severe cold, your circulatory system pulls all your warming blood into the core of your body to protect your vital organs. This makes your extremities such as your ears, fingers and nose especially vulnerable. Wear a face mask, insulated gloves and other heavy gear on the worst winter days. It gets cold sitting still on those ski lifts!  Sunburn - Lather up with sunscreen, even if theres cloud cover. Colorados high elevation means you have less protection to the suns powerful ultra violet rays. This can be compounded while skiing or snowboarding, when the rays are reflected off the snow and hits the underside of your jaw. Dont forget to wear UV-rated goggles or sunglasses, as well. Theres nothing more painful than sunburned eyeballs.</field>

		<field name="content">Avalanches - Colorado claims about a third of all avalanche deaths in the U.S. The ski resorts have groomed slopes that are are safe, but it is extremely dangerous to ski or snowboard outside of the designated terrain. Its popular amongst daredevil skiers to "run the chutes," steep, shaded slopes that funnel into tight gullies. These are classic avalanche zones. Far more common (and deadly) are slab avalanches that break along a fault line and bury unsuspecting snow mobilers or skiers. Always wear a homing beacon and check the conditions at the  Colorado Avalanche Information Center  before heading into the back country.   Lightning - This is especially deadly in the high country above timberline when no shelter is nearby. If you hear crackling or hissing sounds, or your hair begins to stand on end, squat down immediately in the "lightning desperation position" - feet together and your hands clapped over your ears. Remember, a tent and inflatable mattress offer no protection from a lightning strike. Avoid the high ground, or solitary objects like trees that stick out higher than the surrounding terrain (they may act like natural lightning rods).

		<field name="name">crime</field>
		<field name="content">It should be considered of utmost importance that anyone considering visiting Greenville realize that the town is notorious for its bad crime, often considered to be among of the worst in the country. The downtown area in particular and much of the town north of Highway 82 (this highway often seen as a sort of "dividing line" by many) is continuously ridden with theft, assault, and much more, sometimes even in daylight and in popular areas such as near the library or churches. If one must go into more dangerous parts of Greenville, it is still better to do so in the day, and to be accompanied with other people; it is less dangerous for a female to go along with males. The most that can be done to protect oneself is to use the most common sense as possible, such as always locking ones car and never leaving valuable items inside, staying away from dark and deserted areas and not taking dangerous routes when it isnt necessary, and not drawing too much attention to oneself (i.e., wearing expensive jewelry or females wearing too revealing of clothes). While police have made some attempts to monitor and patrol downtown Greenville more, many residents complain that the towns police force is still highly ineffective. Much of south Greenville - for example, along Highway 1 South near the Nelco Movie Theater and Country Club, South Main Street near the Bowmanor Subdivision and Bayou Road, and the area surrounding Cypress Road - is considered to be generally safe and inhabited by middle- to upper-class families, although some crime occasionally drifts into these areas as well.</field>

		<field name="name">racism</field>
		<field name="content">It should also be noted that Greenville is a town of ever-present and prominent racial discord, despite moderate progress since the 1950s. Many older, more upper-class whites (a small yet powerful minority) in particular still harbor views of varying degrees of racism, although this phenomenon is significantly less common in most middle-aged or younger whites (yet still very pronounced in others). Socializing and mixing with blacks too much could possibly be discouraged by some middle-aged white parents today, though it would have been a lot more common a few decades ago. Conversely, some blacks (whose race accounts for about 70% of the towns population) hold to what is commonly referred to as "reverse racism;" for example, it is often hard for a white teenager to find a job in local fast food or retail establishments where the management and all the employees are black. A visiting black man could possibly be looked down on by a white man, and vice versa. Both races often tend to form their own areas in the town, with a few middle-class areas being more or less mixed.</field>

		<field name="content">Like most large US cities, Houston has its share of crime. Residents of Texas are allowed to carry concealed firearms after completing training and a thorough background check. Almost all people who possess a firearm do so responsibly, and crime among this group is practically nonexistent. Like many other US cities, certain areas of Houston are considerably less safe including the area within Loop 610 on the east side and some areas in Southwest Houston near Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway).   Travelers to Houston should follow common safety procedures such as staying away from deserted areas in the middle of the night, keeping their valuables stored out of sight, keeping purses/wallets in a secure location, and always put valuables in a car trunk. For emergency assistance, travelers can contact Houston Police Department by dialing 911. In addition, travelers should dial 911 to report most crimes in progress. For non-emergency assistance and for crimes not in progress such as minor assault, car theft, home invasion, property damage, and theft, dial 713-884-3131 and request police assistance. The Houston Police Department also allows citizens to file online reports for minor property damage and theft if they are under $5,000 in damages.</field>

		<field name="content">Houston is like much of the Gulf Coast in that it is very vulnerable to hurricanes in the summer and fall. If a hurricane is forecast to make landfall anywhere near Houston, listen to officials and heed mandatory evacuation orders if one is ordered. The last major hurricane to hit Houston was Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008.   Houston is very hot and humid in the summer, with temperatures around 31°C-38°C (87°F-100°F), and summer climate in Houston is easily comparable to the average climates in tropical cities like  Manila  or  Panama City  during the summer. However, in the winter, Houston can be mild with temperatures ranging from -1°C-18°C (30°F-64°F), and winter climate is usually comparable to winters in the rest of the Southern United States or  Southern California .</field>

		<field name="name">metro rail</field>
		<field name="content">Unlike other large cities in the nation such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles, Houston doesnt have a local rail rapid transit network in place. METRO Rail is the initial line of what is planned to be a rapid transit system. The line starts at UofH Downtown, through downtown, into Midtown, to Texas Medical Center, and then the Reliant Complex near the south side, for a length of just over seven miles. Houstonians have a tendency to park along the rail line or the south side lot to go into downtown or the medical center as it is easier to get in and out of those areas with the train without the hassle of parking and traffic.  Please be careful when coming near the METRO Rail track, especially at intersections.   Follow the signs since the trains move very quickly and run at almost all hours of the day and night. It runs almost silently. At many streets, left turns are not permitted. Also watch the signs and signals, because some will change as trains approach. Do not drive on the tracks as there are large raised white domes that separate the roadway and the rail line. In some areas signs may indicate driving (or walking) on the tracks is permitted (currently only in the Texas Medical Center) but make sure it is safe to do so.  Drive across the tracks only when you are sure it is safe to do so, especially at night as an oncoming train may not be heard by a driver inside a car.</field>

		<field name="content">The two cities of major concern in regards to criminal activity are  Chicago  and  East St. Louis .   Over the years  Chicago  has seen a drop in its violent crime rate, but this does not mean violent crime is not alive and well within its limits. There is significant gang activity within the city and its outskirts, which should not be a surprise seeing as it is the third most populous city in the country. Stay vigilant and use common sense; these two practices will most often aid you in avoiding bad situations. If you find yourself in a bad part of the city, chances are you will be able to tell from its appearance. It is not advised to travel into certain districts and neighborhoods after dark; do your research to find out which areas are most unsavory for the out of town traveler.   East St. Louis  is one of the countrys most notorious cities for violent crime. The city has little of tourist interest aside from the casino riverboat. If you are able to avoid it, then it is best to do so.</field>

		<field name="content">Kansas is central within the countrys "tornado alley". Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms with high winds and hail are not uncommon during the spring and summer months.  Make sure you keep a radio on in the car. Should you hear the tornado sirens sounding, locate a suitable tornado shelter at once - DO NOT stay outdoors to get a picture!  Also, DO NOT try to outrun the tornado in your car! Tornadoes can shift their paths very suddenly and you may wind up driving directly into it.  Should the skies be cloudy, and the light take on a greenish-yellow cast, this is an indication of an imminent hail storm - again, seek shelter at once.  Keep in mind, these storms are spread over a wide area and many residents have never seen a tornado; however, tornado drills are a regular part for all Kansas school children and residents do not hesitate to run to the basement/cellar if a tornado warning is announced.

Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals! Check trail head postings at parks for recent activity and be aware of rules keeping a distance from Orca Whales and other marine animals while boating. Regulations for killer whales require that boaters stay 200 yards away keep path of the whales clear.  These new U.S. regulations apply to all vessels (with some exceptions) in inland waters of Washington.  Dont disturb resting seal pups, keep children and dogs away and report to the local stranding hotline (253)589-7235.  Seal pups haul out to get much needed rest when they are young and are often alone for many hours.  They are extremely vulnerable at this time and should be left alone.  Only about 50% of Puget Sound seal pups make it through their first year so please help to protect their health.</field>

Lock your car doors and exercise sensible precautions with valuables, especially when parking your car at a trail head or marina when you may be away from your car for awhile. It would also be advisable to carry anything of value out of sight.</field>

		<field name="content">Remain vigilant while driving. Las Vegas Boulevard ("the Strip") is notorious for fender benders and other traffic collisions as a result of the heavy stop-and-go traffic and the numerous distractions (pirates, volcanoes, women) offered to drivers.  Some part of Interstate 15 is always under construction to relieve its perennial traffic jams.  The current portion under construction is between Blue Diamond Road and Tropicana Avenue.  The construction zones tend to have inadequate signage and poor lane markings, which combined with the large number of tourists results in frequent last-minute lane changes and in turn, many multi-vehicle car accidents.  Many people are also driving intoxicated as well; Nevada has an unusually high frequency of traffic deaths with alcohol involved, and most of them happen in and near this city.</field>

		<field name="content">During the spring and summer seasons, the state (particularly its southern region) has the tendency to experience violent thunderstorms which do, on occasion, spawn tornadoes. It is a good idea to pay attention to weather conditions during these seasons to maintain an awareness of any potential for these severe storms to occur. Keep in mind that weather conditions change very quickly, and therefore, frequently updating yourself in regards to the conditions is something to consider while traveling to or through the state during the spring/summer seasons.

		<field name="name">winter storms</field>
		<field name="content">Minnesota also can have very cold winters and very warm, humid summers. Be sure to pack accordingly.  When traveling outside major metropolitan areas during winter months it is advisable to take extra blankets or warm weather gear in the event of an accident or mechanical difficulties.  One rule of thumb for native Minnesotans is to always have your vehicles gas tank at least half full during the winter months.  The high temperatures during the winter are typically in 10-30 degree range, but can go below zero a few weeks during the winter.  Native Minnesotans are taught to bundle up and wear layers during the winter at a very early age.  You might also note that unlike many other states, Minnesotans are quite accustomed to driving on icy and snowy roads. Furthermore, the Minnesota Department of Motor Vehicles has a great number of snowplows that clear and salt roads after snowstorms. Therefore do not be surprised if businesses and schools remain open even after a heavy snowfall.    In winter months, make sure to check the ice thickness before going out on a frozen lake or pond. Do not park your vehicle on a lake or pond unless it is deemed safe by the local DNR officers. Never walk on river ice. It may appear safe but may not be thick enough to support your weight, due to the river current flowing underneath.</field>

		<field name="content">When driving at night, keep in mind that most highway roads and even a majority of the Interstate routes in Mississippi do not have lights posted on the sides of the roads, making the roads very dark at night.  This can sometimes make driving a little more challenging, as you have to always anticipate wild animals (and sometimes wild drivers) darting out in front of you at a moments notice.  Be aware that during the winter season when it gets dark, that it is not uncommon to have wild deer stray across roads with oncoming traffic, only to have motorist crash directly into them as there is rarely any time to avoid the deer.</field>

It is common to learn of a hunting accident where a victim was accidentally shot and killed by a hunter.  If you do intend to trek the wooded areas during hunting season, use caution and always wear a bright "hunters" orange vest, so other hunters will not mistake you for wild game.  Considering the risk of personal injury, it would be wise to avoid the some of the wooded areas (especially during deer season - for usage of firearms it is typically from mid November till mid December).  Dont assume that just because a land owner who has posted their land as being off-limits for hunting, that determined hunters will abide by the rules.</field>

Do not engage this person, and immediately walk away without saying anything.  It might be wise to alert the casinos security personnel of the event as most casinos in Mississippi are active in removing panhandlers and nuisances from their property quickly (as they do not want to acquire a reputation of having their customers being harassed by panhandlers).</field>

If you are visiting the rivers in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, Salem (population 5,000) is the city that most people have to travel through on the way to the rivers and they have 3 lodging facilities, including 1 major national chain.  Lock your doors and take anything, and I mean anything you dont want to have stolen from your car inside your room with you.  This city has a very high theft rate, especially from automobiles parked in the hotel parking lots.  Chances are your stuff will be missing if you leave it in your car overnight.  Also lock your car tight and make sure that if you have an alarm it is turned on as a few vehicles have been stolen in the past year.</field>

Animals can be attracted to food and other scents. Human food is both unhealthy for animals and can lead to potentially dangerous encounters with bears.   Try to have your sleeping area about 100 yards (90 m) up wind from your cooking area. Keep sleeping gear free of food odors and cosmetic scents.  Store food, garbage and toiletry items in either bear-resistant canisters (available on loan from National Park Service offices) or strung up 15 feet (5 m) off the ground and at least 5 feet (1.5 m) from tree trunks.  Pack out all food waste.  Never feed wildlife.</field>

		<field name="content">In the cities of  Omaha  and  Lincoln  crime rates have begun to rise due to the increase in population these two cities have experienced over the past several years. These crime rates do vary considerably among neighborhoods, however, it is important to take proper precautions and use the same degrees of common sense you would ordinarily implement while visiting a mid-size American city. If an area appears decrepit and/or seedy, then you probably do not want to remain there for any length of time.   These two cities have also experienced an increase in gang activity. This should is something to be aware of, but generally crime of this nature is inter-gang related and does not affect the ordinary citizen. Nevertheless, dont put yourself in a position that could lead you to becoming caught in the crossfire of rival gangs.</field>

		<field name="name">crime</field>
		<field name="content">Albuquerque  has a crime rate that is higher than average for an American city, but most of it is property crime that affects residents more than visitors.  The "South Valley" and the region between the University of New Mexico and Kirtland Air Force Base (as well as the infamous "War Zone" near the state fairgrounds, the site of some nasty drug-related crime) are best avoided by solitary travelers after dark.  Otherwise there are no specific violent-crime issues that unduly threaten the visitor.  Illegal immigrants are a problem in the southern region of the state, although less of one than in neighboring  Arizona .  Use caution when picking up hitchhikers (or hitchhiking yourself) here.  There are checkpoints along major highways leading north, at which the Border Patrol checks vehicles for illegal passengers.  Behave sensibly with them and you wont have any problems.  There are some social problems associated with the drug trade that may create unpleasant situations for the unwary visitor in some areas.  The world-wide cautions regarding packages from strangers apply here too, and, in addition, some caution is indicated in rural areas of the north central and northwestern regions.  The former is a notorious "pipeline" for narcotics entering the country from Mexico, and you really dont want to blunder into a drug deal being transacted in the hinterlands.  The main drug-related hazard in the rugged northwest is that it is a "drop zone" for contraband delivered by light plane.  If you see a small plane drop below the local horizon when you know there is no airport around, dont investigate; chances are good that a shipment of something illegal has just been delivered to waiting, unfriendly people on the ground.  This is less of a problem today than 20 years ago, but can still lead to decidedly hairy situations.  Drunk driving is a notorious social problem in New Mexico, particularly in the northern half of the state.  There is no hour of the day, and no road, immune to DUI.  Simply drive defensively.</field>

		<field name="content">Disease: New Mexico made unpleasant headlines a few years ago owing to an outbreak of the "Sin Nombre" hantaviral lung disease that claimed some lives and depressed the tourist industry.  Realistically, however, hantavirus is of very little concern to the traveler, as is the better-known bubonic plague that is endemic in the states rodent population.  Sensible precautions apply here as anywhere else (dont handle dead animals, dont poke around in animal dens, etc.), but these just arent major concerns.  Much more prevalent, if less threatening, is the Giardia parasite that causes gastro-intestinal disturbances; to avoid it, purify water if backpacking or camping.  Tap water state-wide is generally safe.  Most of the state is high desert.  When out and about, use sun screen, and if hiking, carry more water than you think youll need.  Its wise to wear long pants when hiking (particularly off-trail) in the desert, even if theyre uncomfortably warm; most of the desert flora and fauna are thorny, spiny or venomous, and long pants will help keep you from being stuck or bitten.  (Dont worry unduly about rattlesnakes, though; many long-time residents of the state have never seen one, and bites are rare.)  If bicycling, beware the dreaded "goat head," an invasive weed whose seeds, distributed in the fall, seem tailor-made for puncturing bike tires -- they look like a miniature version of the caltrops used in ancient days to hinder passage of foot soldiers.  Carry a patch kit and a spare tube, particularly in the fall.  The mountains of the north (and some near  Alamogordo  in the south) are high enough to create hazards from  altitude sickness  and some other environmental threats.  The high peaks create thunderstorms in the summer, so that the wise hiker is off the summits by 1PM or so to avoid lightning strikes.  Avalanches are fairly common in the Sangre de Cristos during the winter, and can occur in some of the other ranges.</field>

		<field name="content">Katrina alerted the world to the danger of hurricanes in this part of the world. However if one visits a place vulnerable to natural disaster, at least hurricanes give warning. During the height of the hurricane season, from July through October, be sure to check with the weather service before going to New Orleans, and if a large storm is threatening the Gulf Coast, consider a change of plans. If one threatens the city while youre there, play it safe and leave early; dont wait for an evacuation order to head away from the coast.  If you cannot get out of the area you should at least be sure to get to a hotel located on high ground (as a rule in New Orleans, the older the neighborhood, the higher the ground).</field>

		<field name="name">crime</field>
		<field name="content">The majority of the citys notorious crime problem is manifested away from the parts of town of interest to most visitors, but always be aware of your surroundings. The  Central City  neighborhood is having the worst problem, and at present should be avoided by casual visitors. The "Back of town" sections of the  7th 8th and 9th Wards  has also been having serious problems. Visitors are advised to check on current local conditions before visiting these neighborhood and take extra care if they go.  Stay out of St. Louis cemetery unless you are with a tour group. Ditto Armstrong Park, unless youre there for an event like Jazz in the Park. Avoid the Iberville project on the other side of N Rampart St, west of Armstrong Park.   While the French Quarter and attractions most visited by tourists are some of the safest areas from violent crimes, beware opportunistic thieves looking for a chance to snatch something from visitors who are not keeping an eye on their valuables. A famous 19th century sign from the Quarter reads: "Beware Pickpockets and Loose Women." Not much has changed. Tourists can be so drunk and distracted that they are separated from their common sense and, all too often, other things. Keep things in your front pockets, and be careful with your digital on Bourbon. Locals have an expression, "Nothing good happens in the Quarter after midnight". Bar bouncers are allowed to kill and injure people with impunity, so dont tangle with them.  Around parts of the French Quarter and nearby areas with many tourists, visitors can encounter hustlers who will try to get a few dollars from visitors offering anything from a flower to a hat, a foot massage, or even to clean your shoes. Another popular tourist scam is to bet a tourist $20 that the scammer knows where the tourist got their shoes.  If the tourist takes the bet, the scammer responds, "You got them on your feet" and demands the $20.  Remember that you are under no obligation to talk to people and its just best to ignore them. This is especially true of the hordes of gutter punks in the lower Quarter, near the old U.S. Mint and where Frenchman intersects with Esplanade, near the fire station.  All and all, though, the government and police are aware of the problem and are there to help you, but you can help them (and yourself) also by using one simple rule: use your common sense (as one would do in any other sizeable city). Being alone and utterly drunk is not the best state to be in when walking through a deserted alley in downtown New Orleans on a regular busy Saturday night, and during massive crowd-drawers like Mardi Gras or Southern Decadence, one should be more careful than on an average Wednesday afternoon.  Last but not least: looking for drugs or illegal activities will not only expose you to danger; if someone you just met is trying to lure you into a strange part of town for something decadent, assume youre probably being set up for a robbery or worse. Also be advised that Louisiana has the harshest sentencing laws in the country as most felonies carry a mandatory prison sentence, so conduct yourself accordingly.</field>

		<field name="content">The  poisonous rattlesnake can be stumbled on by mistake. Rattlesnakes should be avoided and never disturbed. Cougars or Mountain Lions are found in Central and Western North Dakota, occasionally even inside city limits. Never wander into remote places in North Dakota without a defensive weapon or plan in case of a cougar attack, which they will do. Bison may be beautiful but a male bison can run faster than you can and may trample or maul if it feels threatened. Always maintain a safe distance (30 yards or more) from large animals.  Coyotes have been known to venture into campgrounds and can have rabies. Otherwise coyotes wont threaten humans.  Pets should be brought indoors at night. A dog can become a snack to a group of coyotes, especially small dogs. Deer are known to cross roads all over North Dakota so drive aware of deer crossings, especially in the early morning or dusk hours.  Never forget that North Dakotas peaceful valleys can give way to challenging ravines and trenches, raging rivers and clay roads, cactus and thorns. A walk around Lake Sakakaweas beautiful shores can turn into a rescue mission, since lakes are deep shorelines are sometimes unsteady.  Rivers can be unforgiving; a child left on a sandbar playing might wander into the swift currents of the Missouri. Lifejackets are a must. In winter people have frozen to death by getting lost on snow-covered fields or roads. Lakes can ice over in the winter, but be sure you know the thickness and quality of the ice before venturing out.  (Ask a local if unsure.) Never explore North Dakota in the winter without proper gear. Blaze orange clothing during deer season is a must.    Much of North Dakotas most beautiful scenery is untouched. You are likely to be perfectly safe in North Dakotas cities and on highways. But when you travel away from the highways to reach the great scenery North Dakota has to offer, be sure to have a travel companion (or notify a trusted person of your travel plans) and plenty of supplies in case you become stranded. Since North Dakota is one of Americas least populated states, there is a lot of untouched land for you to explore.</field>

		<field name="content">Crime is not a big problem in Oklahoma.  It is safe to walk in the evenings in almost all Oklahoma cities.  Some care should be taken in the major cities of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, and Lawton due to a higher crime rate in some areas of these cities.  There are many areas of Oklahoma City that are not well lit at night.  Travelers should exercise common sense in walking in well lit areas, staying on busy streets, removing valuables from vehicles, and locking vehicles.  Most Oklahomans will readily help anyone in need regardless of whether they are known to them or a stranger.  There is very little "ice" among people in Oklahoma.  A traveler in need of assistance should expect a helpful and friendly attitude.  Travelers in need of assistance on the highway may contact the Oklahoma Highway Patrol by dialing 55 on their cellphones.</field>

		<field name="content">Oklahoma is at the epicenter of the countrys infamous "tornado alley". During the spring and summer seasons, this region is often the hub of very violent thunderstorms which can quickly become life threatening to anyone who is unprepared and in the path of a storm. If you are traveling through the state during the spring/summer months, it is crucial to be vigilant of the weather conditions because they can change rapidly. It is a good idea for the independent traveler to purchase a weather radio that receives the NOAA weather broadcasts to keep yourself regularly informed.   If you are staying in Oklahoma for a period of time, take note that the state does possess state-of-the-art radar and warning systems for tracking severe weather. These systems are, arguably, the best systems in the country. If you have access to a television or the internet then you will be able to readily obtain up-to-date weather information from these sources.  Refer to the  Tornado safety  page for more information regarding this matter.</field>

		<field name="content">The wildlife can also be somewhat hazardous, although with a bit of common sense, most danger can be avoided. This is bear country, so make noise if you are traveling in an area with limited visibility (most of this area has very poor visibility, due to the extreme amounts of vegetation.) Also, cougars do live in Olympic National park, and are much more aggressive and dangerous than bears. That being said, the number of incidents involving mountain lions is very small, so there isnt too much to worry about. Another animal that needs to be watched out for are the elk. Although elk are herd animals, and not aggressive like their moose cousins, they can be extremely dangerous if they feel threatened. Only an idiot would threaten a herd of 50 elk though, so if you are not an idiot, you will be safe from these animals. (And if you are an idiot, then you get to take part in one of the most ancient aspects of nature - natural selection.) Most people do not see bears or cougars, but you need to be prepared.  Though many of the animals in the park area are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed. Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals! Check trail head postings of recent animal activity.</field>

		<field name="content">Theres no reason to fear the mountains, as long as you approach them with proper respect and preparation. As with anywhere else, recklessness and a lack of forethought can get you into trouble, especially in Olympic National Parks vast back country.   Altitude sickness  - Can lead to dizziness, headaches, nausea, even blackouts and pulmonary edema. Give your body a few days to adjust to the high altitudes before going full throttle with your hiking or skiing.   Dehydration - When you engage in strenuous outdoor activities, be sure to replenish your fluids as you go. You may be losing moisture through your mouth and nose and through sweating, but be completely unaware due to the arid mountain air. May result in dizziness, intense thirst and elevated heart and breath rates.   Giardia - Drinking untreated water from regional streams is not a good idea owing to Giardia parasites, but tap water is not a problem.   Hypothermia - Prolonged exposure to the cold can result in confusion, a slowed heart rate, lethargy, even death. Dress warmly in non cotton clothing to allow any sweat to wick away from your body and evaporate. Otherwise, it may thoroughly chill you later in the day when temperatures drop.   Frostbite - During periods of severe cold, your circulatory system pulls all your warming blood into the core of your body to protect your vital organs. This makes your extremities such as your ears, fingers and nose especially vulnerable. Wear a face mask, insulated gloves and other heavy gear on the worst winter days. It gets cold sitting still on those ski lifts!  Sunburn - Lather up with sunscreen, even if theres cloud cover. The Olympics high mountain elevations means you have less protection to the suns powerful ultra violet rays.  The rays are reflected off the snow and hits the underside of your jaw. Dont forget to wear UV-rated goggles or sunglasses, as well. Know your 10 essentials when going on a hike, because cell phones wont always work in many rural areas, and may not be depended on in an emergency situation. 1.      Navigation 2.

You will need to pack everything with you when you go in, and pack almost everything as you go out. Basic backpacking rules must be followed by the parks rules.  Bring tidal information with you, many beaches are unpassable during high tides and hikers have been known to be caught off guard.   Do not camp within the range of the high tide, besides getting wet, ocean debris might wash up on beaches and could crush tents during the night.</field>

		<field name="content">Oregonians are known for being exceptionally kind and welcoming people; accordingly, violent crime in Oregon is quite low and visitors are not likely to have any harm come to them during their stay. Be aware, however, that violence has been on the rise in the  Portland  and  Salem  areas due to increasing gang activity - troubles which have likely been exacerbated by the states 10.5% unemployment rate (November, 2009). Property crime is always a problem. The most dangerous neighborhood in the entire state is probably the King neighborhood in Northeast Portland (and even this area is not too risky if traveling in a group at night). The Rockwood district in suburban  Gresham  is also known for disturbingly high levels of violent and property crime. A casual visitor, however, will not likely have any reason to go to either of these places - in fact, most residents dont, either. For hazards specific to these cities, please see their respective guides.  If you are in need of emergency assistance, dial 911 on your phone.</field>

		<field name="name">drugs</field>
		<field name="content">Marijuana is decriminalized in Oregon. Possession of a user-quantity (1 oz. or less) is a civil violation and can be punished by a fine of $500-$1,000. The level of enforcement will vary greatly depending on where you are: in  Portland  (Potland?) the police will likely dump it on the ground and tell you to get lost; in  Eugene  they might smoke it with you; and in  Burns  youll likely face down a judge who isnt too keen on letting some "Godless stoner" off with anything less than the maximum fine. Dealing is, as one might expect, not tolerated as well and offenders can expect unpleasant ramifications in the form of a felony conviction; this is especially true within 1,000 feet of a school.  As for "hard drugs", youre better off avoiding them. Due to the states awful methamphetamine wave of the 1980s - 2000s, there is very little tolerance in this area and a number of tough laws passed in response to the epidemic will all but ensure that you will be involved with the legal system for a long time to come and at great expense. Another side effect of the states notorious methamphetamine problem is that any medication containing pseudoephedrine (e.g. Sudafed) is treated as a Class III Controlled Substance of the Controlled Substance Act and thus requires a prescription. This also means that one must prove that they have a prescription to be in possession of such medications, so if one is coming from out-of-state it is a good idea to leave it at home.  Psychoactive mushrooms grow naturally here and abundantly, but, of course, possession is illegal. Dont be stupid.</field>

		<field name="content">If you venture out of the Willamette Valley during your stay, be sure that your automobile is well fueled and in suitable condition: while  Portland  is modern and well-populated,  Eastern Oregon  includes some of the most sparsely populated areas in the United States.  Harney County  in the Southeast region of the state, for example, is slightly smaller than  Massachusetts  but is the home to only about 7,000 people. Breaking down out there will, in best case scenarios, make for a very long and annoying day; at worst, the consequences can be tragic. In rural areas, be aware that many seemingly passable roads are truly impassable for large portions of fall, winter and spring.  Apparent routes or shortcuts across mountainous areas and deserts should be validated with locals before attempting - deep snow has captured the vehicle of many a tourist or day tripper who ventured into unknown territory and pushed when they should have exercised better judgment.  This also applies to routes between the Oregon coast (US Hwy 101) and the I-5 freeway. Always plan in advance, with one alternative in case of closure. In no case should this be left to chance or your GPS. There are many potentially dangerous roads through the Coastal Mountain Ranges, especially in severe weather and for those travelling with a RV or trailer.    Finally, as the subject of the vast emptiness of Oregon has been broached, remember to always have an adequate map (Benchmark Maps makes an exceptionally good one), especially if traveling into the wilderness on foot: each year many hikers go missing and, sadly, some never return. Know where you are going, and make sure someone else does too.  Oregon State Police: +1 503 378-3720  Oregon State University offers a  Saferide Program  throughout the week.</field>

		<field name="content">While Royal Oaks downtown area is a very safe place, avoid walking into alleyways during the night time. Many strongarm robberies and rape attempts take place in the citys downtown alleyways. The sidewalks and streets of Downtown Royal Oak are otherwise safe to walk during the daytime and night.  Avoid walking in any neighborhoods near or around an industrial park, railroad or apartment complex at night. Drug dealers are often present in these types of neighborhood after dark. If you choose to walk through such neighborhoods after dark remember to wear neutral-colored clothing and avoid large groups of people.  In addition, try not to walk on the Eleven Mile corridor during the night-time outside of the Downtown area as it is where many robberies in the city take place.</field>

Even during the day time, car burglaries are common, especially when an open window is involved.  Take further precaution regarding your vehicle if you are the owner of a Chrysler vehicle. Chrysler and Dodge automobiles are often targeted for navigation systems and owners of such vehicles may fall victim much easier.</field>

		<field name="name">beach safety</field>
		<field name="content">Rip currents are notorious in San Diego for their strength and sudden appearance.  Do not go out in the water without lifeguard supervision or at night. At La Jolla Shores, rip currents can be so strong that people standing (not swimming) in waist-deep water have been pulled out over their heads -- sometimes with deadly results (especially for non-swimmers).  Except for sunbathing, avoid low tide like the plague at this beach. (This means the largest of the two daily tide cycles. Check newspaper weather page for Scripps Pier, or view the Weather Channel.)  All of the major beaches have lifeguards on duty in the summertime, with only the more popular beaches having lifeguards year round.  Many of the ocean cliffs are made of a compressed sandstone and are prone to collapse, even in dry weather. If walking along the cliffs at the beach, try to be as far away from them as is practical. Obey all signs.  Heavy rain may cause rising bacteria and chemical levels in the ocean waters. Care should be taken to read the newspapers or call the county health office to see if the water is safe for swimming. Generally, most people stay out of the water at the beaches for 24 to 72 hours after rain.  Access to the beaches is safely made by using any of the public stairways provided; they are well maintained (except at Blacks Beach) and free.  The stairs at Blacks Beach are in disrepair, so use at ones own risk. Wear sturdy shoes, and dont try unless you are in very good physical condition and able to climb the 300 ft. (100m) back from the beach. Beware of the false trails going down the cliffs, as every year a few people get stuck (or worse!). The trailhead begins at the southern corner of the unpaved glider port parking lot. Take a little time to familiarize yourself with the area and observe where others are going. Though a long walk, you can also get in from the north via Torrey Pines State Beach. (Parking $8 in the lot or free along the highway.) High tide will cut off this route, so plan ahead.    The bridge that connects Torrey Pines (north of Blacks Beach) with  Del Mar  (former Hwy US 101) is old and in need of repair. Avoid walking directly underneath, as pieces of concrete occasionally fall off.  Its still considered safe enough to drive over for now.  If concerned, access this area from the south via I-5 and Genesee Avenue (exit 29) which soon becomes N. Torrey Pines Rd. Always supervise children very closely at places such as Sunset Cliffs and the Torrey Pines Glider Port above Blacks Beach.  It may be necessary to hold their hand at all times. If you have unruly kids, dont go there.  Thefts do occur at the beach and can ruin a perfectly wonderful day. Do not leave any purses or other personal items of value alone on the beach or in an open car. Vehicle burglaries are more prevalent in most beach communities and take place in broad daylight.  If possible, do not leave anything of value in your car even when locked. Most kayak and beach rental shops offer safe boxes free of charge, and will store your valuables while renting.   In addition, take caution when around certain beach areas, as you may wander (inadvertently) onto a military instillation, where security is tight and beaches are either reserved for military patrons and their families or training centers.  Also note that as of November 2009, a temporary ban of alcohol on all public beaches and coastal parks in the city of San Diego was made permanent by San Diego voters. Violators can be given up to a $250 fine, with repeat offenders fined up to $1,000 and six months in jail. The alcohol ban applies also to any sidewalk or street in the city of San Diego.</field>

		<field name="content">Though many of the animals in the Puget Sound area are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed. Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals! Check trail head postings at parks for recent activity and be aware of rules keeping a distance from Orca Whales and other marine animals while boating.  Regulations for killer whales require that boaters stay 200 yards away keep path of the whales clear.  These new U.S. regulations apply to all vessels (with some exceptions) in inland waters of Washington.  Dont disturb resting seal pups, keep children and dogs away and report to the local stranding hotline.  Report harassment or sightings of injured/stranded marine mammals by calling the NOAA Fisheries hotline at (800) 853-1964.  Seal pups haul out to get much needed rest when they are young and are often alone for many hours.  They are extremely vulnerable at this time and should be left alone.  Only about 50% of Puget Sound seal pups make it through their first year so please help to protect their health.  NOAA recommends at least a 100 yard buffer around seals.</field>

Due to their close proximity to Canada it is possible to get a better signal from a Canadian cell phone provider and depending on your phones settings could add foreign roaming charges to your bill.  Check your phones settings before using and be wary of your cell phone providers roaming charges.  Many of the islands are remote enough that cell phones simply wont work so dont plan on being dependent on them especially in the outer islands.</field>

		<field name="name">wildlife</field>
		<field name="content">Do not feed or touch any of the wildlife as there is the possibility of acquiring the plague from fleas that live on the animals.  Be aware of rattlesnakes and always check where you are stepping.  Cougars (or "mountain lions") also inhabit the park, but are rarely seen.  They look like light brown house cats, but 5–8 feet long (including the tail).  In the unlikely event that you run into one, dont approach it, and dont run.  A cougar expects prey to flee and will react appropriately.  Pick up any small children or pets.  Make eye contact, spread your arms to make yourself look bigger, and back away slowly.  If it approaches you, make noise and throw things at it; let it know that youre dangerous too.  If it attacks, dont curl up defensively... fight back.  The park is prime habitat for black bears and it is very likely that you will see one.  Stay a safe distance from bears and be careful never to come between a mother bear and her cub.  Never leave food in your vehicle or unattended at a camp site.  Bear proof containers are provided for food storage at camp sites and trail heads.  Safely storing food is required by park regulations and is essential for your own safety and also for the ultimate well-being of the bears. You can find more information on bears in the park, how to deal with a bear-human encounter, and park regulations about bears at the National Park Service web site.     Ticks are prevalent in the park and may carry Lyme disease.  To avoid tick bites, tuck pants legs into socks and tuck shirts into your pants.  If you do find an attached tick, remove it carefully with tweezers and seek medical advice from a ranger or a doctor.  If bringing your dog along, make sure to check the dog for ticks after your visit as well.</field>

		<field name="name">natural hazards</field>
		<field name="content">Poison oak is also present at elevations up to 5000 feet (1,500 m) in the park.  It causes itching, burning rashes in the affected areas and is easily spread.  Most trailheads have a bulletin board with a picture of poison oak.  If you come in conatact with poison oak, wash your clothes and the affected areas immediately.  A product named Technu (found in camping stores and drugstores) is good for neutralizing the toxic oils from the plant.  Avoid contact with your eyes.  Water from natural sources should be treated or boiled before drinking as it may contain giardia, a protozoa that causes intestinal illness.  Lightning can be a great hazard, especially on rock outcrops, on ridges or in meadows.  If a storm approaches, try to get indoors or inside a vehicle.  Do not stand under trees or in shallow caves.</field>

		<field name="content">Part of the state lies in the countrys "tornado alley", and its geographical location makes it prone to very violent thunderstorms during the spring and summer seasons. These thunderstorms, most often, will produce hail squalls and damaging winds. On occasion, they have also been known to spawn small scale tornadoes. Despite this being a rarity, and their small scale, they can still cause significant damage and endanger an unprepared traveler.   Travelers to and through the state, particularly its southern-most regions, during the spring/summer seasons should pay attention to weather conditions because they have the tendency to change very rapidly.

		<field name="content">Wild animals are called that for a reason, and South Dakota residents all know at least one story of a person being attacked because they ignored repeated warnings about getting too close. While centered mostly around the southwest part of the state, Bison are best viewed from the car or from a distance mdash; do not approach them. They look slow, but they can cover a good distance in short time.  Prairie dogs may be cute and fun to watch, but dont let your kids try to pet them. They will bite.  Also, mosquitoes in South Dakota are simply out of control. They bite through clothes and mark their territory on skin, a few inches of diameter at a time. Mosquito bites acquired in South Dakota remain red and swollen for a few days. It is crucial, although practically impossible, that you refrain from scratching them. If you feel you absolutely must do so, however, opt for alcohol on a piece of cotton applied to your war wounds before giving in to temptation, as doing so might alleviate the agitation and leave you with a somewhat cool sensation on your skin. Do not take a walk in the park without having sprayed some kind of mosquito repellent, or you will regret it as much as youd regret feeding your cat red jelly-beans on its third day straight of diarrhea.</field>

		<field name="content">During the spring months, the state is often heavily affected by major rain storms which lead to a risk of major flood potential. These floods are by NO MEANS on a small scale; they are often widespread and last for several days or even weeks. In May of 2010, the state experienced a "1000 year flood" which resulted in numerous fatalities and over $2 billion of property damage statewide.   Travelers to the region during this season should consider planning ahead; stay informed about weather events in the region before making your journey. If there is an eminent flood warning or an ongoing threat of a flood occurring in the area at which you plan to travel to or through, consider deferring your travel plans or take an alternate route to your final destination. Avoid flood ravaged areas, as these areas are unsafe for any non-essential travel.</field>

		<field name="content">Although it is not anywhere near the official "tornado alley", the state (particularly its central and western regions) does experience very violent thunderstorms during the spring and summer months of the year. These thunderstorms frequently have the potential to spawn small scale tornadoes, but this is not to say that the potential for larger scale events is not possible. During the April 2009 tornado outbreak, the city of Murfreesboro was struck by a very intense EF-4 tornado which resulted in 2 deaths and caused $40 million in property damage.   Therefore, any travelers to this region during these months should be vigilant of the changing weather conditions.   Refer to the  Tornado safety  page for more details regarding this matter.</field>

		<field name="content">The crime rate in Texas is relatively low. In the larger cities, if you stay in the tourist areas you will be generally safe (talk to your hotel concierge or manager if you arent sure about a certain area). The rural areas have a very low crime rate. Texans have a reputation for carrying firearms or resolving disputes with gunfire, but such actions are not significantly more common here than in other parts of the US. Concerns about crime spilling over from Juarez across the border into El Paso is unjustified, as El Paso remains a very safe city. Of course, Juarez sadly remains a very unsafe city, and El Pasoans will very strongly advise that you do not cross the bridges.  Law enforcement is provided statewide. All major cities and almost all towns have a police department, and all counties maintain a sheriffs office. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state agencies may be more understaffed and spread out. This is especially true in West Texas, where many towns are too small to operate police departments, and county sheriffs offices may be poorly manned and spread out over enormous land areas. Just as in the rest of the United States, the number "911" should be called in the event of an emergency.  Policing on the state level is generally provided by the Texas Highway Patrol. This agency mainly enforces state traffic laws, but also provides more localized law enforcement services in areas like West Texas. The Texas Highway Patrol has an outstanding reputation in the United States for being extremely courteous and professional. Officers of this agency (called "troopers") can be easily recognized by their characteristic tan uniform and matching cowboy hat. The Texas Rangers, despite being internationally known and storied, are unlikely to be seen by the public and are not prominent in everyday police work.  Despite stories of extremely harsh and brutal justice in Texas, law is executed in the Lone Star State in just as fair a manner as in any of the other forty-nine states.</field>

		<field name="content">Texas is generally safe for gays and lesbians, as the laws against homosexuality were struck down by the Supreme Court (via the Lawrence v. Texas court case in 2003).  Some Texans do hold some negative views towards public displays of homosexuality, but this varies by where one travels, with homophobic views usually being found in the more rural parts of Texas.  Regardless, violence against gays is very rare. The metro areas of Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio contain large gay scenes (Houston elected an openly gay mayor in 2009), and attitudes towards homosexuals are more accepting in those cities than in any other parts of the state.</field>

		<field name="content">The startling heat of a Texas summer is not to be underestimated. The state has experienced temperatures as high as 120ºF (49ºC), and though this extreme is rare, it is a good indicator of how hot things can get. Areas from north central Texas down to the coast also tend to experience stifling humidity during the spring and summer months, so pack accordingly with plenty of loose, light colored clothing.   Western portions of the state tend to experience higher temperatures and lower humidity. It is true that the Texas deserts are beautiful, but the heat can be dangerous without the proper precautions. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen. If you are venturing off into the desert, it might be best to do so later in the afternoon once the sun has begun to lower in the sky. Do not go alone, and always let someone else know where you will be going and when you should return. Follow desert survival guidelines.</field>

Always maintain a vigilance of any severe weather threats while traveling through or to these regions of the state during the spring and summer months. Dangerous weather conditions can arise suddenly, and if a traveler is unprepared, dire consequences may be the result. Tornadoes in this region can be exceptionally large and deadly. If there is an eminent threat of such weather, do not stay outside to take pictures. Do not try to outrun a tornado in your vehicle. Seek immediate shelter!

		<field name="content">Headline-grabbing major crimes and slightly unfavorable statistics give the United States a reputation for crime. However, few visitors experience any problems; common-sense precautions and staying alert are sufficient to avoid trouble. Crime is usually connected with gangs and drugs in the inner cities, and with heated disputes. Avoid those and youll be fine. Urban tourist areas are heavily policed and are safe from all but petty crimes.  Urban areas tend to have homeless people who may aggressively ask for money. If you feel harassed, say "No" firmly and walk away.  Illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and the authorities heavy-handed treatment of them, make the Mexican border undesirable to visit. Official border crossings are safe to use.</field>

		<field name="name">police</field>
		<field name="content">American police are generally polite, professional, and honest. When in uniform, they are also more formal, cautious, and cold than police in, say, Latin America—especially in large cities. If stopped by traffic police, you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, avoid making sudden movements, and state what you are doing if you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification. Turn on the inside car lights and keep your hands on the wheel to make it clear that you are not a threat; do not exit the vehicle unless told to do so.  Do not offer bribes to a police officer in any way or under any circumstances. U.S. police culture categorically rejects bribes, and the mere suggestion would very likely result in your immediate arrest. If you need to pay a fine, dont try to pay the officer; he or she can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Increasingly fines can be paid online or over the phone within a matter of minutes of receiving the ticket, though often for a convenience fee of a few dollars. Instructions are often printed on the ticket.  There are three types of police you are most likely to encounter: state police/highway patrol units on state highways, deputy sheriffs employed by county governments in rural areas, and police officers employed by city or town governments in urban areas.  Some transit agencies in major cities have their own transit police departments separate from city or county law enforcement.  Federal law enforcement officers are generally found only in or near federal facilities, such as ports of entry.  If you encounter them elsewhere, it is usually because they are investigating specific allegations of federal crimes.</field>

		<field name="content">Dialing 911 at any telephone will reach the emergency services (police, fire, ambulance, etc.). Any U.S. phone, regardless if it is "active" or not, must be able to dial 911 if it is connected to the network, and such calls are always free. Unless you are calling from a mobile phone, the operator should be able to locate you from the phone you are using even if you do not say anything on the phone.  Modern cell phones will send a GPS fix of your location down to a few meters within a few seconds of dialing 911. Dialing 911 and leaving an open line will bring all 3 emergency services to your location in under 5 minutes in most populated areas. Response time may be longer in sparsely populated areas or along the interstates.  On any GSM mobile phone (the standard technology in most of the world, especially in Europe), you can also dial 112, which is the standard emergency number for GSM networks worldwide. U.S. GSM carriers (ATT, T-Mobile, and smaller regional operators) automatically redirect 112 calls to 911.  As in most countries, misuse of the emergency services number will result in, at the least, a call back from authorities; at most, arrest.</field>

		<field name="name">border patrol</field>
		<field name="content">The United States Border Patrol works near both the Canadian and the Mexican borders, as well as in Southern coastal areas like the  Florida Keys . They can verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in the "border zones"—generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including sea). Near Canada they tend to be unobtrusive and generally focus their work on long-distance buses and trains. In the South, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being stopped on the street with a friendly "Papers, please..." is much more likely. They tend not to target tourists specifically.  Foreigners are always required to carry their passports, visas, and landing cards (or Green Cards). Being found without them near the border could lead you to being detained until your status is verified, or possibly fined. If your documents are in order, you generally wont be questioned. In most states ( Arizona  is a notable exception), police and other local authorities are not allowed to question you about your immigration status or to ask to see your passport or visa unless youre arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with your embassy.</field>

		<field name="name">natural disasters</field>
		<field name="content">The U.S. is a huge country with very varied geography, and parts of it are occasionally affected by natural disasters: hurricanes and tropical storms from June through November in the  South  (including  Florida ), blizzards (a specific and common type are "Noreasters") in  New England  and the areas near the Great Lakes and the  Rocky Mountains , tornadoes mostly in the  Great Plains  and  Midwest , earthquakes in  California  and  Alaska , floods in areas of the  Midwest  and wildfires in the late summer and early fall in  Texas  and on the West Coast, particularly  California . See the regions in question for more details.  Because tornadoes are so common between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, this area has earned itself the colloquial name Tornado Alley. The San Andreas Fault is a tectonic plate boundary running through California, an area prone to earthquakes.  In the case of a natural disaster, local, state or federal authorities can issue a warning over the Emergency Alert System. It has a very distinctive electronic screeching followed by a sound similar to a dial tone prior to any message. It will override AM/FM radio broadcasts as well as TV systems. Smartphones sold since about 2011 will often receive the alert as well in the form of a message based on the current location of the phone (depending on the phones settings, this may include a loud alert tone). In most tornado-prone regions, a system of sirens will sound when a tornado warning is issued. If you hear the siren, seek shelter immediately. (For more information, see  tornado safety .)</field>

		<field name="name">gay and lesbian</field>
		<field name="content">Homosexual relations are legal. Many states and cities (even those considered to be more conservative or that do not recognize same-sex marriage) have anti-discrimination codes protecting sexual orientation, including public accommodations in hotels, restaurants and transport.  The major legal controversy concerns whether same-sex marriage should be recognized or not. Marriage laws vary from state to state; currently 13 states and the District of Columbia allow and recognize same-sex marriages, while a handful others provide some benefits without calling them "marriages".  In these states, foreign marriages will likely be recognized.  The federal government, due to a recent court case, now also recognizes same-sex marriages; in theory, this includes foreign marriages, but the precise details are not yet clear.  In general, the US is a safe destination for gay and lesbian travellers, though as a whole, homosexuality is somewhat not as well accepted as in Australia, Canada or Western Europe. Most Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are significant exceptions. Its generally not a problem to be open about your sexual orientation, though you may receive unwanted attention or remarks in some situations. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely even in regions with a reputation for tolerance or intolerance. Acceptance is most common in major cities throughout the country and smaller cities, suburbs and college towns especially around the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and Hawaii, with acceptance in these areas generally being on par with Western Europe. Homophobia and anti-gay violence may be encountered anywhere, especially in some suburban and rural areas of the Southeast and interior West, but the chances of this happening to you are low.  Gay-friendly destinations, where openly gay couples are common, include  New York s  Chelsea ,  Rochester  in Western  New York State ,  Chicago s  Boystown ,  Seattle s  Capitol Hill ,  San Francisco s  Castro Street ,  Washington s  Dupont Circle ,  Miami Beach s  South Beach ,  Atlanta s  Midtown  and  Los Angeles   West Hollywood . Even outside of gay neighborhoods, many major cities are gay-friendly, especially in the Northeast and the West Coast. An increasing number of resort areas are known as gay-friendly, including  Fire Island ,  Key West ,  Asheville ,  Provincetown ,  Ogunquit ,  Rehoboth Beach ,  Saugatuck , and parts of  Asbury Park . In other smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate, many have resource centers for LGBT people.  Some businesses specifically advertise that they are LGBT-friendly by displaying symbols (typically a rainbow flag) on their storefront.  Men planning to engage in any sexual activity should be aware of the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are infected with HIV, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including safer sex, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs, though hours may be limited and waits may be long.  Planned Parenthood  clinics are often an affordable alternative. The lifelong repercussions of HIV or other STIs arent covered by many insurance policies. Seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey, as the U.S. medical system is private and largely operates on a for-profit basis.</field>

		<field name="content">In general U.S. drug laws can be pretty severe—even possession or transportation of small amounts can lead to prison or deportation and should be avoided by travelers. However laws and attitudes concerning the most commonly available drug—marijuana—vary wildly from state to state.  States like Louisiana and Florida impose large fines and lengthy prison sentences, while in other states marijuana use has been largely decriminalized. 18 states currently allow medical use of marijuana, where persons can obtain marijuana for medicinal use with a doctors prescription and a "medical marijuana card".  Colorado  and  Washington state  allow limited recreational use of marijuana. Under no circumstances should you transport marijuana or other drugs that are illegal under federal law across state lines, as doing so is drug trafficking and could subject you to a lengthy prison term.</field>

		<field name="content">Its true: many—but by no means all—Americans own a firearm. Possession of firearms is regulated by individual states and these regulations (obtaining necessary permits, the kinds of arms permitted) vary greatly from state to state and, sometimes, from city to city within the same state.  Non-immigrant aliens present in America for fewer than 180 days cannot possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they traveled specifically for hunting or sporting shooting, or they have a valid hunting license from the state they are shooting in. Entry in a recognized shooting competition also qualifies. Anything else is strictly illegal.  Your chances of getting shot are very low, but bear in mind that:   In a city, a civilian with an openly visible firearm is much more of a concern than one in the country. However, many states permit "open carry", and while uncommon in cities, you may encounter somebody with a holstered firearm. Many states also have "concealed carry", laws which permit the possession of a concealed firearm in clothing or in a vehicle.   Hunting is popular in rural America. Use of marked trails should not be a risk, but if venturing off the beaten path try to inquire if and where any hunting may currently be afoot. If there is, wear bright colors (particularly "Blaze Orange") to be highly visible to the hunters. This includes putting a bright vest on any dogs you take too. If you wish to hunt, obtain the correct permits and review the local regulations.   Target shooting is a popular sport. Many ranges welcome tourists and will have a variety of firearms available to rent and shoot at the range. Many implement a "two person minimum" rule and consider it unsafe to rent firearms to lone individuals.</field>

		<field name="content">Weapons of all sorts are prohibited in the parks; if you are carrying in a bag or backpack, a security officer will check its contents before you enter.  While theft is rare and security is always present throughout the resort, its still a good idea to keep valuables locked in the electronic safe in your hotel room. Avoid bringing unnecessary items with you, and if you must, rent a locker and store them locked inside during your visit.  Keep your eye on your belongings at all times. Do not display cash in public. Consider wearing a money belt. Do not leave anything in an unattended stroller or wheelchair, especially when you go on a ride. If possible, leave loose articles with a non-rider.  Children are very safe at Walt Disney World, but its not uncommon for parents and children to get separated due to the crowds.  One suggestion is to write down your childs name with your name, resort, cell phone number, and any vital medical information on a 3x5 index card.  Place the card in your childs pocket and instruct him/her to show the card to any Cast Member in the event that you get separated. Likewise, if you lose your child, notify a Cast Member immediately.  They are all well trained and will get you reunited as quickly as possible.  If your child goes on a ride on his/her own, make sure you know where the rides exit is.  Arrange a place to meet with all members of your party if you become separated.  Make the meeting place easy to find, but out of the way; areas such as in front of Cinderella Castle or the front of the park are likely to be too crowded to be useful.  Some families also wear matching T-shirts with very bright, bold colors, making it less difficult to spot a member of your party in a sea of people.</field>

A car with a pet locked inside will be broken into to remove the pet, and WDW will not be held liable for any damages incurred.  Service animals may not be accommodated on some attractions.

		<field name="name">weather</field>
		<field name="content">Especially during the spring and summer, heat is the most likely weather-related issue youll encounter.  To cope:  Wear a light-colored shirt during the summer. White and light colors reflect sunlight better than darker colors, so you wont get overheated as easily.  Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your head, face and eyes. Sunscreen may be purchased at most gift shops, but are often sold exorbitantly overpriced, so it may be easier on your wallet to bring your own.  Drink lots of water. You can easily become dehydrated in the heat. Stay clear of carbonated drinks, tea and coffee. Dehydration can lead to weakness, fatigue, and eventually heat stroke due to the bodys reduced ability to regulate its temperature.  Go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool to cool you off. Or cool off in the one of the many interactive fountains that can be found in the parks. (Dont forget to take spare clothing with you!) Another good idea would be to visit Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon in the morning, then head to the theme parks afterwards; this will give your body adequate hydration to better withstand the heat.  Go indoors, into an air-conditioned shop or attraction.  Try to do the outdoor attractions in the morning, and save the indoor attractions and shows until the afternoon when its hotter.  Remember that even on cool days, the Florida sun can burn.  Visitors from northern latitudes often dont realize that the suns angle in Florida is going to be higher than back home, and that means a greater likelihood of sunburn... even if the temperature is in the 50s or 60s Fahrenheit (10-20 °C).  Wear sunscreen!  If your trip is in the late summer or early fall, youll soon learn about the daily afternoon thundershowers.  They are usually brief and wont ruin your whole day.  If you want to stay dry, rain ponchos and umbrellas are sold throughout the parks.  Walt Disney World does not close down due to rain, though some outdoor rides and attractions may temporarily do so.  Hurricanes are a different story.  The Orlando area is as far from the coasts as anyplace in the state, so hurricane-related closures are very rare.  If the parks do end up closed for high winds, though, your resort hotel will make sure you stay entertained, sometimes with special appearances from the Disney characters. The hotels are perfectly safe in high winds.</field>

Certain areas of Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, and Yakima can become seedy after dark and it is therefore advised that one avoid being out alone very late at night; this is especially true in unlit places where you are an easy target for any crime or other illegal activity.   Always be confident, or at least fake confidence. Obviously, pick pockets and such tend to target people who look vulnerable. Avoid wearing excessive amounts of jewelry and other expensive items which might catch a robbers eye. Be sure to secure personal belongings where they will not be tampered with or stolen. Property crime is the largest threat in the state to a tourist.  If you find yourself in an emergency situation (of any kind), dial 911 on your phone.</field>

		<field name="content">the Columbia River flows through central Washington before defining Washingtons southern border.  East of the Cascade Mountains, the states terrain begins to turn into desert and temperatures often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit in regions such as the Yakima Valley and the Columbia River Plateau. If are planning on hiking into these locations, follow desert survival guidelines. Be sure to take plenty of water (at least one gallon per person, per day), sunscreen and wear light clothing. Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to get return.   Also, it is best to hike during the earlier part of the day, as thunderstorms tend to develop suddenly during the afternoon. In the event you encounter inclement weather conditions, seek high ground immediately! Thunderstorms can cause flash flooding in canyons and other low laying areas.</field>

		<field name="content">Washington is the first state to legalize marijuana.  Adults 21 years or older may possess up to "one ounce of useable marijuana", 16 ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form or "any combination" of all three.  But this does not give permission for people to simply smoke in public.  There are a few scattered clubs in the state that are currently allowing public smoking and medical marijuana shops are prolific however the Washington state legislature is still working out the details and taxation so it is not widely available yet.  Hempfest is an annual summer rally in Seattle, it is the largest pro marijuana rally in the world.  Under no circumstances should you transport marijuana or other drugs that are illegal under federal law across state lines, as doing so is drug trafficking and could subject you to a lengthy prison term.  The drinking age in Washington is 21 years old.  This goes for buying alcohol as well.</field>

Be especially alert when driving. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible landslides or debris flows.   If you encounter a landslide, LEAVE the area immediately if it is safe to do so and call the local fire, police or public works department.</field>

		<field name="content">Volcano safety is, to put it mildly, a controversial subject; see the article on  Volcanoes  (and, particularly, its discussion page) for some of the issues. Washington state is home to five major, active volcanoes, plus one just across the border in Oregon:  Mount St. Helens  (1980),  Mount Rainier  (1894),  Mount Baker  (1880),  Mount Hood , Oregon (1866),  Glacier Peak  (c. 1700), and  Mount Adams  (c. 550 B.C.). The majority of these are considered to be tourist destinations, particularly Rainier and St. Helens.   If planning to visit one of these locations, FOLLOW the policy regarding any road and/or trail closures that at first glance may appear unnecessarily conservative -- but it is not. Believe it. The closures arent there simply to inconvenience and irritate you. If a trail is closed due to eruptive hazard, stay off the trail.</field>

		<field name="content">The aptly named Deception Pass is a dramatic seascape where the tidal flow and whirlpools beneath the twin bridges connecting  Fidalgo Island  to Whidbey Island move quickly. During low tides, the swift current can lead to standing waves, large whirlpools, and roiling eddies. This swift current phenomenon can be viewed from the twin bridges pedestrian walkways or from the trail leading below the larger south bridge from the parking lot on the Whidbey Island side. Boats can be seen waiting on either side of the pass for the current to stop or change direction before going through. Thrill-seeking kayakers go there during large tide changes to surf the standing waves and brave the class 2 and 3 rapid conditions.  This area is for experienced boaters only.</field>

		<field name="name">crime</field>
		<field name="content">Due to several low-income neighborhoods located near the Front Street nightlife district and the fact that the nightlife attracts a hefty group of college students and US military personnel from nearby Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base, Wilmington does have a slightly higher crime rate than would be expected from a city of its size. When walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods/areas (particularly at night), exercise the standard level of awareness and caution and try to travel in groups. During late weekend nights, alcohol-fueled fights on Front Street are not unheard of. Typically this occurs around the time bars begin closing at 2:30-3:30 a.m. The police are typically on top of disturbances, however, and such fights serve more as a public nuisance than a threat to safety. The Front Street riverfront nightlife district typically has a considerable mounted police presence on busy nights able to handle any disruptions.  There are several neighborhoods that have reputations as crime spots, but these areas offer nothing of interest to the visitor and are best avoided altogether. Do not mistakenly, particularly at night, wander into low-income neighborhoods that border the riverfront/Front Street district. Violent crime has been known to happen in these areas.  Always be aware of your surroundings. Front Street is quite a busy area; if you find yourself suddenly in an area lacking in pedestrian traffic, there is probable a reason for it so immediately turn around.  A real-time map of reported crimes in Wilmington is available.</field>

		<field name="content">Yakima has experienced a significant increase in gang activity throughout the past decade due to its population growth. This has resulted in a rise of violent crime within the city limits, although incidents of violence are mostly isolated to particular neighborhoods (mostly on the east side).  During the late summer of 2010, the West Valley area of Yakima experienced a string of burglaries. Take precautions to protect your personal property.  In reality, Yakima is very nice place to visit and the surrounding scenery is just as wonderful as its sun abundant climate. The problems it does have are typical in most mid-size cities and rarely effect the average person.  The best way to stay safe is to just BE SMART. Be vigilant! Most often when people find themselves in a bad situation, it is because they put themselves in that situation. If you need help, there is a often visible police presence in the more troubled locales.</field>

		<field name="content">Though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed. Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals!  No matter how docile they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack, and every year dozens of visitors are injured because they didnt keep a proper distance.  These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.  In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean camp; do not cook or store food in your tent. All food, garbage, or other odorous items used for preparing or cooking food must be secured from bears. Treat all odorous products such as soap, deodorant, or other toiletries in the same manner as food. Do not leave packs containing food unattended, even for a few minutes. Animals which obtain human food often become aggressive and dependent on human foods, and many can suffer ill health or death from eating a non-native diet.  A short film about food safety is now mandatory before a back country permit will be issued.</field>

Every year visitors traveling off trail are seriously burned, and people have died from the scalding water. Park rangers can also issue $125 fines for being out of bounds. Note though, its common to get sprayed with fine mist from the geysers. You dont need to worry about being burned, as the water has traveled sufficient distance to cool down, provided youre within the designated areas. No swimming or bathing is allowed in thermal pools.</field>

		<field name="content">Over the years the parks bears have become accustomed to scavenging trash and food left out by humans, and will even break into cars and tents to get it.  While not the larger grizzly bears that once roamed California, black bears are strong enough to tear a door off of a car with ease.  Luckily they usually prefer to avoid humans, so theyll most likely do their work on vehicles left at trailheads or in parking lots. Prevention is remarkably simple: never leave food or scented items (deodorant, air fresheners) in your car or bring them into your tent.  Heed this advice!  Leaving even just a tube of toothpaste or empty food wrappers in a car may result in thousands of dollars of damage to your vehicle should a bear choose to investigate the smell!  Bear-resistant storage units are provided at park campgrounds and overnight parking areas:  use them.  To avoid bear encounters while hiking, make noise so that the animal knows you are coming.  This approach will also help to avoid encounters with mountain lions, which also inhabit the park.  Other animals, such as the herds of deer which can be found in the parks meadows, can be equally dangerous; a young boy was killed by a deer in Yosemite Valley several years ago.  Give all animals their space, and never feed any park wildlife.</field>

		<field name="content">Hikers should follow all posted signs - if a trail is closed due to ice, landslide, or some other reason do not ignore the closure as doing so endangers both the hiker and any area that must be traversed to go around the closure.  On the Half Dome trail hikers should ALWAYS remain inside the cables for both their ascent and descent - people have died on this section of trail as recently as Summer 2009.  The parks waterfalls pose another potential hazard.  Do not attempt to get close to the waterfalls, especially in the spring.  This includes swimming above the waterfalls at a distance of less than 1 mile (about 1600 meters) The force of the water will easily sweep a person off their feet and over the falls. Being swept over any of Yosemites waterfalls is invariably fatal.</field>

		<field name="content">Currently, the greatest danger in the park comes from the thousands of park visitors.  Petty thieves and traffic accidents are two issues to be aware of.  Follow park speed limits, lock your vehicle, and be aware of your belongings, especially in Yosemite Valley.  Violent crime is extremely rare in Yosemite, but given the numbers of people that visit you should expect that a few unsavory characters will be visiting too.  The National Park Service provides the primary law enforcement and fire protection in the park.  NPS is supplemented by DNC Security, who handle a number of calls for service on DNC land assignments.  DNC Fire is paged out along with NPS Fire, and handles a large number of calls in Yosemite Valley.    Lost and Found  There are two major Lost and Found operations in Yosemite.  One is run by the National Park Service.  It can be reached at 209-379-1001.  The other is run by DNC, and can be reached at: 209-372-4357.  They coordinate as best as possible, considering they are a half-hour away from each other.  They process thousands of items each year and surprisingly get a number of items back to the rightful owner.  Because of the thousands of items lost or found, generally, you will not get a return call unless your item has been found and turned in correctly.    Items that are found that cannot be returned to the owner are generally turned over to recognized charities.  So, if you dont get your item back, and if it is turned in by the finder, at least you can rest easy that it will eventually go to a good cause.</field>

		<field name="content">Sadly, Downtown is one of those parts of Baltimore that is not safe by any standards. Sandwiched between pleasant Midtown and the tourist hub of the Inner Harbor, housing the principal businesses in the city and a major university, this should not be the case, but its Baltimore, folks. Dont run in fear and cowardice—definitely check out Lexington Market, see Poes Grave, attend a performance at the Hippodrome, or a game at the Baltimore Arena, and bring your family, but be safe. Minimize walking, avoid lonely streets, and park in a well lit area, with no valuables (or really anything) visible.           wikipedia:Downtown Baltimore</field>

		<field name="content">If hiking, wear good boots and stay on the trail.  Dangerous wildlife encounters are rare, but rattlesnakes are found throughout the monument, particularly at dawn and dusk when the hunting is good, or in the middle of the day during the cooler parts of the year.  If theres a snake on the trail, just step back and concede it the right of way.  The possibility of surprising a snake concealed on a ledge is just one of the reasons to obey the prohibition against climbing the rock formations or getting off the trails.  If camping at Bonita Canyon, make sure to secure your food items overnight; there are bears in the monument, and the coatis can play the same camp-robber role as raccoons do farther north.  Its also wise to shake out your shoes and boots before putting them on in the morning, as they can make nice hiding places for critters such as scorpions.  Finally, remember to wear sun screen and take lots of water when you go hiking.</field>

Virtually every area of town is considered safe to walk, but caution should be taken walking at night in the area around the apartment complexes on Pujol Street near Old Town, and the area of the apartment complexes just east of the Rancho California/Ynez intersection across from the Temecula Town Center. Though still relatively safe, there has been an increase in gang activity and the usual related crimes: drugs, car thefts and assaults.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite its reputation for being crime-ridden, New York is statistically the safest large city in the United States, and its crime rate per person is lower than the national average and the crime rate of many small towns. An aggressive law enforcement policy, coupled with an increase in police presence during the 1990s under the leadership of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani, has resulted in a sharp reduction in the crime rate. You can also be assured of a high police presence in Times Square, public transportation hubs and other major crowded places. For the most part, the legendary subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are now a thing of the past, and it is generally safe to travel around at night in the subway as long as you use common sense and keep a moderate level of vigilance.  The most common crime against tourists (not including being overcharged!) is bag snatching. Never let go of your bag, especially in the subway but also when eating at a restaurant. Take special care if sitting outdoors or in a crowded self-service restaurant. Leave your passport and other valuables in a hotel safe or hidden in your suitcase, and dont flaunt a wad of money.   While muggings are rare, they do happen. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you find yourself on a lightly traveled or poorly lit street. Certain neighborhoods that are off the tourist path should be avoided in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Riverside Park and Central Park can be dangerous at night. If you go to an evening outdoor concert at one of the parks, follow the crowd out of the park before heading toward your destination.  In a post-9/11 New York, airport style security is becoming a common sight at a growing list of buildings, museums and tourist attractions, even the Public Library. Generally you can expect to have your bags checked (either manually by a security guard or through an x-ray machine) and walk through a metal detector. Unlike their counterparts at JFK and LaGuardia, security screenings at building entrances are surprisingly quick and efficient - and you can even leave your shoes on!  If you think youve inadvertently wandered into a dangerous area, hop into a cab, if available, or into the nearest subway station and go elsewhere. If a subway platform is deserted, stay within sight of the station agent if possible.   New York has its share of odd people: talkative pan-handlers, lonely people just wanting a chat, religious preachers, people with psychological disorders, etc. If you prefer not to speak with someone who approaches you for a chat, do what most New Yorkers do: completely ignore them or say "Sorry, gotta go" while continuing to walk at a brisk pace.   Despite the stereotypes, many New Yorkers are nice people and dont mind giving out directions (time allowing), so dont be afraid to ask! If you ever get into trouble, approach the nearest police officer. Youll find them to be friendly, polite, and very helpful.</field>

Bums will often hang out in the middle of the intersections.  Water currents can be a danger along any part of the island. Swimming near lifeguard stations and obeying safety signs may offer some assurance.  Straits have treacherous waters, largely due to murky water and fast moving currents: many drownings occur in the vicinity of the San Luis Pass compared to other areas off of nearby beaches. Water current dangers are more prominent up to about one mile away from island straits not protected by a jetty. Entering the water is not allowed in many of these areas.</field>

		<field name="content">San Rafaels crime rate would be considered moderately high.  Murder and gang violence has reached high levels and are increasing at disturbingly high rates, with stabings and/or shootings occurring every few weeks. The downtown area does have a higher amount of car break ins than one might expect.  If you decide to venture into the Canal District, stay alert, even in the daytime. The District is home to many first-generation immigrants who densely populate apartment buildings to offset the relatively high cost of living, and street gangs are relatively common. Try not to wear too much red- or blue-colored clothing—you may easily be confused as a rival to another gang and approached. It is best not to walk around the Canal District at night, even if traveling with someone else. The neighborhood has a fairly high amount of gang violence, robbery, and car theft. If driving through the Canal District, it is best to keep your windows rolled up and your doors locked at all times.Be sure that not all part of the Canal District is Dangerous(Novato street is the street with most gang members hangingout) On some streets of the Canal District you can literally see massive amounts of broken glass where car windows have been smashed. However, it is home to some of the best Latin food in the Bay Area.  (Note: As a resident of the canal district, I would love to see some hard numbers on the violence and property damage. It doesnt surprise me that cars are broken into in a poor neighborhood, but the danger of violence seems radically overstated. Its true that ethnic minorities abound, but that doesnt mean youll get ripped out of your car while youre driving—feel free to keep your windows rolled down until you park.)</field>

Denver does have a more visible population of homeless people, but the city has strict laws about accosting for money. In general, panhandlers dont harm anyone. Downtown has a fairly active 24/7 population, especially in LoDo, so its generally safe.  Still, it may be a good idea not to travel alone at night in some of the neighborhoods surrounding downtown. Although the inner-city neighborhoods are not as bad as those in some other cities, they have higher rates of crime than the rest of the city. The rest of Denver is safe, though.</field>

		<field name="content">Common sense rules about leaving valuables out-of-sight while your vehicle is unattended will help provide for a happier trip.  Violent crime is extremely rare, but sometimes occurs in and around the citys many taverns.  Keep in mind that the posted speed limits are strictly enforced, especially on the citys viaducts on Belknap and N. 21st streets.  Winter driving can be hazardous at times due to snowstorms, and strong northeasterly winds are common in the spring months, which can make travelling the bridges to Duluth an adventure.  Superior has removed crossing alerts at many of its railroad crossings in town (and there are many of them!), so use caution.</field>

The neighborhood of East Cambridge, which is near the  Charlestown  border and on the Charles River, usually has the citys highest crime rate (of course, this observation is relative to the Cambridges low crime rate overall).  As a rule, most crime in Cambridge that might affect a traveller is property crime.  Parked vehicles with electronic equipment visible — laptops, mobile phones, GPS units, iPods, and the like — are the most likely to be targeted.  Pepper spray is considered a weapon in Massachusetts, and is sold only by licensed dealers to persons who have obtained a firearms identification card.  Out-of-state visitors should be advised that Massachusetts does not honor firearms licenses from other states.  For more information, go to the Cambridge Police Departments website   .</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Nevadas rugged outdoors is a major draw to thousands of tourists each year.  Many venture into the State and National parks only an hours drive from major cities to find themselves at odds with the harshness of the environment.  The following suggestions are a starting point to those who wish to venture away from the city and experience the endless beauty that Nevada has to offer. No webpage can substitute for common sense, a minimal of preparations and knowing your own limits.  Many of the most scenic areas which can be reached by car are a LONG way from cell service, fueling locations or emergency services.  You need to be prepared for the trip so that fun does not turn into difficult circumstances.   Fill up your vehicles fuel tank before leaving the main cities.  Even while on the interstate, long stretches between fuel stations can strand a motorist with few options except to wait for someone to drive by.  On rural roads or two lane highways, this could be a long wait.  ALWAYS take extra water with you.  AT LEAST 2 liters of water per person for a short trip, 3-4 liters per person for an all day excursion.  Many locals in the region use inexpensive hydration packs, similar to a camels hump, which hold water for several hours of activity. The "CamelBak" is also a great place for your emergency blanket, map, first aid kit and snacks in case you are injured.  Always check the weather before you go. Weather can change quickly in Nevada. In summer during the North American Monsoon, powerful thunderstorms often build up near the crest of the Sierra Nevada, particularly during late afternoon. Soaring summer temperatures can quickly drop 20 - 30 degrees when the sun goes down. Even in the height of summer Rain or SNOW can occur when very cold air drops down off the Sierra Mountains.  It is unwise to be in a high, treeless place during a thunderstorm.  Always bring a jacket / sweatshirt / or other warm clothing in the car. A pocket sized "Emergency Blanket" made of silver foil will keep you warm and can also shade you from the sun if you are injured and must wait for rescue.  During winter you should always carry tire chains in your car and know how to use them when crossing The Sierra Nevada Range from California to Nevada. This is a high mountain environment containing some of the snowiest places in the US with unpredictable heavy snow coming in late summer/early fall.  Outdoor 10 Essentials If you decide to enjoy the great outdoors below is a suggested list of minimal equipment you should have if you leave sight of your car.  Entering the desert unprepared is trusting Lady Luck with more than just your money.  :Water                  Be SURE you always have a liter or two of water WITH YOU when you leave leave the car. :Energy Bar / snack     Great for on the trail, but also in case you get lost or injured. :Emergency Blanket      Silver Foil Blanket which keep you warm, and can shade you from the sun. :Pocket Knife           Generally Useful. :Eye drops!             Keep those Eyes Moist! :Cough Drops            Soothes a Parched Dry Throat :Bandaids / FirstAID    Nothing too fancy. Large Bandaids, medical tape, 4x4 gauze pads, cleaning pad. :Map/Compass or GPS device         You need a way to find you way back to your car.   :Flashlight             Small LED flashlight is fine, just in case it gets dark. :Whistle                When your throat is dry, you cant yell for help. This works. Many include a small compass / tube for supplies.</field>

The police can arrest you and charge you with public disorderly conduct if they believe this is the case, and there seems to be no legal definition of grossly intoxicated for a pedestrian. This is a misdemeanor offence, resulting in a court hearing. You can get your charged expunged within the state by entering a Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) program. This involves fines, community service, drug tests, attending alcoholic’s anonymous meetings homework assignments and typically takes about 2 months to complete. However, the PTI program is not recognized by the Federal Government.</field>

		<field name="content">Like most other cities, Rochester is generally safe but there are areas that are more prone to crime than others.  Potentially dangerous areas exist in the northeast and southwest city neighborhoods.  However, there is nothing in these neighborhoods of any particular interest to non-residents so it is unlikely that the average visitor would encounter these areas. Use common sense and situational awareness and crime will not be a problem.  The suburban areas of Rochester generally enjoy a low crime rate.  The US Border Patrol has a significant presence in Rochester (arguably moreso than  Buffalo , which is physically located on the US-Canadian border) and regularly patrol public transit and long distance buses and trains. Persons approached by an officer will be asked their country of citizenship and if not a US Citizen, for their passport, I-94 card or visa (if applicable.) Having these documents handy will prevent delays, see  United States of AmericaBorder Patrol .  The presence of the University of Rochester Medical Center means the Rochester area enjoys access to very high-quality health care.  If you need medical assistance, there are several local hospitals:          The region also has several urgent care facilities, open during business hours, that can handle minor medical needs to relieve pressure on the hospital emergency rooms.  Call 911 in case of emergency.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">St. Louis recent designation as the Most Dangerous City in America should not deter the potential visitor -- vagaries in data collection and the citys fixed borders distort the true nature of the Gateway Citys safety. Areas most often visited by tourists are no more dangerous than any other large American city. The more popular and most-visited areas in the city, such as Clayton, Downtown, the Central West End, and Forest Park have very low crime rates, even for the Midwest.  Some economically depressed North County suburbs like Wellston, Pagedale and parts of Normandy and Jennings, as well as many parts of North Saint Louis city are unsafe. The post-war exodus to the suburbs has taken a huge economic toll on these areas, leaving many buildings abandoned, decaying, or demolished. East St. Louis, in Illinois, is also noted for its high crime rate (note this is not true of Alton or Belleville, in Illinois to the north and south). When in the city, a general guideline (though politically incorrect and somewhat simplistic) is that areas north of Delmar Blvd are less safe than south. Most tourists, however, will have little reason to visit any of these places, so it should not present reason for much concern.  Some Metrolink stations are located in areas some may find questionable after dark as well. But most downtown areas around Busch Stadium, and Union Station, as well as the St. Louis University area and commuter lots near the airport, are generally safe and patrolled.   Although the chance is extremely rare, an earthquake is possible in the area, as St. Louis sits on a fault line, whose last big earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River. While many scientists have cautioned that a "big one" may occur again, the majority agree it is unlikely to happen any time soon.  St. Louis has had more urban tornadoes than any other city in the country, so make sure you understand tornado safety precautions.</field>

		<field name="content">By far, the greatest danger in this park is the weather.  Due to the high desert environment, it will be blazing hot during the day and temperatures may drop to freezing during the night.  Do not hike without adequate water.  One gallon per person per day is the minimum recommended amount.  Wear sunscreen, dress in layers, and take all other precautions when dealing with a desert environment.  Be aware that even a tiny amount of rain can cause flash flooding; avoid canyons and drainage areas during severe weather.  Other dangers within the park include rattlesnakes, abandoned mines, and the numerous prickly and thorny desert plants.  In general, snakes can be avoided by being careful when in rocky areas.  Mines can be found throughout the park, and while most have been sealed over, open mines can still be found.  Do not enter mines - most of these areas are over 100 years old and are extremely dangerous.</field>

		<field name="content">There are few dangers in the park.  The most common is likely due to weather; the trail up to the cave is steep and in the summer can be very warm, so bring liquids.  The cave, however, is a constant 45 °F, so a jacket is a necessity.  In addition, beware of areas along the trail marked in red in which rockfalls are common.  When hiking through these areas be alert and do not stop.  When inside of the caves be cautious of your surroundings as it is all-too-easy to bang your head on a rock formation.  Rattlesnakes and other wild animals pose a minor danger, but commonsense precautions will help to avoid encounters: stay on the trail, and dont feed wild animals as doing so is bad for their health and may cause them to become aggressive.</field>

		<field name="title">San Francisco</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">As with many other major cities in the world, San Francisco has its share of problems. A search for "People Behaving Badly" on YouTube will reveal local KRON 4 reporter Stanley Roberts varied and sometimes comical segments on aggressive panhandling, distracted drivers, fare evasion, and most famously "Elmo Shirt Guy" who became an internet-meme in his own right and was featured on Jimmy Kimmel. The good news is that as a visitor to San Francisco, though you may occasionally encounter people behaving badly, with a dash of common sense its unlikely youll be the target of any crime or violence.  The areas that one should be most cautious are in the neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, Sunnydale, Ingleside, and Potrero Hill in  Southeast  San Francisco, as well as the  Tenderloin , parts of  Western Addition  (including the Fillmore District), and parts of the  Mission . San Francisco is still susceptible to violent crime, and most of these murders occur in the southeast, less economically fortunate, neighborhoods of the city. Gang violence touches even busy and thriving areas such as the Mission Street retail corridor, although most instances of violent crime are directed to specific targets and are not random acts. The  SoMa  district used to be somewhat dangerous; however, recent gentrification (something that has become fairly common and a social issue in SF) has transformed it into a rather hip and much safer neighborhood with plenty of art galleries and clubs. However, it is best to be careful even now.  San Francisco also has the largest homeless population per capita in the United States. If someone begs from you, you may either politely say you do not have any change or just keep walking, and he or she will generally leave you alone. The main homeless area is around 6th and Market, heading towards the  Civic Center , and in the  Tenderloin .  Haight Ashbury  also has lots of  panhandlers , and the area near Golden Gate Park at the end of Haight Street near McDonalds is notorious for junkies and should be avoided at night.   Pickpocketing, purse snatching, and other forms of petty crime are common as with any other large city. Be especially cautious on crowded Muni trains and buses, in heavily touristed areas such as Fishermans Wharf, and during the busy holiday shopping season.  Do not leave valuables in your vehicle, especially when parking on public streets.  Car break-ins are very common in San Francisco, and any valuables in plain sight are in danger of being stolen. During your visit, you will probably see small piles of broken glass on sidewalks throughout the city, which are the result of such crimes.  If you cannot carry all valuables with you, try to keep them in the trunk and park your vehicle in secure parking garages, which are slightly safer than street parking but are not completely free from crime either. Bicycle theft is extremely common so bikes should be securely locked to a sturdy surface, even if youre going to only be gone a minute.   Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area. There is a high rate of lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area. If a bulls eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical help and treatment with antibiotics.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">A little bit of common sense goes a long way. On the whole, the city is quite safe, but you shouldnt take that as a cue to be careless. If youre downtown or in what looks like a sketchy neighborhood, nothing will probably happen to you, but you should still lock your car door, keep your valuables secure, and not put yourself in potentially dangerous situations. Some of the worst areas are in the inner-city districts just surrounding downtown, particularly parts of Mulligan Flats (SE-SW 15th Between I-35 and Western), NE 23rd St., NE 36th Street, Martin Luther King Boulevard, NW 10th Street, South Central Avenue, South Shields Boulevard, and South Robinson Avenue; you might want to avoid being there especially after sundown. Also steer clear of particularly seedy-looking bars, although not all are created equal. Keep your wits about you and youll be fine almost anywhere in Oklahoma City.  You might want to check the  Tornado safety  page if you are visiting Oklahoma City, as it sits in the heart of "Tornado Alley" but the local media are always all over any developing severe weather. Peak tornado season is in the spring, with April and May being the months with the most severe storms. Summertime heat is also a concern, as average high temperatures during July and August are typically in the mid 90s though humidity levels are usually not as high as parts of the adjacent deep south. Temperatures over 100 are also very common during the summer months, but all businesses are air conditioned, as well as hotel rooms and other public places. While snow is not uncommon in the winter, it typically falls only a few times and in small amounts, but be advised just a few inches of snow can be enough to cause much more havoc than in more northern locations...drive safely!</field>

		<field name="content">Weather conditions are posted at the visitor center, but flash floods can occur in the park without warning. The danger is not limited to just hiking in slot canyons. People have been washed off trails to their deaths during flash floods. Although its gorgeous when the rain pours, its not a safe time to be on the trails. Flood waters originate upstream, so a flood may occur when the weather does not seem bad overhead. If hiking in a narrow canyon and the water begins to rise even slightly or get muddy, begin looking for higher ground.   Remember to be careful of steep cliffs; people have died falling when they venture too close to the edge. Loose sand and pebbles on stone are extremely slippery. Be extra careful near the edge when using cameras or binoculars. Never throw or roll rocks; there may be hikers below. Stay on the trail, stay away from the edge, observe posted warnings, and if you have children with you, watch them carefully!</field>

Bring extra food, just in case, and always carry chains in your car as the road restrictions can come up quickly.  Do not feed the bears. Do not leave food or food wrappers in your car.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Areas of the city you may want to be aware of your surroundings are: south side of the city - Terry Road, Raymond Road, and McDowell Road.  On the west side of the city - West Capital Street, some parts of Highway 80.  On the northern area of the city - Baily Avenue, and parts of north-western part of the city: Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Northside Drive. Keep in mind that most of these areas are typically not visited by tourist, and they are mostly the older areas of the city that are in decline.     Keep in mind that a majority of the crimes in the city of Jackson are typically residential house burglaries, and typically are not against individuals or tourist.  However does not mean you should not let your guard down, and leave your street smarts and your common sense at home.  The Jackson police department    keeps weekly reports of where crimes occur across the city for public viewing.   Use the same precautions as you would in any large metropolitan city.  Protect your vehicle by locking it up and activating the alarm system, and do not advertise yourself as being wealthy or as a tourist.  If you are in an area of the city looks dilapidated, use common sense and promptly leave to more secure grounds.   If staying at the hotels nearby the fairgrounds or the coliseum in Jackson, keep your room door locked and bolted, and always keep your vehicle locked and in a lit area (if possible).  Use precautions whenever someone expectantly knocks on your room door, and immediately contact the front office to validate the hotel staff is requesting access into your room.  Visitors to the area hotels have been victims of robberies and assaults in the past.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Pay special attention to the weather when traveling on highways in Wyoming.  If the snow gates are down, do NOT ignore them.  Be aware that at higher elevations (including most of the states mountain passes) snow can fall in June and even July. There are large expanses of land between towns that are wholly uninhabited, and getting stuck out on the interstate in whiteout conditions is an extraordinarily hazardous predicament to be caught in to say the least! If you must travel in winter, keep your gas tank full and carry some snacks - just in case you get stuck. If stuck in a blizzard, do not leave your vehicle.  The states abundant wildlife is a big attraction but may also pose a hazard to visitors. While youre unlikely to be stalked by mountain lions or grizzly bears, there is a reasonable chance that you may encounter antelope, moose or deer on the states highways. When you see signs that say "open range", be especially cautious, as cattle may enter the roadway along with the usual assortment of four footed creatures.   Wyomings prairies are prime habitat for rattlesnakes. If you intend to get out and explore the historic trails throughout the state, a pair of sturdy hiking boots and a healthy awareness of the presence of rattlesnakes will serve you well. Do not explore the back country of the states National Parks, forests or wilderness areas without basic knowledge of how to handle an encounter with bears or wild cats.   Wyoming is largely safe and crime rates are low. Locking your car and keeping valuables out of view makes sense anywhere in the state, but especially in town and cities, some of which are contending with epidemics of crime related to meth and alcohol. Its unlikely that you will experience anything bad, especially if you take reasonable precautions to keep yourself and your possessions safe.   Drunk driving is another hazard in Wyoming. Penalties for drinking and driving are severe for first time offenders. Some cities have taxi service (Casper even has a "Tipsy Taxi" that will take you home from the bars), but others do not. Public transportation is unheard of in most of the state, and the towns that have transit systems do not cater to late night revelers. You should plan to have a safe ride home before you start drinking.</field>

The most dangerous animal in the county may be the large population of deer, who will stand in the road and just look at you while you bear down on them at 60 miles per hour. They pop right out in front of you from woods and fields, day and night. If you see one, slow way down, there will be more behind, they travel in small herds and do not get out of the way. Infrequently, you will have the same experience with farm animals. You may find them in the middle of the road during winter months licking salt off of the roads. They will not move.</field>

The most important measure to stay safe from bears is to keep all unattended food in approved bear-proof containers provided by the park. Even non-food items are a risk if they have a smell. Things you might not think of like toothpaste and sunscreen should be locked in the bear locker. When hiking, make noise by talking, clapping, singing, or wear a bear bell. Bears will usually avoid humans if aware of their presence.  Bear spray  can be carried as a last resort.  There is a 5 mph speed limit for boats within the bay. Stay between the channel buoys when entering the bay. Submerged rocks are a hazard especially on the north side of the entrance.</field>

Inner city neighborhoods, particularly on the West and South Sides, should be avoided at night, though they are of little interest to tourists.

The Atlantic City Police Department patrols the Boardwalk via bicycle and ATV details. Like any other major city, it is always wise to be aware of your surroundings in this heavily visited tourism district. Many areas away from the casinos are significantly less safe.  Like many cities that attract money and gambling, Atlantic City has a significant population of homeless beggars. The homeless arent aggressive and are usually found asking for change on the boardwalk. Simply say "no" or ignore them. Theyll usually move onto the next person.   The casinos themselves are very well-policed and if you run into problems, simply ask security for assistance. Be careful with your winnings! Theres always a chance that pick pockets are waiting for an opportunity to cause trouble. If youre lucky enough to win at the slots, but feel uncomfortable carrying large sums of cash to your car or hotel room, ask the casino for either an escort or to receive your winnings via check.</field>

		<field name="content">Alaska enjoys a comparatively low crime rate and is generally a safe place to travel. Keep in mind that while Alaska is wild and beautiful, it does not tolerate fools easily. It is quite possible to get lost, cold, wet, and even die, all within sight of downtown Anchorage. The states populace varies between extremely friendly to tourists to openly hostile. A common bumper sticker says: "If its tourist season, why cant we shoot em?" Many Alaskans are understandably tired of those people from the "lower 48" who head North to live out ill-conceived mdash; and sometimes fatal mdash; fantasies of living off the land.  The remote parts of the state are its jewels, but be prepared for the trip you plan. Do your homework, and plan on being self-sufficient.  Consider using a guide, or checking out local conditions with locals before jumping in the kayak, and heading for yonder point that looked so nice on the map.  The water in Alaska is so cold, falling overboard can be fatal within minutes.  More importantly, self-rescue becomes impossible often within seconds, especially around glacier-fed rivers.  Treatment for hypothermia is required reading before doing any water sports, even during warm weather.  A word about bears: Theres an old joke about how to determine if you are in bear country in Alaska. Take out a map of the state and make a circle around the downtown area of Anchorage. If you are outside the circle, you are in bear country. Although a humorous way of phrasing it, this is absolutely true. Assume bears are present in any area of Alaska, even if you do not see them. Both black and brown bears are present in Alaska. Polar bears are also present in the far north but you probably wont be going all the way into their territory. If you do, it would be wise to make peace with whatever higher power you may believe in before walking around anywhere without a very large gun.  Be especially cautious just after sunset and  just before dawn. Never leave food, water, or garbage unattended outdoors or it may attract a bear. Bears are wild animals and their behavior can very unpredictable. Never approach a bear. Never run from a bear as it will see you as food and it can run faster than you. If you encounter a bear you should stand your ground. Make lots of noise and wave your arms. If you have any metallic objects bang them against one another. In most cases, even when bears charge humans, they do not attack. But if you run towards one, surprise it while it is eating, run from it, or get anywhere near a cub, the chances of an attack are greatly increased. While it is amazing to see bears, the safest thing for you and for them is to observe them quietly from a distance and never approach them closely. Keep in mind that if you leave food or garbage out and a bear eats it, even if you dont see it happen you have endangered the bears life. Studies have shown that the previously employed tactic of trapping and relocating bears that have become habituated was not effective. the bears either returned to the same areas eventually or sought other sources of human foods. So now "trouble  bears" are killed by park rangers or law enforcement agencies instead.   Moose are even more  common in most areas of the state, and are just as dangerous, and attack humans more frequently than bears. Moose may be herbivores and seem like slow-moving, lumbering animals, but they have sharp hooves and can strike with surprising speed and accuracy. Moose are not territorial, but they do have a strong desire to defend their "personal space" especially mothers with calves. Signs that indicate a moose is agitated include the laying back of their large ears, lowering the head, snorting and stomping their hooves. Unlike with bears, it is wisest to simply run if a moose acts aggressively towards you or charges. They just want you to leave them alone, so keep your distance.  Be aware of moose as well when driving. Every years dozens of moose are killed and many humans injured or killed by collisions between vehicles and moose. The long legs make it dangerous as often the bumper of the car will strike the moose only in the legs and its enormous body will impact the windshield, so slow down if moose are present and be aware they sometimes get "spooked" by cars and will suddenly sprint in unpredictable directions.   If you are traveling with a dog, keep it restrained at all times. Dogs have been known to antagonize moose, wolves, and even  bears and are often injured by the quills of porcupines. It is no fun to pull little spikes out of a dogs face with a pair of pliers, so for the sake of both the wildlife and your dog, keep it under your control and dont let it run free.   See  wilderness backpacking  for more information about staying safe in areas of known bear activity.</field>

		<field name="content">New Hampshire is constantly ranked among the safest states in the country. Crime is typically not a problem, but make sure to be careful while driving—especially if youre unfamiliar with winter driving. Moose occasionally wander onto the roads in the  White Mountains  region and Northward and are a serious hazard. When hiking, bear encounters are possible and the weather can change rapidly at higher elevations, especially in the Presidential Range.  Also, there are no state licensing requirements for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or handgun.</field>

In that distinctly Chicago fashion of invisible barriers respected on both sides of the law, crime stays almost exclusively on the west side of Western Avenue.

However, the crime rate in Clarence is negligible, and realistically speaking, travelers have nothing to worry about in this regard.  Clarence is locally notorious as probably the only town in Erie County that actively enforces the "residents only" policy of its parks. Visitors to Clarence town parks who are neither residents of the town nor guests of a resident could theoretically face trespassing charges, though in nearly all cases police will send visitors on their way without incident. Of course, it is more likely that the police will not happen to be around at all. Still, visit town parks at your own risk.</field>

It is not wise to venture off major streets.  The area around Temple University is very dangerous.  If you do travel through the area, stick to a major thoroughfare like Broad Street. It is also unwise to be in this neighborhood after sun down. Northern Liberties is also known to be high in crime often from robbery by gun point. Criminals are known to target drunk students and residents. The Philadelphia Police Department acknowledges Interstate 95 is a major access route directly into and out of the neighborhood, making way for easy strikes.</field>

Even there, most places are completely safe during the day and important main entertainment and cultural centers are heavily policed after dark.   Use common sense traveling in and through urban areas, especially after dark.   If you choose to explore Michigan by car, be aware of local road conditions, especially during winter. Western Lower Michigan and the UP are subject to lake effect snow which can accumulate quickly.  There are quite a few lumber roads in the U.P., some of which are still in use.  Dont be tempted to travel these roads, unless a) youre with a local who can keep you from getting lost, and b) you have an emergency kit (including food, water, first aid) with you.  Such roads are frequently one lane wide, and lumber trucks travel faster than youd expect.  Explorer beware.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">New Jersey is a fairly safe place to visit. Suburban and countryside areas are very safe along with most Jersey Shore towns. Cities are mostly safe but do exercise common travel sense. Some neighborhoods of Camden, Newark, Atlantic City, Jersey City, and Trenton are crime prone but it is unlikely that you will visit these areas. As in most US cities, when out at night, stay in well lit and well trafficked areas and you will be fine.   New Jersey has the highest density of car ownership in the United States so expect crowded highways and the occasional irate driver. Many major highways are under construction for expansion purposes, resulting in delays. Traffic tends to move well above the speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike, The Garden State Parkway, or other highways and you can expect to be tail-gated when driving in the left lane. Best to stick in the middle or right lane if you dont like that sort of thing. The watchword is, drive defensively.  Under no circumstances whatsoever are you to import firearms into the state. New Jersey does not recognize any out-of-state gun licenses and there are no gun offenses that are graded below a felony. Police are known to enforce these laws vigorously, and if caught with a firearm you will be prosecuted, even if you are just a hunter traveling through.  Also, it is illegal to import fireworks into the state unless they are mandated by a municipality for special occasions to be attended by the public at a park or on the shore (i.e. Independence Day). However, youll find that this is worked around quite easily - it is impossible to cross the border into Pennsylvania and not see signs for on-the-border fireworks shops.  Although the media and other sources portray residents as "rude" and "loud," most natives are proud of their state and are more than willing to help a tourist with directions and other tips. Dont hesitate to ask for assistance. Some areas - especially the famed Jersey Shore - are very used to tourists.</field>

		<field name="content">Newark can be unsafe if you are not careful. Car theft and car jackings are the biggest crime in Newark. Home invasions come in second. Downtown Newark is crowded and safe during the day.  It empties out at night and may seem creepy, but as long as you stay in well lit open areas you should be fine. The Ironbound district has most of the great restaurants and is pretty bumpin on nights and weekends and is probably the safest part of the city, behind Downtown and residential Forest Hill. If you were to go to a concert at the NJ Symphony Hall or see an event at the Prudential Center you should be fine. They are well lit areas with a police presence and are the safest part of the city.   The North, South and Central Wards have heavier crime rates and it pays to be more guarded in those areas.  Although bustling during peak travel hours and almost completely safe in daylight, Newark Broad Street station (NJ Transit) can be very dangerous after hours and through the night when fewer people wait for trains (usually from 10pm-5am). Armed robberies are common and can occur even when you are not the only one waiting for a late train. If you do find yourself at the station after hours, wait in the lobby beneath the platform, or failing that, one of the lit waiting booths on the platform. Look confident, dignified, and do NOT display cell phones or iPods.  Remember, the best advice to be given about doing business in stickier neighborhoods is just keep your wits about you. If caught in a confrontation, act confident, no matter how scared you might actually be. Afterwards, make yourself scarce, fast. Remember that money and material things can be replaced, while lives cannot. Newarks community has been known to have weapons.</field>

		<field name="content">Cougars are endangered but have been sighted in the area.  They are light brown felines, 5–8 feet long (including the tail).  In the unlikely event that you encounter one, dont approach it, and dont run.  A cougar expects prey to flee and will react like a house cat chasing a mouse.  Pick up any small children or pets.  Make eye contact, spread your arms to make yourself look bigger, and back away slowly.  If it approaches you, make noise and throw things at it; let it know that youre dangerous too.  If it attacks, dont curl up defensively... fight back.  Cougars rarely kill humans, and are more likely to strike from an ambush position on a child or small female than a family or adult male.  The explosion of deer populations in Michigan parks has led to a large number of deer ticks, an unpleasant parasitic insect.  Ticks are known to spread diseases such as Lyme Disease, and leave a painful, itchy bite.  DEET-based repellents and clothing treated with Permethrin will prevent tick bites.  Ticks cling to thick grasses and brush along paths used by deer, which also unfortunately include hiking trails made by man.</field>

		<field name="content">Leptospirosis - Be aware of leptospirosis, a serious bacterial infection. The bacteria is spread by the waste of animals and is found in all fresh water outlets as well as the muddy trails. It is more common on Kauai than other islands, and should be treated promptly with antibiotics. Symptoms are flu-like, and mainland doctors may not recognize the disease as readily. It is very important to treat any water you gather while camping or backpacking with pills or a filter to ensure you kill all bacteria found in it, not just leptospirosis.  Rip tides, currents, and high surf - Rip tides and ocean currents on Kauai can be treacherous. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Kauai can be especially dangerous because of the lack of a protective reef around many beaches. Many popular swimming areas can be extremely dangerous. Visitors are especially cautioned to not enter any beach on the Na Pali Coast, which has been the site of multiple drownings.  Sunburn - The UV index in Hawaii often exceeds 12 in the summer. People with lighter complexions can receive serious sunburns in as little as 15 minutes. Always wear a good sunblock and/or UV-blocking clothes. Sunburn can easily ruin a vacation. If you get a bad sunburn, however, the  Wilcox Memorial Hospital  in Lihue can prescribe medication to alleviate the symptoms.  Prepare for the area you are visiting. Kauai has a few different climates in its boundary, so you will visit many different areas. For instance, you may wear flip flops and bikinis at Poipu, however you would want a jacket, boots and long pants while up in Kokee.  Kauai is an everchanging, adapting part of an island chain. It is constantly eroding and changing. Beware of drop offs, sharp edges, water safety and the land and ocean around you in general.  Remember that as much as you need to keep yourself safe, you need to keep Hawaii safe as well. Please practice the Leave No Trace principles to make sure everyone can enjoy the islands. Its not only illegal to do things like feed or hassle wildlife, take rocks, sand or plants, but its also immoral and detrimental to the Hawaiian Islands. They are the most isolated land mass on the globe and have many species and landscapes that are struggling to survive under the pressures of tourism. Respect the aina the best you can. Do not cut trails, litter, or desecrate natural or man made sites.       Wikipedia:Kauai</field>

		<field name="content">Milwaukee like all major American cities has a relatively high crime rate, but since most crime is concentrated in specific poorer areas the majority of the city is perfectly safe. Though virtually all tourist destinations in and around Milwaukee are safe and accessible during the day and night, common sense should always apply. Like anywhere, it helps to be aware of your surroundings. Like in most American cities, dangerous neighborhoods tend to be very run down.  The areas of Milwaukee along the lakeshore (also there where most attractions are) tend to be the safest.  The west and south sides of Milwaukee also offer interesting tourist opportunities that include Milwaukees famous Basilica and Frank Lloyd Wrights Greek Orthodox church. Crime can happen anywhere; dont let geographic stereotypes dictate your travels.  The area bounded by I-43 on the east, Capitol Dr on the north, North Ave on the south and Sherman Blvd on the west contains some of the poorest areas of the city and is especially dangerous. The Near South Side also has serious gang-related crime problems but is fine during the day, especially along the main commercial streets.</field>

		<field name="content">Fort Lauderdale can be very safe but there are some parts of town you should probably avoid if you are on foot at night.  Like all cities, you should ask advice on what areas are safe and what to avoid. The areas likely to be frequented by the tourists, along the beach, shopping along Las Olas and down town are safe. This would be the NE and SE parts of the city.  You should use more caution if the address is on the West side of the city NW or SW. The intersection of Andrews Ave and Broward Blvd designates the NW NE SW SE sections of the city. Avoid the NW and SW areas, especially at night. The central part of Broward County West of Andrews Ave to the florida turnpike is not a place for tourists. Suburban cities that should be avoided include Lauderdale Lakes, Lauderhill and especially Sistrunk.   Rental cars stand out as obvious targets for thieves, so never leave valuables in a visible place (put any purchases or valuables in the trunk) and always lock your car doors.   Tourists may find South Florida drivers get impatient with the heavy traffic during high season. Try to plan your route before setting off and remember that US1 tunnels under Las Olas Blvd and the river. It may look like the two intersect on a map but they dont. South Florida has quite a few senior citizens on the road mixed in with their crazy teenaged offspring, so be alert.   Emergency telephone number for fire, police and rescue emergencies is 911.</field>

		<field name="content">Unfortunately, in recent years the city of Camden has been ranked as among the most dangerous cities in the United States.  While in Camden, it is best not to travel alone at night, or flaunt expensive jewelry, electronic devices, or anything with significant value.  The ranking of Camden as among the most dangerous cities is based on its level of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft. It is best to avoid the poor areas of Camden, however it is usually safe around the riverfront area.  Use common sense in protecting yourself.  Most of the suburban area surrounding Camden, however, are very friendly and safe (Audubon, Collingswood, Haddonfield, Haddon Heights, Haddon Township, etc.).</field>

		<field name="content">Although most areas in Jersey City are generally safe during the day, exercise caution when walking alone at night. Streets are virtually deserted after midnight, making those walking alone easy targets. If possible, walk in large groups, or take a taxi. If you must walk alone, stick to well-lit, major streets and dont flash your wallet, cellphone or iPod.  Try to avoid the southern section of the city, bordering Bayonne, particularly the neighborhood of Greenville. In particular, Martin Luther King Drive and Ocean Avenue should be avoided. Muggings are not entirely uncommon in this primarily low-income area, and drug and gang violence are rampant. Hang around after dark at the light rail stations AT YOUR OWN RISK, as there have been series of robberies and muggings recently on the LRHB lines near Danforth/Garfield/LSP.   Property crimes are becoming increasingly common across all of Jersey City. Do not leave any valuables in your car.</field>

		<field name="content">Be smart, dont travel to towns with a lot of crime at night. These towns include: Roosevelt, Hempstead, North Amityville, North Baldwin, Wyandanch, Rosedale, North Bay Shore, Central Islip, New Cassel, Brentwood, Uniondale and northern Freeport. In the daytime, these areas are generally safe.   Other than those towns, which most locals could tell you is where most of the  dangerous crime occurs, crime on the rest of Long Island is related to drug-arrests and burglarlies of high-end neighborhoods. Most robberies are related to hired help, and are low-profile crimes. However, the most recent epidemic crime problem has been the increase in heroin use among Long Island teens, particularly of wealthier neighborhoods along the North Shore. Generally, this should not be a problem for a tourist.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite the fact that Buffalos crime rate has fallen steadily since the 1990s, it is still higher than the national average for cities its size. Downtown Buffalo registers more crimes than other areas of the city, but this probably has to do with the fact that it has a far denser concentration of people and businesses than other neighborhoods. Though the usual precautions should obviously be taken—locking your car doors, keeping valuables out of sight, being aware of your surroundings—the central business district is patrolled vigilantly by police officers, and generally speaking, it doesnt "feel" especially unsafe by Buffalo standards.  That being the case, those who choose to indulge in the Chippewa Street nightlife scene should understand that reports of pickpocketing, drunken brawls, and (less often) more serious incidents are quite common. The Buffalo Police Department has responded by sharply increasing their patrols on Chippewa and surrounding streets, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, and aggressively enforcing laws concerning the serving of alcohol. However, its still too early to tell to what degree this will affect the persistent problem of crime in the entertainment district. Visitors to clubs on Chippewa should take extra care to be aware of their surroundings and should not hesitate to make themselves scarce if they find themselves in a heated situation.  Panhandling is an increasingly common phenomenon in many neighborhoods of Buffalo, including downtown. In particular, panhandlers seem to be fond of Main Street, especially from the Theater District south to the 500 block. They can be a nuisance, but they are rarely aggressive. A polite but firm "no" almost always suffices.</field>

		<field name="content">Greenwich is probably one of the safest towns in America with crime rates well below the state and national levels. In fact you can walk around all night and feel completely assured that nothing bad is likely to happen except possibly tripping on a root.  That said, it would be wise to walk on the side of roads even on quiet side streets as many teenagers tend to enjoy speeding down them.  Also, a overprotective police force is a problem. As Greenwich has a pretty low crime rate, bored police officers like to bust people for minor traffic violations just to keep themselves busy. Stay calm and pay the fine, getting excited about the injustice of the situation will only lead to more problems. Also, if you are any other race beside white or dress in a "hip hop" manner, expect extra police attention.</field>

Should you feel strong, violent shaking, seek higher ground immediately.    Signs are posted all along the coast directing you to tsunami evacuation areas.</field>

Beware of other wildlife as they may defend themselves if threatened, carry rabies, or themselves be in danger by your close presence.  Snowstorms blow in quickly and can cause power outages, especially in more remote locations, as well as blocking off roads with several feet of snow that may fall in a single night.  Bring extra food, just in case, and always carry chains in your car as the road restrictions can come up quickly.  If you are renting a car during October - late April request tire chains be included.  This is typical when renting a vehicle in Reno but may be more difficult to find if picking up your vehicle in San Francisco or Sacramento.  Hitchhikers are quite common all around Lake Tahoe.</field>

The tornado sirens are tested at noon on Wednesday, but they are not tested if it is rainy, stormy, or very windy. You might want to check the  tornado safety  page if you are visiting Tulsa.  Tornado season is normally in the spring and early summer, but they can occur anytime during the year.  Oklahoma Weather is very harsh on road conditions and road repairs are needed on an almost yearly basis. Please be prepared to slow down or stop for road workers as fines double for accidents in work zones as specified by Oklahoma State Law.   Swimming in the Arkansas River is inadvisable due to the large amounts of pollution and the currents created by the dams near downtown.  The intersections along 71st Street, especially the one at Memorial, are amongst the most dangerous in America. Drive defensively.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite being a nice vacation destination, Phoenix is a major American city and as such does contain a fair amount of violent crime. Some parts of the city (and even a few parts of some of the suburbs) should be avoided at night.  Downtown Phoenix is safe during the day, but does have a problem with the homeless/transients, some of whom approach well-dressed office workers and tourists asking for spare change. South Phoenix can be unsafe in some areas.   Maryvale, a commercial/residential district on the west side of the city of Phoenix (extending north into Glendale as well), should be avoided at almost all times unless there is a specific reason to go there.   Most of the suburban areas are safe during day and night; however, parts of Mesa and Glendale can be dangerous at night. Some portions of Tempe, near the main campus of Arizona State University (ASU), have seen assaults in the recent past on a few university students. The ASU campus is equipped with several emergency call boxes.  The Sunnyslope area (north central city of Phoenix) has some homeless and other crime issues but a new police station was recently built at Peoria and 7th Ave which has dramatically reduced crime.  The town of Guadalupe (immediately west of Tempe and bounded by Interstate 10 on the west) is unsafe at night, but is an incredibly interesting Hispanic/Native American community to visit during the day. Be warned though that the speed limit suddenly falls from 40mph to 25mph as you enter the town.  In every portion of the Phoenix area, just use common sense and be aware of your surroundings.   Phoenix also has one of the highest car theft rates in the country, with a car stolen every 7 minutes. In addition, red light running is more common in Phoenix than any other city in the U.S. Use caution at every turn.  Speeding, tailgating and aggressive driving are common on the freeways.  Be aware of traffic and speed enforcement cameras at most major intersections.  Always anticipate someone attempting to beat the amber light before it turns red to avoid being issued a very expensive traffic ticket (usually in the amount of $300 or more). If you see sudden braking, make sure youre going the speed limit. Sometimes, camera vans are set up on the side of the road to snatch speeders, especially in the Northeastern parts of the Valley.</field>

		<field name="content">The areas of and near Taos of most interest to the traveler generally have little crime, although the potential for petty theft from unlocked cars always exists, particularly in remote areas (e.g. at trail heads in the national forest).  The main concerns are weather and road hazards.  Winters can be harsh, particularly at higher elevations, and the wise motorist uses snow tires and has chains or 4 wheel drive available from November through March.  Keeping warm clothing and an emergency kit in the car during this time is a good idea.  Heavy snow creates hazards for outdoor recreation as well; use extreme caution in the mountains, as avalanche conditions are frequent.  During the summer a different hazard appears: lightning.  The Sangre de Cristos generate thunderstorms that produce frequent cloud-to-ground strikes.  If you go hiking in the high country during summer, make sure youre off the high summits by 1 p.m. at the latest, and keep an eye out for earlier-than-normal electrical activity.  Another contributor to safety concerns on the roadways is the unfortunate but undeniable fact that  northern New Mexico  has severe problems with drunk driving.  Taos has less problems itself with this than some nearby areas, but vigilance on the highways is still a good idea, particularly after dark and on the highways into and outside the town.  Another safety hazard along the road to Taos are rock slides that may leave large rocks in the roadway capable of damaging the undercarriage of your vehicle.  Take curves with caution and be prepared to slow to avoid hazards.  The danger of rock slides exists primarily on New Mexico state road 68 between Espanola and Taos.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">When driving at night in the city, stay in your car along major urban corridors (like Euclid, Chester and Carnegie Avenues heading east and Detroit and Lorain Avenues heading west). At night, you may want to avoid inner city neighborhoods and the City of East Cleveland in its entirety (in this case, including Euclid Ave).  East Side Driving Tip Many of the citys so-called "rough" neighborhoods are on the east side.  However, tourists in general wouldnt have any reason to visit these neighborhoods.  University Circle on the east side, where all the citys main cultural instituations is safe, however.  Nevertheless, keep a watchful eye on your surroundings in the evening when vast parts of the neighborhood are deserted.  Eastern inner-ring suburbs such as Cleveland Heights, University Heights, Beachwood and Shaker Heights are all very safe.  A good rule of thumb is - once an East Side suburban "Road" becomes an Inner City "Avenue", turn around and get directions to Euclid, Chester or Carnegie Avenues. Example: Cedar Road in the East Side Suburbs (where it becomes the "Fashion District") is a really nice corridor, but once it becomes Cedar Avenue in the City of Cleveland proper, you should pick one of the above mentioned roads that run parallel to its north. Similarly, Chagrin Boulevard (which connects the upscale communities of Shaker Heights, Beachwood (including Clevelands "Restaurant Row" and the bulk of the East Side office market), Pepper Pike, Orange Village, Moreland Hills, Hunting Valley and Chagrin Falls) turns into Kinsman Road (an "underground pharmaceutical" neighborhood) once crossing into the City of Cleveland proper.  West Side Driving Tip Again, staying on Lorain and Detroit Avenues, I-90, I-71 or the Shoreway (State 2) is your safest bet. However, driving West 25th (which becomes Pearl), State and Ridge isnt all that terrifying.  On the near West Side, avoid the Public Housing Projects that abut the vibrant neighborhoods of the Flats, Ohio City and Tremont.  Cleveland is ranked 7th in National Crime Rate Statistics.  Avoid eye-contact, walk assertively, stay in lit areas, be aware of bushes/trees/corner, dont walk too close to buildings,  Dial 911 from any telephone for emergency police, medical, and fire services.</field>

Some areas of the Southside off of 3rd St. can be sketchy at night, and Lehigh students have a notorious reputation for drinking, so be wary of visiting at night if youd rather not deal with inebriated college kids.  The same type of drunken misconduct can also break out late at night during Musikfest as patrons make more trips to the beer tent, and it occasonally results in scuffles on and around Main St. (which gets extremely crowded around at closing).  If you use common sense and dont stray from the main attractions you should have no problems, and Bethlehem is far safer than neighboring Allentown or Easton.</field>

It is not recommended to drive through these areas.  Be aware of your surroundings at all times.  If it looks like the neighborhood is going downhill it might be best to turn around rather than drive through.  It is not recommended to walk alone or in small groups after dark in the downtown district unless you stay in the well populated areas near the casinos and bars.</field>

		<field name="content">Downtown has a lot of one-way streets which can be confusing and are not always well marked so look at the direction in which cars are parked.  Sacramento is generally a safe place to visit.  As with any other urban area, no matter where you are, stay safe.  Be aware of your surroundings, lock your car doors, dont carry a large amount of cash, and dont wear flashy clothing or jewelry.   As with other large metropolitan areas, there are neighborhoods that deserve more caution than others at night.  Be cautious while in the following areas:  Central District--especially at night.  Most of the businesses close up early, though the nightclubs there can draw crowds and those looking for trouble especially after too much to drink.    South Sacramento Area--especially at night. It has been cleaned up in recent years but there are still rough patches especially around Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, Fruitridge Road, Franklin Boulevard, Mack Road, and Meadowview Road.  North Highlands--at night, prostitutes are usually strolling Watt Avenue between Roseville Road and I-80.  The motels at Longview Drive and I-80 are some of the worst in the north Sacramento area. Avoid them if at all possible.  Del Paso Heights used to be of the worst crime infested areas in the Sacramento Region, but has recently attracted numerous galleries, boutiques and restaurants. Stay safe, but theres no reason to avoid it.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">While temperatures in Glacier Bay are mild compared to  Interior Alaska , the rainy, overcast and cool weather, combined with temperatures that are near freezing every night, make hypothermia a real danger.  Dress in warm layers that wick moisture away from the body, and always carry a waterproof outer layer as well as a hat and gloves.  Bears are large and unpredictable animals that are most dangerous when surprised or when lured by food.  Make noise while hiking to alert bears to your presence, and always store food, trash, and toiletries in bear-proof containers kept 100 meters from your camping area.  When kayaking or boating in the park, stay a safe distance from glaciers, icebergs and cruise ships, and carry tide charts.  Glaciers can calve at any time, and the resulting massive waves can easily swamp vessels that are too close.  Recommended safe distances are one quarter mile from all tidewater glaciers.  Be careful when around icebergs as well, as they may flip at any time.  Cruise ships create large wakes and are not very maneuverable and should be given a wide berth.  In addition, the tides in the park can be as strong as 6-8 knots.  Carry tide charts, and know how to read them.  A small vessel caught away from shore during a strong tide can easily be swept several miles out to sea.  Lesser dangers in the park include potential for giardia from drinking water from streams.  Boil or otherwise purify all water when in the backcountry.  More of an annoyance than a danger, the mosquitoes, gnats and black flies can test a persons sanity.  When there is no breeze to keep the insects at bay they will swarm and bite mercilessly.  Bug repellent is often ineffective, so carry a mosquito net and wear clothing that covers all exposed skin; you have been warned.</field>

Your main threat is on the roads from sightseeing drivers not paying attention to the often slow or stopped traffic. Food purchased at the numerous road side bakeries, cheese plants or home made canned items like jellies or preserves should be considered quite safe. If you buy farm eggs, they will likely be very fresh and tasty.  Animals:Keep in mind that this is not a petting zoo type situation. The animals may bite, kick or step on you, or especially your children. Never allow your child to walk up on a horse, buggy, or other farm animal. Animals in pens may be more accessible, but can pass on other diseases.  Touching should be avoided.</field>

		<field name="content">West and South Berkeley, especially near Oakland, can be unsafe at night. In 2001, Berkeley was reported to have the second-highest crime rate for large California cities, though many Berkeley crimes are drug-related. While the north side is quieter and generally safer, use common sense and avoid walking alone at night.  Also be aware of your surroundings: the more bars on windows, generally the less safe the area. Bicycling is generally a safe way to get around at night; for those who prefer not to ride, free night escorts are provided by the University of California police near campus: call +1 510-642-WALK (9255).  Berkeley has a well-deserved reputation for protests, riots, and strikes, and you may see a protest or two in progress during your visit.  However, the vast majority of protests today are raucous but protesters are typically strictly nonviolent. (The same cannot always be said of the police, and its worth keeping a wide berth of any in-progress police action unless youre willing to risk a rib or two.)  The last time the National Guard was called in to patrol the city was 1991.</field>

Most areas of the city are safe, including the areas around Duke and most of the outskirts of the city. The areas immediately around downtown (stretching a few miles east and south of downtown) are not always well lit or well patrolled. Basic rule of thumb – use common sense like you would anywhere else: use caution at night, avoid walking alone, lock your car, and remove valuables when parking.  Most violent crimes in Durham, while not particularly frequent, are drug related or domestic and by avoiding the drug trade one can avoid these issues.  The police are generally quite helpful, friendly and understanding. Dont hesitate to call them if youre feeling uneasy or threatened. There is very low tolerance for drinking and driving, however, and of late checkpoints have sprung up on both main and secondary roads.</field>

If you plan on being outdoors on the park lands for any length of time at all, bring and use generous amounts of sunscreen.  Likewise, plan on drinking plenty of water for several days before as well as during your visit to the park.  Wear light-colored, loose-fitting cotton or moisture wicking clothing and good, sturdy, closed-toed shoes.  Watch where you step!  Scorpions and snakes, though rare in heavily trafficked areas, are not unheard of in the Texas Hill Country.  Close-toed shoes are the first defense against creatures that bite or sting when startled or frightened but nothing beats avoiding such an encounter altogether.  Be prepared for insects.  Should you be allergic to any type of insect common in the American South or Southwest, bring any medication you might need.  Insect repellent may also come in handy, particularly if you plan to visit during the dusk hours.</field>

Keep all valuables within sight and within reach at all times. Your car is not a safe place to store anything: Thieves have commonly dismantled locks and broken into vehicles, or conversely will just bash open your window to get in. Use extra caution when visiting less savory parts of town, including the Chinatown district after dark, but during the day you should have no problem.</field>

A wild bear will run away as soon as it notices there are humans nearby, unless it associates people with food by being fed previously. If you encounter a bear and it approaches you, make loud noises by yelling and clapping your hands so that the bear notices that you are a human. If you see one while you are in a vehicle, remain in the vehicle.  Snakes. If you see a snake, leave it alone! All wild animals are protected. There are poisonous snakes including copperheads and rattlesnakes so use ordinary precautions, wear shoes and carry a flashlight after dusk.  Ticks. Several species of ticks are common in the park and there is a risk of tick-borne diseases if one bites you. Take precautions like using tick repellents, wear light colored clothing, long sleeves, and long pants with pants legs tucked into socks if you are in tick habitat. Always check for ticks afterwards. You may not notice a small tick, so if you feel sick after visiting an area where ticks are common tell your doctor of the possibility of a tick-borne disease.</field>

		<field name="content">Most areas of Long Beach are fairly safe, even after dark.  There are two major areas that are not quite as safe and should be avoided after dark.  Caution is called for even during the daytime in these areas.  The first of these areas is in the south-western portion of the city.  This area is bounded, starting from the south-east corner, by Redondo Blvd. and 4th, running north to the Signal Hill border.  Along the Signal Hill border north-west to the 405 Freeway, along the freeway to the western border of Long Beach and Wilmington, down to 4th St.  The second and more dangerous of the areas is North Long Beach (north west of the LGB airport).  The approximate boundaries of this area are from Del Amo and Cherry, north to the north border of the city, along the north border to the west border and back south to Del Amo.  This area, which borders on  Compton , has a reputation for gang activity and is one of the more active police and fire districts in the city.  During the riots of 1992, both of these areas experienced violence, looting, destruction of property.</field>

		<field name="content">Ann Arbor is generally a very safe town, though the usual rules about common sense (being aware of your surroundings after dark and knowing where you are going) apply here as they would anywhere. The only really common crimes in town are those that you find in any other university town. Theft is the biggie, as many university students who leave their bags unattended in the library or those who fail to lock their bikes can tell you. Theres also the occasional mugging or sexual assault, but these tend to occur after dark, so if youre not wandering the streets at 2AM, you probably dont have anything to worry about. Having said that, wandering the streets at 2AM in downtown Ann Arbor is generally quite safe and not at all frightening; there are usually enough students out partying or hanging out with friends until the wee hours that you wont feel like a lone target, or like youre in a dangerous crowd.  U of M Police, Ann Arbor Police, and the Washtenaw County Sheriff patrol regularly and are not difficult to find--indeed, alcohol violations such as drinking on the street from an open container are vigorously policed.  There are emergency phones located all over campus.</field>

		<field name="content">Historic structures and mines are fenced off for your protection. DO NOT ENTER CAVES. Do not climb up bluffs or get too close to cliff edges. Gravity can be dangerous. Bring ample drinking water, or even better, a water purifier. Never drink untreated water from springs or rivers due to the potential presence of harmful organisms.  Poison ivy  and  snakes  are present and protected in the park. Never reach or step where you cannot see. Ticks and chiggers are hard to avoid anywhere in the Ozarks. Long pants and insect repellent (90%+ DEET) help. Light colored clothes make it easier to spot and remove insects. Sturdy shoes and proper clothing are a must to ensure a safe and comfortable out-of-doors experience. Choose campsites that allow an escape route as locally heavy rains can cause rivers and streams to rise rapidly. Do not dive or jump into the river. Shallow water and submerged objects are hazardous. Swim only in clear, calm water and check below the surface for submerged objects. If a lightning storm occurs, leave the river and find shelter immediately. Metal boats and water itself conduct electricity. Prevent wildfires by exercising caution when building or extinguishing campfires. If possible, use a portable gas stove instead of starting a fire.</field>

		<field name="content">Visiting the "tourist" parts of the Big Cave poses no serious safety hazards.  As mentioned above, footwear with balance and traction is a good idea, particularly if youre walking down from the natural entrance; the trail is steep in spots and may be wet due to water dripping from the ceiling.  If youre suffering from ear problems (e.g. blocked Eustachian tubes), you might find it more comfortable to descend into the cave via the natural entrance rather than the elevator, which descends so rapidly that it may cause discomfort due to difficulty in pressure equalization.  When visiting backcountry areas, whether on tours or on your own, make sure you are properly equipped.    Many of the "wild" caves require proficiency in vertical technique that is considerably different than that used in rock climbing.  The Park Services recommendations for any particular cave are usually well thought out and helpful.  Make sure you have sunscreen and plenty of water for any hiking; its sunny, and hot, out there.</field>

Prevalence of dangerous crimes is low enough to actually induce stricter enforcement of traffic infractions, since the police would not have much to do otherwise.   Common sense should prevail, though. Do not hike alone when rambling across the trails in Mill Valley and Mt. Tamalpais. The likelihood of having a negative encounter during a hike is minimal, but you will benefit greatly with the aid of another person should you meet an unsavory character—animal or human—along the way.</field>

		<field name="content">Go out with a group at night and valet your car so that you dont have to walk far at the end of the night. If you are downtown after dark, there is a fairly large number of homeless people in the area.  Uptown and North Dallas are generally safe after dark, but South Side is generally a little bit rougher around the edges than the north sides. Also, avoid driving on the highways on the weekends after 2AM as it can be unnerving with all the bars and clubs kicking everyone out at that time, so most of the drivers have been drinking and are in a hurry to get home.  Cafe Brazil, with multiple locations, is a 24-hour restaurant that has decent food, much better than Dennys or IHOP, and is a good place to wait out the rush or if youre just hungry late at night.  If you are Downtown during the night hours, it is strongly suggested that avoid the Government District, particularly near City Hall. This place is not dangerous in itself, but there are a lot of homeless people running about. Stick to the West End.  In the South Dallas area (South Oak Cliff and Pleasant Grove), try to avoid anywhere south of the Trinity river, with the exception of far North Oak Cliff and the Bishop Arts District. South Dallas is mostly a low-income, high-crime residential area that should not be ventured into, especially at night. There is also nothing to see here except the Texas Theater, where Lee Harvey Oswald was captured, which should be safe to see during the day.  In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft while visiting Dallas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operates a major field office in Dallas.  It is best to avoid dawdling about in South Dallas at night—know where you are going and stay there. It is safer generally during the State Fair of Texas, but avoid wandering too far away. Fair Park is also safe and tourist-friendly during the daytime; however, it is closed during night hours.</field>

		<field name="content">Though many of the animals in the park area are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed. Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals! No matter how docile they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack, and every year dozens of visitors are injured because they didnt keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.  The weather can change rapidly and with little warning. A sunny, warm summer day can quickly become a cold, rainy or even snowy experience. Hypothermia can be a concern. Be prepared for a variety of weather conditions by bringing along appropriate clothing. Lightning can and does injure and kill people in the park area, so watch the sky and take shelter in a building if you hear thunder.  Finally, with so many people visiting the park each year petty crimes are something to be vigilant against. Lock your car doors and exercise sensible precautions with valuables.</field>

		<field name="content">Rampant racism and homophobia are amongst the many stereotypes of Appalachia. Most Appalachians exhibit "Southern hospitality" and are decent folk, not racist, though homophobia and transphobia are more common. If you are concerned about discrimination, keep to yourself, be polite, and most people will do the same for you. Every community has its bad apples though of course. Not all Appalachian states have laws preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity either. You should be prepared to see your share of Confederate flags south of the Mason-Dixon, but this is not always connected to racism, despite the historical symbology. Historically, most Appalachians were strongly antislavery and many were loyal to and fought for the Union during the Civil War, as witness West Virginias split from Virginia. Appalachian Tennessee produced more antislavery newspapers than any other place in the country, many doing so at extreme risk. Appalachian Kentucky had racially integrated colleges nearly 100 years before desegregation. Appalachians have always valued freedom, which is actually the West Virginia state motto ("mountaineers are always free").  If you are staying in a small town or away from an urban area, make sure you know what to do if a black bear makes its way into town or your camp. It is not common but bears are known to come into small towns to forage for food. Other hazards include mountain weather, which can change on a dime and include tornadoes and blizzards, and landslides on mountain roads. Always make sure you obey the speed limit on windy roads (often down to 15 mph on tight curves); unlike the interstate where you may get away with it, speeding on a mountain road may find yourself flying off a cliff.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The Bronx, especially the South Bronx, has a reputation as an area of rundown apartment buildings, prostitution, and high crime. In recent years, revitalization projects have dramatically reduced urban blight in the area south of the Cross-Bronx Expressway (the area hardest hit by arson and abandonment in the 70s and 80s), replacing empty lots and burnt-out tenements with low-density housing.  Some people like to focus on the crime of the South Bronx, but such characterizations are hyperbolic and dont reflect the experience of all of the travelers who have made many trips to the Bronx and walked through all of its neighborhoods. All forms of criminal activity have been reduced to a fraction of their early 90s rates. That said, crime is a fact of life in the South Bronx. But the most common victims by far are the people who live there, not visitors passing through.  To avoid problems, choose a destination or route beforehand so that youre not wandering around an area youre completely unfamiliar with looking lost and confused. The safest areas are the busiest ones, usually around main streets and avenues where residents congregate to shop, work and socialize. These are also the best places to experience the neighborhood and soak in the unique energy and ambiance that makes the Bronx special. To stay safe, avoid the inner courtyards of housing projects and desolate, deserted areas, and cross to the other side of the street or go into a shop if anyone makes you nervous. You may want to avoid large groups of young people congregating on the street if they make you feel uncomfortable, by crossing to the other side of the street. And of course, never get involved in drugs or any other criminal activity while youre in the Bronx.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Violent crime rates by neighborhood   As in almost the entire United States, dial 911 to get emergency help. Dial 311 for all non-emergency situations in Chicago.  Despite a big decline in the crime rate from the 1970s and 1980s, Chicago is still a big city with big city problems. There are run-down areas within a few blocks of some well-traveled places such as near the United Center and US Cellular Field. The majority of the citys violent crimes occur within a relatively small number of neighborhoods well off the beaten path in the South and West Sides, but given the chance nature of crime, you should exercise the usual precautions wherever you go. Even in a neighborhood with a bad reputation, though, you might still have a perfectly good time, as long as it falls within your comfort level.  Take caution in the  Loop  at night; after working hours, the Loop gets quiet and dark in a hurry west of State Street, but youll be fine near hotels and close to Michigan Avenue and the lake. When disembarking a crowded CTA train, especially in the downtown-area subways, be wary of purse snatchers.  Homelessness is a problem in the city and seeing people ask for help is common  downtown . They are very unlikely to pose any kind of problem, though. Most are either holding up a sign asking for some type of assistance while others will actively solicit you for spare change. If you ignore them, they will ignore you. Some do sell a local newspaper called Streetwise to make a living. These people should be wearing a badge of some kind to indicate they sell the newspaper and they keep all the profits they make. If youre feeling generous but want to be safe, those selling Streetwise are your best bet.  A common scam is for a beggar to come up to you and make remarks about how your shoes need to be cleaned or polished. They can be very friendly though very pushy to the unsuspecting tourist. Before you know it, your shoe is up on their knee and they are asking you for some amount they claimed they told you before they started. If you simply ignore them and walk away they should leave you alone. Not often, but some will continue to follow and harass you. If this happens, go inside any restaurant or store until they leave.  In general, common sense will keep you safe in Chicago: avoid unfamiliar side streets at night, stay out of alleys at night, know where youre going when you set out, stick to crowded areas, and keep a $20 bill on hand for cab fare as a bail-out option.  Dress appropriately for the weather. Chicagos winter is famously windy and cold, so cover exposed skin and wear layers in the winter, but heat exhaustion is an equal risk in the summer months, especially July and August. Stay off the road during a snowstorm. Chicagos streets and sanitation department generally does a good job clearing the major roads in the center of the city, but the neighborhoods can take longer, and the construction-littered expressways are anyones guess.</field>

The main attractions for tourists like the Harboryard and the PT Barnum Museum are in areas that are not to be considered high crime. Traveling to the East Side or East End is considered to be the Spanish harlem of the city, as that is where all the Spanish restaurants and shops are located along with a strong catholic religious background indicative of the churches located within this area as well.  Now, downtown is being rehabbed.  The plan is to have apartments in former destitute buildings.  Downtown will be the hustle and bustle it used to be, full of people and shopping happening on a daily basis. Downtown has limited parking so bring your quarters for the on street parking.</field>

Keep in mind that venomous Copperhead snakes are quite common in the Sipsey Wilderness.  Just be aware of where you are stepping, and you should not have any problems with them.</field>

		<field name="content">While Tacomas crime problem has improved over the past decade, the city still has a high crime rate relative to other Northwest cities. Much of the crime is concentrated on the Hilltop and Eastside neighborhoods. The Stadium District area has the lowest crime rate in the city and Downtown has a low crime rate compared to downtown areas of other cities (including Seattle), however visitors should be cautious as in any urban area. Visitors should also be careful when entering the surrounding suburbs of  Lakewood ,  Spanaway  and  Parkland . Crime problems in Lakewood sometimes run over into near by  Parkland . As always when traveling alone or at night, avoid poorly-lit areas with little foot traffic.</field>

Many trails are sparsely blazed and intersections may have no signage whatsoever.  There are no large predators in this area, but  ticks  and  poison ivy  can be found in abundance.  If travelling in the backcountry during hunting season, it is advisable to wear bright colors or a blaze orange vest.  Avoid greys, browns, and white as these are the colors of the White Tailed Deer. There is no gas available within LBL, if planning to spend a significant amount of time here make sure to fill up in one of the many surrounding communities.</field>

		<field name="content">Dial 911 to get emergency (police/medical/fire) help.  Although down somewhat in recent years, crime is still a problem in certain areas of the city. Most violent crime occurs in areas that would not be frequented by tourists. Visitors to the area should be aware that the theft of laptop computers, phones, and other items from automobiles is a common occurrence. Always store valuables in the cargo compartment of one’s car and make sure it is locked.  Motorists who drink and drive will face stiff penalties if one’s blood alcohol concentration is above the legal limit (0.08). Police routinely set up checkpoints along major roads where all drivers must pass through and show their license and registration to check for intoxicated people.  Vehicles are required by law to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. However, the law is not universally followed. Take care to watch for turning traffic when crossing streets.  Areas on the east side of the city along the streets of Livingston Avenue, Main Street, and Mount Vernon between Parsons and Alum Creek sometimes see violent crime. These areas should be avoided at night. Additional areas to avoid at night include Cleveland Avenue between I-670 and SR-161 and the area east of High Street near the OSU campus.  On the West side of town, a sliver of neighborhoods around Broad St. and east of I-270 South are relatively safe during the day, but not at night. Generally, areas outside of the I-270 loop (the Outerbelt) are safer and more peaceful than areas inside, although the area around Brice Road and I-70 is not safe. Safe areas inside I-270 include  the Arena District, the Short North District, Clintonville, Northwest Columbus, Upper Arlington, Grandview Heights, Worthington, Dublin, much of German Village and Bexley.</field>

The most significant threat to public safety comes from the high level of deer that are native to the surrounding forests. It is not uncommon to have a nighttime drive interrupted by a shocking jolt of adrenaline due to these impish mammals suddenly appearing on the side of darkened road. Constant vigilance is strongly suggested during the night in order to avoid a costly accident.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Most safety issues in the forest are a matter of weather and terrain.  Lightning can be a hazard in the summer, avalanches in the winter, and hypothermia-inducing snowstorms practically year-round in the high country of the Pecos.  The respective antidotes are early departures from exposed ridges; awareness of avalanche conditions; and good equipment, particularly when backpacking.  Do not take cotton sleeping bags on backpacking or horsepacking trips in the high forest.  A disproportionate number of search-and-rescue operations result from visitors underestimating the weather and using cotton sleeping bags that become useless when wet.  Use something that will retain its loft.  Be on guard for  altitude sickness  as well; much of the forest, particularly the Pecos, is high enough to cause altitude sickness in the visitor just up from sea level.  As already mentioned, petty crime can be a problem at some of the campgrounds.  Incidents seem most common at the beginning and end of the school year, and also during the big-game hunting season, mainly in October.  Sensible precautions help (lock your car, dont leave valuables in plain sight, etc.), but some of the break-ins seem purely random in nature and appear to be rooted in ethnic frictions.  Some of these frictions extend into the small mountain towns around the forest; the tourist will definitely feel unwelcome in some of the small-town bars (which is one reason why none are recommended here under "Drink").  Keep a low profile.</field>

If your car breaks down, stay with your car rather than attempting to find help on foot. It is much easier to find a vehicle in the desert than a person.  As mentioned above, the monument is on the U.S.-Mexico border. Due to the remoteness of the monument, it is used for illegal border crossings. Most of the persons illegally crossing present no threat to park visitors. However, there are some who use the monument for smuggling who are armed and dangerous. In 2002, a park ranger was shot and killed by a drug smuggler. The Kris Eggle Visitor Center has been named in his honor.  Visitors should be aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activities to park rangers or border patrol officers.</field>

		<field name="content">Allston-Brighton is generally a safe place if you dont mind seeing the occasional drunken hooligan on weekends.  It has a large college student population, so criminals of opportunity - burglars, pickpockets, petty thieves - exist. Peak seasons for them are any time students are moving in and out - May and September. Allston-Brighton also has its fair share of panhandlers and drunks - and not just the students.   Late at night, its a good idea to travel in groups until you know the area. Calling for help is relatively straightforward. However, due to recent budget cuts by the Boston Police Department, response times to 911 calls are significantly longer than they used to be, in some cases 15-30 minutes for police or ambulance response.  Allston-Brighton also has one of the best martial arts schools in America, though youd never be able to tell based on the buildings appearance. The Boston Martial Arts Center   , located at 161 Harvard Avenue, offers self-defense classes six days a week.  In addition, Emerald Necklace Budo Martial Arts   , a traditional karate dojo, is also in Allston, featuring karate and self-defense classes for adult men and women. Jason Gould, the Chief Instructor at the Emerald Necklace dojo, is a certified R.A.D. (Rape Aggression Defense) instructor, and one of the founding members of Allstons Ringer Park Crime Watch.           WikiPedia: Allston-Brighton</field>

There is a nice downtown park at the Five Points intersection of Main Street,Pineapple and Central Avenues. Some homeless people congregate there but there is a city ordinance against panhandling and sleeping outdoors.  The northern end of Tamiami Trail near University Parkway is also known for run-down motels and some prostitution arrests. However there are also college campuses nearby and several coffee shops and a comedy club so people do safely walk around the area.</field>

		<field name="content">Be aware when hiking into the wooded areas of Vicksburg, that you may encounter a black bear (the proper description is the Louisiana Black Bear).  Bear sighting typically increase during June and July (breading season), and have recently have been spotted north in the forests of the cities of Redwood and Steele Bayou.  If you do see a bear or its cubs while in the woods, you are much too close to the bears, and need to carefully but quickly, backtrack from where you came.  Black bears are typically not as aggressive as the grizzly bears, but attacks on humans have been known to occur.   Care should be taken when participating in water sports (i.e., boating) in the Mississippi River.  The currents are very strong, large barges traveling up and down the river generate strong wakes, the water is tan-brown (so you can’t see if you’re about to hit something floating just beneath the surface of the river), poisonous snakes (vipers commonly called a “water moccasin”) are a concern, and occasionally an alligator might be lurking in the water.  Swimming in or across the river is a very foolish thing to consider, and you’ll rarely see any sane person even attempting this feat.   There are some areas of the city you wouldnt want to stroll alone at night, and should use the same level of caution and street smarts (your wits) you would use in any large city. The gas station on Clay Street and Cherry Street is frequently a site of petty crime.</field>

The usual disclaimers about the more active things to do apply. If you have a tour guide, they often have insurance premiums to be beholden to and as such make them more aware of safety issues. But otherwise the island is mostly remote and help can be far away. Know your physical limits.  Prepare for the area you are visiting. The Big Island has many of the Earths climates in its boundary, so you will visit many different areas. For instance, you may wear flip flops and bikinis in Kona, however you would want a full coat, boots, long pants and a hat while visiting Mauna Kea.   Hawaii is an everchanging, adapting island chain. It is constantly eroding, creating and changing. Beware of drop offs, sharp edges, water safety and the land and ocean around you in general.  Remember that as much as you need to keep yourself safe, you need to keep Hawaii safe as well. Please practice the Leave No Trace principles to make sure everyone can enjoy the islands. Its not only illegal to do things like feed or hassle wildlife, take rocks, sand or plants, but its also immoral and detrimental to the Hawaiian Islands. They are the most isolated land mass on the globe and have many species and landscapes that are struggling to survive under the pressures of tourism. Respect the aina the best you can. Do not cut trails, litter, or desecrate natural or man made sites.       WikiPedia:Hawaii (island)</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Austin is one of the safest major cities in the US. However it does not mean that there is no crime.  As with most American cities, credit cards are accepted nearly universally, especially for nightlife. Therefore, for convenience and safety, its inadvisable to carry large amounts of cash. The number for police, fire, and medical services is 911.  In many parts of Austin, there are beggars on the street corners, particularly off of the freeways, who will hold signs asking for money (panhandling). Some of these people are totally fake, while other use this as drug money, therefore is is not recommended that you give to these people.  There is an area near 6th st. and the Red River district that houses a large homeless shelter known as the Arch.  This area is generally safe during the day, but often filled with panhandlers at night.  They can be fairly aggressive and sometimes follow people traveling alone.  In addition, groups of muggers sometimes target drunks leaving the bar scene alone in that area.  There is generally a large, visible police presence (mounted, foot, and cruiser) at night in the 6th St. area.  They are quite willing to let belligerent drunks dry out overnight in the city jail.  They do, however, provide a safe and secure area to enjoy yourself and Austins famous live music.  There is the Rundberg area, where you should not walk alone on the streets by yourself, especially around the I-35 area. Austinites tend to avoid this area.  Because surrounding hills concentrate the water, some streets in Austin and the surrounding area are prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain.  These areas are typically marked as low water crossings but in any event do not drive or walk across moving water.  Each year several people are killed as they are swept away by flooding.  You will also see many flood control structures built into the landscape.  Small, dry low places with bounding berms during the dry season, these are dangerous places to be in, but keep Austin safer when the rains come.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Volcano safety is, to put it mildly, a controversial subject; see the article on  Volcanoes  (and, particularly, its discussion page) for some of the issues.  Compared to many other active volcanoes, Mount St. Helens has been studied extensively, and therefore has a relatively well-defined "safety envelope" that allows informed decision making as regards trail closures, etc.  Even St. Helens, however, is prone to bouts of unexpectedly violent behavior, as for example on 8 March 2005 when an explosive event sent ash and steam to elevations above 35,000 feet (10 km) essentially without warning.  The monument, therefore, has established a policy regarding road and trail closures that at first glance appears unnecessarily conservative -- but it is not.  Believe it.  The closures arent there simply to inconvenience and irritate you.  If a trail is closed due to eruptive hazard, stay off the trail.   Other than the volcanic activity, St. Helens poses basically the usual set of hazards associated with mountainous country -- changeable weather, potential for road closures due to snow in the winter, etc.  One extra thing to be aware of is that much of the area on the north side of the mountain, particularly the northeast, does not yet have many travel services, even things as basic as gas stations.  When leaving the main roads to head for the observatory, or particularly the Windy Ridge viewpoint and trailhead, its wise to have a full gas tank.</field>

Crimes, if any, usually occur in Hempstead, Freeport, Roosevelt, Uniondale, New Cassel/Westbury and Elmont. The Island Trees/Plainedge area of Levittown has seen an increase in crime lately, as well as the western part of Hicksville south of Cantiague Park. Gang violence is rampant in New Cassel, Hempstead, Uniondale, Roosevelt and Freeport. The only safe areas of Hempstead are west of Cathedral Ave, north of Hempstead Tpke and east of Westbury Rd, north of Hempstead Tpke. Uniondale and Roosevelt are safe in the daylight, but be extra careful at night. New Cassel is relatively safe during the day but very dangerous at night. Freeport south of Sunrise Hwy is very safe.</field>

The biggest crime problems in the area recently have been gas station drive-offs (due to recent spikes in gas prices) and convenience store robberies. Violent crime is quite rare, but it does occur on occasion. The rough side of town for Joplin is generally considered west of Main Street. Like most other places, most of the more serious crime happens in the middle of the night. Typical common sense will enable most anyone to avoid problems.  Red light running is a growing problem. Range Line Road is notorious for motorists running red lights, especially well after it has turned red for their direction. Motorists should exercice caution and not dart into intersections immediately when their light turns green.</field>

		<field name="content">The Walker police department, though small, is active in the community and has a very visible presence on the streets.  Walkers downtown is particularly safe. If you are fishing any of the lakes near Walker, do not park in secluded areas, leave as few belongings as possible in your vehicle, and be sure to lock it.  Vehicle break-ins are common. Do not pick up hitchhikers.  They are a common sight along the highway.  It is exceedingly unwise to give them a lift. Be extremely careful when driving.  Roads are often curvy and unsafe, particularly in the winter.  Deer are a serious danger to your vehicle and to your own life when driving in heavily-wooded areas.  Follow the speed limit, and do not engage in impaired driving. Many cabins and cottages are located in isolated, wooded areas.  Burglars can find these places, and often do.  Always lock cabins and cottages when leaving, even for short periods of time.   Keep in touch with neighbors (even if they are some distance away), and be cautious if you hear about crime in the vicinity Play music or leave a television on when you leave a cabin or cottage unattended for brief periods. Leave as few belongings as possible in cabins when gone for the season, and securely lock them. Boarded or barred windows and other such security devices tend to actually attract, not divert, criminals.  Walker is located on the reservation of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.  There is no small amount of racial tension between the predominantly white population of Walker and the Native American population on the reservation.  Also, crime is not uncommon on the reservation (but is not by any means confined to it).  Do not be afraid to drive through reservation areas if youre trying to get somewhere, but it is not advisable to do so for recreational purposes.</field>

		<field name="title">Massachusetts</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Driving - Massachusetts drivers have a reputation for aggressive and careless driving including running red lights and unpredictable changes of lane or direction.  Speeds up to 20 mph (30 kph) over posted limits are common on highways and interstates.  Pedestrians should not count on getting the right of way just because it is legally theirs.  Drinking is a widespread social activity and intoxicated drivers may be encountered evenings after work in working-class neighborhoods, or in college towns on Friday and Saturday evenings.  Winter driving involves snow and ice, December through April.  Deer are abundant and car-deer collisions frequent, especially during fall migrations and breeding seasons which may peak on moonlit nights in November.  Collisions can occur in suburbs as well as alongside forests and fields.  These animals frequently bound high enough to crash through windshields and endanger occupants with flailing hooves.  Although in 1846 author Thoreau had to leave Walden Pond and travel to Maine to observe moose, these larger relatives of deer are recolonizing Massachusetts as old farms revert to forest.  Moose are tall enough to topple through windshields in collisions and adults will weigh about 1/2 ton, potentially a deadly combination for vehicle occupants.  Immediately slow down and be prepared to stop if you should see one ahead of you.  Count yourself doubly lucky to see such a large animal in a densely populated state, and to have avoided a collision.  Outdoors - Ticks can transmit Lyme Disease unless promptly removed. After walking in woods, brush or tall grass remove clothing and look for flattened dark insects 1/8" to 1/4" diameter. If they have already attached themselves touch them with something hot to encourage them to let go. +  Getting lost in thick woods is surprisingly easy, especially in the short days of fall and winter. In unfamiliar areas, plan your route before you set out. Carry map, compass and a whistle or some other way of making noise. Also carry extra clothing and high-calorie snacks in case you are benighted. +  Crime - Statistically, Massachusetts is one of the least violent states.  Nevertheless there are cities with declining or vanished industries where economic desperation makes crime a career option. Other cities have tough neighborhoods, usually with telltale signs like trash in the streets, rundown housing, graffiti and barred windows. Try to avoid walking or using public transit in these areas. Also use paid parking lots and while driving keep windows rolled up and locked. Licensed taxicabs will usually be a safe way of getting around these areas.  Tough neighborhoods have disproportionate numbers of people with bad attitudes.  Try not to "cross" them.  Bicycle theft and car break-ins are the most common types of crime.  Avoid leaving electronics or other valuables visible in your car.  In cities, having a strong bike lock (U-locks are best) is highly recommended as bike thieves do carry bolt cutters.  Leaving your bike parked in a high-visibility area (especially if there are few other tempting bikes around at the time) significantly increases the risk of theft compared to finding indoor parking.</field>

		<field name="content">Try to avoid traveling alone in the economically depressed areas of Benton Harbor.  The area has experienced an increase in evening crimes.  While walking down the rather thin pier (south of the pier containing the 2 lighthouses), be vigilant of your step as the surface of the pier can be icy, wet and uneven due to both crevaces in the cement or bumps.  One has to be extremely careful, especially watching kids, near the edges of the pier as some portions have no guard rails.  Its best to hold little ones hands and stay on the center, more elevated part of the pier when walking, which is further away from the unguarded edges.   Huge gusts of wind and large waves wash upon the pier:  at the very least you and your camera get soaked; at worst, the unsuspecting person too close to the edge could get blown right into the deep, frigid waters of Lake Michigan.  Tall, tall waves smashing atop the pier, getting people wet even when they were on the highest part of the pier can be seen at times.  The choppy waves and their turbulent crashing can make for an interesting sight, but must be handled carefully.</field>

Residents often jokingly refer to  Moreno Valley  as "Murder Valley," for example. Increased outreach and tougher anti-drug operations have made some progress, but there are still some areas in many cities that should be avoided, especially at night.   Remember, not all low-income areas are crime-ridden and drug infested. In fact, many low-income neighborhoods are often host to the best and oldest restaurants in the area.

Crime is relatively low in most parts of Minneapolis that youre likely to visit, but is not unknown.  Be wary of the Near North, Camden, and Phillips communities, particularly at night.  Violent crimes can occur and unfortunately have occurred in all parts of the city.  As in all other cities these crimes receive a disproportionate amount of attention from local media. These tragic events, however, are typically not random so they will probably not impact your visit. You are more likely to be a victim of crimes of opportunity.   When traveling, do not leave any items that can be quickly converted to cash in plain view in cars or unattended at restaurants and other public areas.  These crimes can and do occur in all areas, especially where you would have your guard down.  When you take in the great park system or travel to the unique urban shopping destinations ensure that all valuables remain with you or are secured out-of-view in your vehicle.  Also if you are going to secure your valuables in a vehicle, make sure you store them prior to arriving at you destination.  Thieves are experts at watching people store valuables in the trunk and then striking when they leave.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Be careful when driving on mountain roads, especially in the winter. The roads can be very steep, hairpin turns are common, most roads outside main traffic routes are unpaved, and if youre driving in the mountains, you may find yourself on the edge of a very steep drop with at most a guardrail to protect you. In the winter, West Virginia is susceptible to fairly large snowfalls, which can make the roads treacherous if not impassable, particularly if your car doesnt have good traction on the inclines.  As youre driving, youll also notice road signs at certain locations advising you to be alert for rockfalls in the vicinity. Many of the roads in the state were cut right through the mountains, giving you interesting geological sights as you drive, but bad weather and erosion can lead to rocks coming loose and tumbling down onto traffic below. Its not at all common, but it does occur, so pay attention to the signs and keep alert.  If youre in the state to partake of its outdoor adventures, be sure you follow the usual precautions. During hunting season, wear hunters blaze orange clothing if you go into the woods. If youre canoeing or whitewater rafting, be sure to keep a lifejacket on. And if youre into extreme sports, dont take unnecessary risks; more than one experienced BASE jumper has perished at the annual Bridge Day festivities, most recently in 2006.  Unleashed dogs are abundant, especially on back roads. Carry a large walking stick and pepper spray when hiking and dont venture uninvited onto posted property.   In the woods, its also wise to take precautions against insect-borne diseases. Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are both spread by ticks, and West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, both of which are common in West Virginia forests. Fortunately, the diseases themselves are fairly uncommon in the state, but it never hurts to stay safe. Wear long clothes that cover your skin, use a good insect repellent, and check your body for ticks as soon as you return indoors. The Eastern Diamond Back Rattlesnake and Copperhead Snake are both indigenous to all forests in the state.  Stay out of abandoned coal mines, which can be full of hazards such as rotten timber supports, unstable ground, rats, snakes, undetonated explosives, blasting caps, explosive methane gas, and pockets of "blackdamp" or air without enough oxygen to support life.  In terms of natural disasters, West Virginia is quite a safe place to be. Earthquakes are practically nonexistent, its far enough inland that hurricanes are rarely a major problem, and the mountain range seems to discourage tornadoes from forming, although the state does average about two per year. The most common type of natural disaster in the state is flooding, which can be a serious problem, so pay attention to news bulletins during periods of heavy rain, and stay away from affected areas.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Violent crime is almost unknown in Los Alamos; it is one of the safest communities youll ever visit.  The biggest lawbreaking threat to life and limb is drunk drivers.  Northern New Mexico has an unfortunate and well-deserved reputation for DUI problems.  Until recently Los Alamos was an exception to this, but not any more.  Be alert when driving on the arterial roads after 10PM or so, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  Another driving hazard is wildlife, particularly deer and elk.  Mule deer can be seen around town all year long, day and night.  Herds of elk come down from the Jemez Mountains during the winter and often congregate around the roads.  If your car hits an elk at highway speed, the elk may lose, but you will most assuredly not win.  Again, be careful driving after sundown during the winter months.  Believe it or not, one of the most important types of fatal accident sustained by townspeople is falling off a cliff—sometimes a cliff literally in the victims back yard.  The sheer canyon walls that give the area much of its natural beauty also pose traps for the unwary recreational hiker.  If youre out enjoying the many hiking trails around town, stay on the trail when around a cliff unless youre doing roped climbing.  In most other regards Los Alamos itself is an almost absurdly safe place.  When in the forest camping, hiking, etc., take the usual precautions, with maybe a little extra attention to fire safety; several of the disastrous forest fires the area experienced over the last 30 years resulted from poorly constructed campfires that were not well put out and thus smoldered, eventually starting up again and igniting tinder.  If the national forest is closed to camping owing to fire hazard (as often happens in early summer) or forbids open fires (which can happen almost any time from May until August), please comply and seek your accommodations somewhere else.  One final note: bubonic plague is endemic to northern New Mexico, and plague-bearing fleas and rodents have been trapped from within the city limits.  As cautioned in the article on  Bandelier National Monument , if you see a distressed or dead rodent or other small animal, leave it alone; buzzards are immune to plague, you are not.</field>

Stay at least 100 m away from bears and 25 m from all other wild animals! No matter how docile they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack, and every year dozens of visitors are injured because they didnt keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.  The weather can change rapidly and with little warning. A sunny, warm summer day can quickly become a cold, rainy or even snowy experience. Hypothermia can be a concern. Be prepared for a variety of weather conditions by bringing along appropriate clothing. Lightning can and does injure and kill people in the park area, so watch the sky and take shelter in a building if you hear thunder.  Be aware of snow conditions before heading out in winter, check online at  www.mtavalanche.com   Finally, with so many people visiting the park each year petty crimes are something to be vigilant against. Lock your car doors and exercise sensible precautions with valuables.</field>

You can now view  real time crime reports of the area you plan to visit . One should use the same precautions as you would in any large metropolitan area.  Avoid walking in Southeast San Diego or Barrio Logan (near or under the Coronado bridge) at night.  If you do or must, avoid walking down dark alleyways or approaching unknown people.   Most people do not encounter any problems if they avoid buying illegal drugs or prostitution. In addition, gangs are not as present as they are in Los Angeles, but they still exist.  In an emergency (immediate danger to loss of life or limb), call 911. Be aware that if you call from a cell phone, 911 calls are currently directed to the California Highway Patrol, which can result in delays in contacting city police. (911 calls made from land-line telephones are directed to the appropriate local agency.)   In many cases, when within the city limits, it may be more appropriate to directly dial the San Diego non-emergency number, (619) 531-2000. For example, to report a crime in progress when you are not in direct danger, it is probably best to call the San Diego Police (or other local municipality) directly.</field>

There is only one gas station on the island and it is located in Lana‘i City, so make sure that enough gas is available. Lana‘i may be a small island, but routes such as the Munro trail have limited access and take a long time to traverse.</field>

Bottled water can be purchased at the lunch counter in the Kelso Depot Visitor Center, along I-15 in Baker and at the gas station/store at I-15/Cima Road, at the general store in Nipton, at the Cima store (which isnt always open), and at the gas station in Fenner near the junction of I-40 and old Route 66 on the south side of the Preserve.  Public drinking water is available at the Mid Hills and Hole in the Wall campgrounds, at Mitchell Caverns campground (Providence Mountains State Recreation Area), and from water fountains at Kelso Depot visitor center washrooms (open 24 hours a day) or inside Kelso Depot during open hours.  In the backcountry, water is often available from the cistern at Marl Springs along the old Mojave Road (needs to be filtered/treated). Numerous small springs with varying (and sometimes non-existent) quantities of water exist throughout the Preserve for folks with water filters, such as  Butcher Knife Spring .  Research prior to travel relying on such springs is required. For example, a tiny stream of filterable water was available during one campers visit at  Indian Springs off Kelbaker Road  a day after after Xmas 2007.</field>

		<field name="content">Anchorage is a very safe city for its size. The murder rate is very low.  Certain areas in the north east of the city (Mountain View, north of the Glenn Highway and east of Merrill Field airport) and central (Fairview, 6th to 15th Avenue, east of Ingra) have higher crime than other spots.   Also, areas around the airport like Spenard are known for increased drug activity and prostitution. In earlier times, the downtown area around 4th Avenue was like that, but a concerted effort over the last eight years has cleaned it up mostly.   A constant problem is car break-ins at parking lots. Do not make any valuables visible.  The trails close to and around the university are unsafe when it is dark. During the colder months, there are increased attacks on females going to and from the housing and library.    Also, stay a good distance away from the moose. Although they may appear harmless, they can and will protect their young ones from people, and can charge if they feel cornered or threatened. Never approach them, as they are best viewed from a distance.    Still, if you follow precautions like everywhere else, you will be safe.</field>

		<field name="content">Dont feed the animals! Brevard has some fascinating wild animals, including manatees, dolphins and alligators. All three are protected species, and all interaction (including touching or feeding them) is prohibited. "Friendly" dolphins and manatees seem safe, but they are powerful and unpredictable and may attack humans in the water. Additionally, feeding them interferes with their normal biological drives and reduces the natural fear which keeps them safe from dangerous people. Throwing leftover scraps to a wild gator seems fun - but a gator approaching you for scraps looks just like a hungry gator approaching to eat you! Such gators are inevitably destroyed as nuisance animals, so feeding them is no favor. Other endangered animals such as sea turtles also need your protection - large nests of sea turtle eggs on the beaches are usually marked by wildlife officials and must never be disturbed.  Sunburn can occur even on cloudy days. Re-apply sunblock regularly.  Life preservers are essential for motorized water activities. Even the best swimmers cant stay above water if they are unconscious, and you never know when a rip current could try to pull you under.  Lightning - Afternoon thunderstorms with frequent lightning occur often during the summer. Wait out storms in your vehicle, under dry shelter (not a tree) or indoors.  Hurricanes are not a frequent problem in Brevard County. Hurricanes "headed right for us" usually veer off along the coast without making landfall. A rare evacuation is ordered well in advance so that nobody gets caught on a barrier island. The six-month hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, with the highest danger in September and October. More Information: National Hurricane Center.</field>

		<field name="content">As elsewhere in the region, precautions should be taken to guard against heatstroke and dehydration which can come about very rapidly – always take more water than you think you will need.  Rattlesnakes are active from spring through fall, and tend to hide in brush or in crevices during the heat of the day. The best way to avoid bites is to never place your hands or feet where you havent looked first. Wear boots or sturdy shoes for outdoor activity. If you are bitten, seek medical attention immediately.  In recent years south central Arizona has become a corridor for drug trafficking, particularly in remote areas away from population centers. Hiking and camping in certain areas near the border may be inadvisable; inquire locally as to current conditions, or contact the nearest Border Patrol office for guidelines.</field>

So just remember to drive defensively and youll be fine. Colorado Springs is infamous for speed traps also. Watch out for motorcycle cops (around 5 or 6) along with one or more cruisers waiting to catch you speeding.  The southern part of town is generally less safe than the northern part.  Ft. Carson, on the southern edge of town, is a large Army installation bringing in thousands of young, energetic men and women.  The businesses that these clients would frequent sometimes attract a rougher crowd.  Stay north of Platte or west of Wahsatch, and all should be well.</field>

		<field name="title">Valles Caldera National Preserve</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Most of VCNPs hazards are weather-related:   Lightning is a common hazard during the monsoon season (July–September) when you are on ridges or in open land, and can occur during other seasons as well. Be sure you know what to do when lightning threatens.    Winter storms can roll in quite suddenly and can produce not only several feet of snow in short order, but also precipitously dropping temperatures that can easily reach below zero (Fahrenheit).  If engaging in winter sports, make sure youre well equipped.  VCNP and the surrounding mountains have been the site of a number of disastrous forest fires in recent years, particularly in the spring (when precipitation is minimal and winds are high) following a dry winter (of which there have been many lately).  The Preserve administration is understandably cautious about closing facilities when fire hazard is significant; please honor the closures, as the Valles grasses burn like tinder and a wind-driven fire can travel a lot faster than you can run.  Of course, make sure to use sun screen.  Dangerous encounters with wildlife are rare, but an elk in rut can do a lot of damage to you (closures during mating season will probably keep you away from this hazard, but bear it in mind), and one on the road can do a lot of damage to your car.  Drive cautiously, particularly in twilight.  Rattlesnakes are scarce owing to the high elevation, but can be found occasionally in the summer, even on the ridges.  Violent crime is a non-problem, and there are few if any reports of theft from parked automobiles in the preserve.  However, some of the neighboring forest land has seen some pilferage.  If youre camping in Santa Fe National Forest campgrounds, make sure to secure valuables before heading into VCNP.  Visitors from sea level may have problems with  altitude sickness , as even the Valle Grande is at an elevation near 8000 feet and the mountains range up to 11,000 and above.  If youre prone to altitude problems, spend a day or two acclimatizing in  Albuquerque  or one of the other New Mexico cities before you do anything active here, and plan a slower hiking/skiing pace than you would at home.</field>

		<field name="content">Idaho cities are by and large quite safe. While seedy neighborhoods and organized street gang activity exist, people rarely get into trouble without actively looking for it first. Local police tend to be courteous, professional and at times even lenient provided they dont suspect you of any major wrongdoing. They do, however, take an especially dim view of drunk driving and illegal drug possession.  Major highways are routinely patrolled by the Idaho State Police (ISP), noted for the distinctive diagonal stripes on their vehicles. ISP officers are quick to lend a hand if they see someone in trouble along the side of the road.  The most pressing safety concerns in Idaho often involve the outdoors. Idaho weather can be fickle and extreme compared to other parts of the world. Mountains make their own weather, and it can be sunny one moment and stormy the next.   Its extremely easy to get lost in the heavily wooded back country. Whats more cell phone service is by and large nonexistent in forested areas. Disastrous encounters with large wildlife (including bears and moose) arent unheard of. Dont venture away from established campsites or trails unless youre with an experienced guide.  In other words if you are taking part in some outdoor activity, be prepared. Most importantly, use your common sense.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Crime: Compared to other major cities in the nation, Salt Lake City has relatively low violent crime rates but relatively high rates of property crime. Pioneer Park and the nearby homeless shelter is a popular hangout for drug dealers and should probably be avoided at night. (Recent implementation of surveillance cameras in the park has forced some activity southward and eastward, to Washington Square and Library Square.)    The west-central and northwest areas of the valley tend to have more crime and gang-related activity, and the downtown areas heading east and south are now experience a high volume of drug-related and robbery activity. Car break-ins are common, even in "safe" neighborhoods; park in well-lit areas, lock up, and store valuables out of sight.  For specific and current statistics on crime rates, visit the  local police website .  Adjacent West Valley City (on the west) and South Salt Lake (on the south) have high-crime neighborhoods.  Visitors should exercise caution in any unfamiliar area.  Weather: The weather is generally mild and has few extreme weather events. It can become fairly hot during the summer, but humidity levels are low, while winter can see the occasional major, crippling snowstorm. "Black ice" is a particular hazard for motorists during winter storms.  A temperature inversion, where cold heavy air locks warm light air in the valley, are frequent in the winter months and can last for several weeks. During an inversion, the valleys quickly fill up with dense smog that leads to unhealthy air quality and becomes a hazard for those with asthma or other respiratory problems. Strenuous outdoor activity should be avoided during an inversion. Inversions only occur in the valleys and none of Utahs ski resorts experience temperature inversions.</field>

		<field name="content">Follow Desert Survival guidelines.  The name of the park says it all. Unprepared tourists die each year within the borders of the park. Make sure you have plenty of water (at least a gallon (4 liters) per day, per person) for your activities, whether it be on a back-country trail, or on the main highway. A good rule of thumb is to always carry enough food and water for an additional 3–4 days longer than you intend to visit.  Should you become stranded while driving, stay with your vehicle as it is likely to provide the only shade in the area. Pack plenty of water for your car in case of overheating, especially in summer! Rattlesnakes, scorpions, and black widow spiders are present in the park. Never place your hands or feet where you cannot see first!  If you are going a significant distance on any of the unpaved roads, phone a friend and tell them where you are going, when you will be back, when you will phone them again to tell them you are safe, and give them an emergency number to call (760-786-2342) if you dont get back in touch with them by a chosen deadline.  Some of the unimproved roads eat tires for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and you could lose your spare tire too. In addition, make sure you have more than enough fuel; roads may be impassable and can require unforeseen detours. Dont rely on a GPS routing alone.  Figure out where youre going on the official national park map first, then make sure the GPS device precisely follows the same route. If in doubt as to a routes safety or your vehicles ability to make it, return to established paved roads sooner rather than later.  Cell phone service does not exist in most of the park, dont count on being able to use it in an emergency.</field>

Its also best to be especially cautious during the evenings and night around the P and L District, where there has been an increase in crimes. Most violent crime happens during the late nighttime hours. Neighborhoods east and southeast of the downtown/midtown/Plaza areas are experiencing an increase in violent crime. These areas offer little for visitors and are best avoided. (One exception is the Kansas City Zoo, which is located in Swope Park. The surrounding area is not the safest, but the zoo itself is fine.)  KC is in Tornado Alley, so make sure you check the local weather forecasts and make sure you understand what to do during a tornado.  Tornado sirens are in place to warn of incoming twisters.  The system is tested every month on the first Wednesday at around noon.  If you hear the sirens any other time, theyre serious!</field>

If you are in this neighborhood, or any other high crime neighborhood, take the same precautions as you would in other high crime neighborhoods around the country.

Remember that most common sense rules such as being aware of your surroundings at night and traveling in high-traffic areas at night apply in Miami as it does in all other urban areas around the United States.</field>

		<field name="content">The South Side experiences here can potentially outshine those you could have anywhere else in Chicago. Theres one hitch though, and thats violent crime. Alas, the levels of violent crime in this area, especially in the northwest neighborhood of Greater Grand Crossing, are higher than youd find traveling in much of the world; travel here is not for everyone, and many travelers will find visiting this area of the city to be beyond their comfort level.   Nonetheless, a casual visitor is very unlikely to be the target of crime; you just are not spending enough time here, so the odds are youll be fine. Avoid side streets, where you can run into unabashed drug trade. On main streets, you might get mildly harassed if you look lost, insecure, or unfamiliar with your surroundings — if it happens, avoid eye contact, and keep walking.   Its a hassle to deal with public transport, especially if youre not staying here, and waiting around in the wee hours of the night at a bus stop, having stumbled out of a bar, is not a great idea. If youre going to be at a club, youre going to have some booze, and youll need a ride. Arranging a point-to-point taxi ride is a good idea if you are coming from downtown. Arrange that in advance; residents rightly complain about the difficulty of getting a cab at night.</field>

Drink lots of water (and eat a bit of food to help absorb it), and make ample use of the shade.  If you are stranded on the road outside of Lone Pine, be aware that little to no facilities exist outside of city limits.  You may have to walk, flag a passing motorist for assistance (take care with this advice), or use a cell phone to get help.  Local law enforcement consists of county sheriffs and Inyo National Forest Rangers.   Los Angeles acquisition of water rights has dried up Owens Lake (south of town), which once was similar in character to Mono Lake.  Dust storms now rage during windy times.  If the wind is in just the right direction, Lone Pine gets dusted.  This alkali dust is not good for your health, though it is worse for the health of the citizens of Lone Pine who must endure it constantly.  You can probably safely ignore this warning unless you suffer from conditions like asthma or allergies.</field>

		<field name="content">While traveling in Portland, exercise the same caution you would in any other urban area. Portland is a fairly safe city, especially for its size in the United States. There are areas to be wary of, mostly at night, which include Old Town, 82nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard. If youre just passing by in a car, cab, or train, dont be too worried, but be aware of the occasional crime on public transportation at night as well.  Recently, LGBT people have been the target of hate crimes, mostly around gay bars. A volunteer foot patrol,  Q Patrol , keeps an eye on the gay hotspots on some summer weekends to deter potential attacks. The Portland Police Department is generally quite responsive to anti-LGBT crime, and even works closely with the LGBT community to ensure overall safety.</field>

		<field name="content">Flash floods can occur in the park without warning. The danger is especially high when walking in narrow slot canyons such as Grand Wash. Although rainstorms in the park are beautiful, its not a safe time to be on the trails. Flood waters originate upstream, so a flood may occur from a storm that is miles away. If you are in a narrow canyon and the water begins to rise even slightly or the wash begins to get muddy, begin looking for higher ground.</field>

Various poisonous snakes including Rattlesnakes and dangerous animals such as mountain lion and big horn sheep are found in this region especially in the hills. Caution is advised during outdoor excursions. Crime in this area is considerably lower than other areas of the nation. Locals are often willing to aid those in need however the low population density means fewer amenities including hospitals.</field>

		<field name="content">Weather. Badlands NP visitors must come prepared for the weather. Temperatures can exceed 100°F (38°C) in the summer, while winter temperatures can dip below 0°F (-18°C). Temperatures fluctuate through the day, sometimes widely. Thunderstorms and blizzards can come up suddenly. Exposure. Carry plenty of water (1 gallon per person per day), a hat, appropriate sunscreen, and sunglasses. Also consider that the park can be very windy. Wildlife. The animals in the park are less of a threat to visitors who pay them the proper respect.  However, ending up on the wrong end of a bison can mean a hospital stay or death for the park visitor.  Visitors should also be wary of the poisonous (but seldom deadly) prairie rattlesnakes, a subspecies of the rattlesnake. Prickly pear cactus. These small cacti hide in the prairie grass. Wear shoes with thick soles and watch you step. If their flowers are blooming, they are easier to spot. Water. There is no potable water in the park except at the visitor centers. Boiling, filtering, or treating with chemicals does not make the water drinkable. Getting lost. The vast areas of the park off the established trails or out of the designated areas can become very confusing. Good map reading and land navigation skills required. Unexploded ordnance. The Stronghold unit has any number of unexploded bombs and shells left over from the 1940s when the United States Air Force used the land as a gunnery range. When exploring the area keep an eye out. Do not touch any unexploded ordnance. Note the location and notify park rangers as soon as possible.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Stay on the path:  Throughout the park and the Southwestern national parks, you will see warnings about cryptobiological soil.  Footprints erode the soil and destroy years of growth.  Leave your dog at home: As the climate indicates, there is extreme heat in the summers.  Perhaps more importantly, the environment is not supportive of domesticated pets.  There are reasons that there are still 1000-year-old corn cobs in archeological sites: items do not deteriorate like they might in your backyard.  Cactus and Fido do not make for good bedfellows.  Leave only your footprints, take only photographs: Do not take rocks or any other type of souvenir from the park.  Allow your grandchildrens grandchildren to see the park as you see it when you visit it.  Throughout the Southwest, you will walk right next to archeological sites.  These are rapidly disappearing as people take just one little thing back home.  Summer temperatures can reach or exceed 110°F (43°C), so it is important to carry (and consume) enough liquid to keep you hydrated. One gallon of water per person per day is recommended. When hiking on open rocky areas, be aware that lightning is a danger during storms. Also, the dry sandstone-dominated terrain is susceptible to flash floods during thunderstorms. The most intense thunderstorms occur from July through September, during monsoon season.  Many of the formations within the park are sandstone and can easily crumble when climbing.  Numerous individuals must be rescued each year after they scale a formation and then discover that they cannot easily get back down; know your limitations, and be aware that it is usually easier to climb up a formation than it is to climb back down.</field>

In particular, stay to the busy and well lighted parts of downtown after dark, and avoid the neighborhoods immediately south or east of downtown after dark.  The NC State University campus and vicinity are safe and heavily trafficked during the day and evening, but use the university’s public safety escort service in the early hours of the morning.  Throughout Raleigh, you should think before using an automated teller machine (ATM) after dark, unless its located in a mall or other heavily traveled, well-lit area.</field>

The gang crime and robbery problems that plague the nations capital simply do not spill across the district borders, with a robbery rate of just 100 per 100,000 residents in 2007. You might occasionally hear murmurs of Silver Spring or Wheaton having a crime problem, but this notion simply does not align with reality as shown by police statistics. Unless wandering alone late at night in an isolated part of a deserted downtown area, you are quite unlikely to become a victim of a crime.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Wildlife poses the greatest threat in the Hills. Keep your distance.  Bison roam free in the region, and herds frequently cross and block highways.  They are temperamental and unpredictable; if you get stuck in a line of cars backed up by a herd, stay in the car, roll your eyes, and wait for them to cross.  Do not leave the car to approach the animals.  A docile-looking bison can turn into over a ton of enraged, fast-moving muscle and horns before you know it and with no obvious provocation. In the rare event you encounter a mountain lion, walk away backwards very carefully and slowly.  Never show the back of your neck to a lion. Mountain lion sightings are becoming more prevalent. Rattlesnakes are not aggressive unless they are messed with. Be very careful not to surprise one when climbing.  Encounters between hikers and rattlers are uncommon but not unknown, and the way to deal with an encounter varies according to circumstances.  If you actually see the snake, back away from it a short distance (8-10 feet at most); rattlers can only strike about half their body length, so theres no need to go running in terror.  If you dont see it but only hear it, best is to stop in your tracks until you know where it is, then back away.  If youre hiking in a group, make sure your fellow hikers know the snake is there (say "Snake"), but theres nothing to get hysterical about.  Pay extra attention when hiking at dawn or dusk, when the snakes are hunting (mice, not you). The best reminder for people is that wildlife is just that - wild. Even the more innocent looking animals of the Black Hills like the Prairie Dogs are not pets, and tourists should avoid trying to touch these animals or crowding their holes. Rabies is common.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">American Alligators at Everglades   The American Alligator CAN be a very dangerous predator but it rarely attacks humans. Avoid interacting with alligators during mating season, and you will be fine.  It is extremely common in the Everglades and it is estimated that more than 1 million alligators reside in Florida alone- that is more than all other populations of crocodillian species combined- so caution should always be taken. Take those numbers and measure them against the amount of people who swim in Floridas rivers each year and you will find that the chance of attack is very low. In contrast, if people swam in northern Australias rivers as much as they do in Floridas they would have hundreds or thousands of crocodile related fatalities every year. The alligator grows to 14.5 feet, although seeing individuals over 13 feet is extremely rare for this species.   American Crocodile  American Crocodiles exist in some parts of the Everglades and can grow considerably larger than their alligator relatives. They are, however, very rare and can only be found in considerable numbers in a few isolated pockets along the southern coast. There have been no official documented attacks on humans in Florida by this species, mainly due to its poor distribution (there are estimated to be between 500 and 1000 crocodiles in Florida). They have been known to grow up to 20 feet in length in Costa Rica, but crocodiles of 15 feet are considered large in Florida. This species, like Crocodylus Porosus, can be found out to sea and does occasionally swim between islands in the Caribbean and in Florida. Mosquitos What the species of mosquitos at the Everglades lack in size, they make up for in quantity. The mosquitos are abundant during summer months, descriptions include being dense enough to suffocate cattle and camping lanterns. They can make a visit to  Flamingo  unbearable if one is not prepared. There are restrictions on use of insecticides. Mosquito level information is available at +1 305-242-7700 (8:30AM-4PM), during summer months. Raccoons The Everglades has a species of masked raccoons that grow to be the size of small bears. The mask is very appropriate, as they will quietly burglarize your camp site if given the opportunity.  Reptiles The Everglades are home to an extensive variety of reptiles (alligators, snakes and such), being the cold blooded animals that they are, they are always looking for opportunities to warm up in the Florida sun during the colder months and the heat from the road pavement at night. When driving through the park to  Flamingo  at the tip of the Everglades, you may encounter large alligators and snakes basking in the sun in the middle of the road or soaking up the heat from the road at night. Alligators will likely move on, others may not. Avoid touching or hitting any, it will not be a good experience.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Weather in the park can change quickly, so visitors should always bring raingear, a jacket, sunscreen and plenty of water when enjoying the park.  The park is an active geologic area, and while the chances of a surprise eruption are low, rockfalls, floods and mudslides are unpredictable and visitors should take care when hiking in valleys and along streams.  If a rumbling sound is heard while hiking, or if the water level begins to rise, find higher ground immediately.  Wildlife is generally not dangerous, but common sense should always be used.  Give animals their space - keep at least one hundred yards from bears, but also remember that elk and other animals can be just as dangerous.  A general rule of thumb is that if an animal is reacting to your presence, you are too close.  Never feed any wildlife - it is bad for the animal, and will make that animal more aggressive towards humans.  Do not leave scented items in your car as they may attract bears; food, deodorants, toothpaste, and other items should all be stored in bear-proof containers.  When hiking on the mountain, know your limits and do not venture onto glaciers.  Seemingly solid ground often hides deep crevasses in the glaciers, making hiking dangerous.  Travel on Rainiers glaciers should be attempted only by those familiar with glacier travel or those accompanied by an experienced guide.</field>

		<field name="content">The biggest danger in Dead Horse Point State Park, as well as in other parks in the area, is the weather. High temperatures can easily exceed 100Fº before noon. Visitors should pack at least 1 gallon of water for every person in their party because it is very easy to become dehydrated.  It is easy to get lost if trying to get into the canyons, so if you are hiking, pack more food and water than you think you will need. Tell someone where you are going and have a buddy.  Some of the cliffs in the state park exceed 2,000 feet, so DO NOT go near the edge if there is no barrier to keep you from falling off the top of the cliff, and if there is a barrier, you still need to use extreme caution while looking into the canyons.  Finally, if a thunderstorm is near or over you, try to get to a shelter; if none is around, get close to the ground, and if you are in a canyon, get to higher land immediately because flash floods start easily.</field>

		<field name="content">Glen Canyon National Recreation Area has a severe desert climate and it is very dangerous to head out into this wild expanse without proper preparations and gallons of water. If you are the least bit unsure as to what constitutes "proper preparations," visit a National Park Service visitor center before heading into the backcountry.  If driving in the area, carry extra gas and plan your route to take into account the very long distances between gas stations. If driving on dirt roads, be aware of your limits (and your cars), and prepare for the possibility that either the road could wash out in the case of a storm, or that your car could break down dozens of miles from civilization, with no cell phone service, in the unforgiving desert climate.  As with most of  Canyon Country , flash floods are a sporadic, but ever-present danger. Be sure to avoid parking in a wash and never head into a canyon before checking the current weather reportmdash;far-off rainstorms will flood canyons even if they are miles away from the downpour.</field>

Help can sometimes be a long way away and cell-phone services is spotty.  The high-desert environment is one of extremes: autumn and winter can bring harsh snowfalls, while daytime summer temperatures can easily reach ninety degrees or more with considerable drops at night. Of course, altitude variances compound the issue: it could be 80F and sunny June day in  Burns  (4147 / 1264 m) yet snowing on Steens Mountain (9733 / 2967 m) - a major regional attraction - some seventy miles away. Always check the weather conditions of where you are and where you are going frequently, and carry layers of clothing so that you can adapt to any sudden changes.  Yes, there are rattlesnakes. No, they wont hurt you if you dont bother them. Same goes with the rest of the wildlife, to which the same usual rules apply: dont feed them, dont approach them...just leave them alone.  Be aware of hunting season if you plan on tromping around by foot and dress accordingly.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">There are no major safety issues in this region.  A few minor ones, however:  The north side of the range was the scene of pronounced ethnic conflict (of complicated origin) in the second half of the 20th century, and there are still residual Anglo/Hispanic tensions in some areas.  Simply being respectful goes a long way to defuse these, but its probably wise to avoid small-town bars on the north side, and to be alert at backcountry campsites there.  Please take restrictions on open campfires, etc., seriously.  These mountains are flammable and have seen a number of nasty forest fires recently.  If backpacking or backcountry camping, purify stream and lake water, as Giardia parasites are present in water supplies, as usual.  (Tap water is OK.)  Be careful also not to get water in your nose or eyes if youre bathing at one of the "wild" hot springs; dangerously pathogenic amoebas have been found in some of the springs and can cause life-threatening brain abscesses.  You probably wont have any problems from them, but keep your head above water just to be on the safe side.  In many regards the Jemez dont "feel" like high mountains, but they are, and the sun is intense; use sunscreen when outdoors.  Not so much a "safety" issue as a legal one: SR 4 west of the Valle Grande is notorious for radar traps and has numerous, basically inexplicable changes of speed limits that afford opportunities for traffic citations.  Pay attention when driving here.  DUI is a problem in much of northern New Mexico as well, and can be a concern in this region, although its less of one than in the valley.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Like many other urban cities in the United States, Elizabeth does have its problems, nice areas and bad areas. However, problems can be avoided with common sense. Do not go to areas of town you know nothing about during the night, without someone who knows the area well. It is not very likely that you will be a victim unless you make yourself a victim. The people of Elizabeth carry a mentality of handling their own business and not interfering with others. Thus, if you are walking alone at night, try to remain in well lit areas. It is relatively safe as long as you avoid staring at groups of people. Even if an activity looks suspicious, 9 times out of 10, they are not even worried about you unless you seem to pose a threat or meddle in their business like a police officer would do.   The downtown area close to the Port of Elizabeth can be very dangerous at night time even for the residents, so stay away from this area at night, and never ever handle large sums of money in public. Otherwise, walking through the city during daylight hours is not a problem, and you should have nothing to worry about. North Elizabeth, Elmora, and Elmora Hills are the calmest parts of the city, and the cleanest.   Also, Elizabeth is a very diverse city with ethnic groups consisting of a majority of Hispanic/Latino citizens from almost every Latin-American nation, especially Colombians, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans, along with Portuguese and Brazilians, and a large African-American community; others include Italians, Polish, Asians, and White Anglo-Saxons. Respect the diversity. Any racial remarks or slurs in any part of the city can result in major problems and confrontations.</field>

This is true of kayaking, canoeing, sailing or any other kind of boating.  The water is cold and hypothermia can set in in a short amount of time.  Dense fog often rolls in very quickly as well as the occasional storm.    If you are determined to go out on your own, it would be foolish and could result in serious fines from the Coast Guard or a Marine Patrol officer to do so without every single passenger:  wearing a PFD and/or  having a compass and knowing how to use it and/or  understanding how to navigate safely around other boats and water hazards  There are numerous companies on  Mount Desert Island  and elsewhere that offer guided sea kayak, sailing, and power boat tours.</field>

However, property theft and drug activity have seen a sharp increase within the city and there are certain parts of the city that are dangerous even during the daytime.  Dr. Martin Luther King Drive (formerly named Lakeview Ave, and turns into Cottonwood Rd), Union Ave, parts of East Bakersfield and areas surrounding the Kern County fairgrounds and South High School are plagued by gang violence and can be very dangerous. The Bakersfield suburb of Oildale (which shares its borders with Bakersfield at the Kern River) has a bad reputation for racism and poverty.  However, attitudes towards minorities have improved significantly over the years in Oildale, and the town is relatively safe (although not a tourist attraction).</field>

While you are unlikely to be the victim of a crime here, you should take normal precautions that you would in any urban area, such as keeping your car and hotel room locked at all times. If you have a problem, dial 911 to contact the Arlington Police.  Be aware that the metro closes at midnight from Sunday-Thursday and at 3AM on Friday and Saturday nights. The time of the last train is posted in each station. Metro buses operate 24 hours a day but on a greatly reduced schedule at night. If you anticipate being out very late at night it is a good idea to carry the phone number of a taxi company with you.</field>

		<field name="content">As in almost the entire United States, dial 911 to get emergency help.  Despite a big decline in the crime rate from the 1990s and early 2000s, Apple Valley is still a mediocre-sized city with mediocre-sized city problems. There are run-down areas within a few blocks of some well-traveled places such as near the bowling alley and city high school. The majority of violent crimes occur within a relatively small number of neighborhoods well off the beaten path, but given the chance nature of crime, you should exercise the usual precautions wherever you go. Even in a neighborhood with a bad reputation, though, you might still have a perfectly good time, as long as it falls within your comfort level, assuming your comfort level is above lead pipes to the back.  Take caution in the downtown area at night; after working hours, the MVTA buses get quiet and dark in hurry, but youll be fine near seedy convenience stores and run-down eateries. When disembarking a crowded MVTA bus, especially in the downtown area, be wary of purse snatchers.  County Road 46 on the southernmost part of town serves as the border between Apple Valley and neighboring town Lakeville. CR-46 is highly controversial: law enforcement from both cities rarely patrol the area, afraid of overstepping their bounds. Thus, the road becomes a hotspot after dark and hundreds of street racers flood the roadways conducting battles of velocity, showmanship and pride. Travelers should avoid navigating this area on foot as heavily modified Dodge Neons, Ford Focuses, Geo Metros, Chevy Aveos and Honda Civics whiz past at speeds approaching the posted speed limit.  Beggars are somewhat common, though they are very unlikely to pose any kind of problem. Some sell a local newspaper called Coffee Times to make a living. Do not encourage them. If you feel obligated to give them money, it is a good idea to accompany them to the liquor store to ensure it is spent on booze and not drugs.

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The parks greatest danger is weather.  Summer temperatures often exceed 100 °F, but even during the spring and fall visitors should plan on drinking one gallon of water per day.  When hiking be aware that it can be easy to get lost in the twisting canyons, so let someone know where you are going and bring more food and water than you think youll need.  During storms avoid high open areas which can be prone to lightning strikes.  In addition, be extremely cautious in narrow canyons as flash floods can occur with even a small amount of precipitation.  If you are in a canyon and it begins to rain, look for higher ground immediately; if you can hear the sounds of floodwaters approaching or notice rising water around you it is already too late to seek safety.  During winter ice can make roads dangerous, and visitors may want to consider bringing tire chains.</field>

Motorists entering Tuolumne County on Highway 108/120 should get a full tank of gas in Oakdale and make sure they have water.  In the higher elevations you should have water, blankets, and, preferably, some food.  Areas above about 3500 feet in elevation (most of the county) frequently get snow in winter.  During the winter season, from about November to May, motorists should carry chains.  In most circumstances four-wheel drive vehicles will not need chains but are still required by the California Highway Patrol to carry them. Tuolumne County is also subject to wildfires during the fire season (about July to November).</field>

		<field name="content">Southern Oregon is relatively crime-free. Certain parts of larger cities, such as Medford and Grants Pass, should be avoided during the very late hours of the day, however, as small-town drug and gang problems can arise. Unemployment, particularly from lumber mill closures, has caused minor problems near industrial areas.  Because southern Oregon is so sparse, one of the biggest dangers is getting stuck or lost while driving or hiking. Before you leave, make sure you have an up-to-date map, and that you are not using seasonal roads. Forest fires are also a danger during hot summer months, but these are easily avoided.</field>

		<field name="content">The quality of the Ancestral Puebloans stonework varied greatly from building to building.   Visits to cliff dwellings can be strenuous; many require climbing uneven steps and ladders, involve large elevation changes, or are near steep cliffs. Almost all of the trails in Mesa Verde are difficult. It can get very hot in the summer, and even in the winter it can be quite warm, so drink lots of water and put on the sunscreen.  Be careful while driving, as the roads are filled with sharp curves. Make sure your car is in good shape and make sure theres plenty of gas in the tank, as there is only one gas station in this large park, and thats at Morefield Campground. Many portions of the roads are up against cliffs, so keep an eye out for rocks that may have fallen onto the road.  To protect the fragile archaeological sights in the park, dont sit, stand, lean, or climb upon anything at the sights (that includes ancient walls, structures, ruins, etc.).  For current and constantly updated park information, you can tune your radio to 1610AM.</field>

Most residents do not lock their doors, and in wintertime many people leave their cars running in parking lots as they run their errands.     Violent crime and rape are rare, and usually occur due to the influence of alcohol.  However, women should use common sense when walking alone near bars at night.  Most residents and police officers will pull over and offer rides to people walking at night or in the winter.  The biggest threat are drunk drivers.

Sunburn tends to be a bigger concern here than at many beaches, simply because there are no edifices to provide a retreat—lather up!  The ponies are beautiful, and a big part of the reason that people come to see the island, but they are wild animals, and they will charge, kick, and bite if you get to close or otherwise provoke them. The Park Service recommends never approaching them closer than ten feet, although fifteen feet might be a better rule of thumb. Under no circumstances should you try to feed them.</field>

		<field name="content">Be prepared for massive hordes of blood-thirsty, man-eating, baby-snatching insects that will do their best to drive you from the park.  Depending on winds and the time of year you may be lucky enough to avoid the bugs, but when they are out, the mosquitoes and black flies will do their utmost to test your sanity.  Bug repellent is not sufficient; even if they dont land and bite, they will still buzz into your ears and eyes.  Buy a mosquito-netting headcovering, and wear clothing that is capable of covering every millimeter of exposed skin.  The most advertised danger within the park are the bears.  Grizzly bears are large, unpredictable, and can be dangerous, especially if they are with young.  However, the same can be said of moose, caribou, wolves, and several other park animals.  Keep a safe distance from all animals, make some noise while hiking to allow animals to identify you and avoid surprise encounters, and properly store all food, toiletries, and garbage to avoid attracting wildlife.  There are few trails within the park, so be aware of where you are when hiking.  The tundra is fairly open, so in general it is not easy to get lost.  If you have to ford a stream be very careful, as the water will be very cold and the currents are almost always stronger than they look.  If you are pulled under there is a great danger of spraining or breaking bones, and hypothermia can set in if you cant quickly get out of wet clothes and into dry ones. Be aware also that streams and rivers are frequented by thirsty wildlife and if there are rapids the chance of surprising them is heightened. You dont want to surprise a bear, a pack of wolves,  or a moose so make noise as you approach any noisy streams or rivers.  Should problems be encountered, there is a small medical center located in the "Canyon," about 1 mile north of the Park Entrance.  Another small center is 13 miles (21nbsp;km) north of the park entrance in Healy.  Fairbanks, located 120 miles (193nbsp;km) north of the park entrance, is the nearest large hospital facility.  Rangers can respond to emergency situations and can be contacted using the 911 emergency service.</field>

		<field name="content">The greatest danger in the park is the heat.  Plan on drinking at least one gallon of water per day, and never hike without carrying water.  When hiking, drink frequently even if you do not feel thirsty as the onset of thirst in the desert is often the first sign of dehydration.  During storms flash floods can pose serious hazards, and it is advisable to stay out of washes and canyons.  Additional dangers exist from the flora and fauna within the park.  Stepping on or touching a cactus spine can be an (obviously) painful experience; staying on the trails minimizes the chances of an unwanted cactus encounter.  Rattlesnakes and gila monsters are both poisonous, but in general neither will bite unless surprised or threatened.  Scorpion stings are painful but not fatal, and can be easily avoided by not reaching under rocks.  Javelinas may be dangerous if cornered.</field>

		<field name="content">As with most other urban areas in the US, precautions should be taken when out after dark: stay in groups; do not carry large amounts of money; and avoid seedy neighborhoods. The overall crime rate in downtown Detroit is below the national average, and crime has largely declined in the last twenty years, but the city itself is still among the most dangerous in the country.  Stick to major freeways when possible and try to avoid smaller streets through unfamiliar neighborhoods. How you carry yourself can easily keep you from getting mugged.  Contrary to some peoples perceptions, downtown Detroit is generally well-policed and among the safest parts of the city.   Crimes sometimes occur in downtown, but exercising common sense will go a long way toward keeping you and your valuables safe.  Sporting events, festivals and other large public events are always heavily policed and very safe. Sporadic crime events, mostly alcohol-related and involving groups of youths, have been reported at some of these events but they are by far the exception.  Some of hard core night club music scene is located between downtown venues like the Majestic Theater/Magic Stick complex, places in Hamtramck, and suburban venues in places like Royal Oak. Unless you take a taxi, you will have to drive, navigate the city at night, and typically park on the street. Patrons at some venues, such as Harpos on the east side, should take safety precautions.  Always use caution and ask around before going to a particular venue. People at record stores, guitar shops, "cool" clothing stores, and the like often visit and know which venues are easy to get to and reasonably safe.</field>

Redding also has one of the highest numbers of registered sex offenders in a city of similar size. Drug use (particularly methamphetamine) is particularly high throughout Redding and Shasta County. Burglaries, robberies, and car theft are generally lower than most cities the same size. The number of fatal car crashes involving alcohol is one of the highest in the state of California.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Much of the crime in Allentown is gang related, so it is advisable to avoid poor neighborhoods and housing projects. Active gangs in the city include 18th Street, Black Dragons, Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Los Solidos, Mexican Mafia, GGU Crew, and MS-13.  Thus, Graffiti is very widespread.  In 2006, Allentown had 16 murders, 42 rapes, and 6059 property crimes. The crime index was 6667.5 per 100,000 in 2006, while the national average was only 4479.3. Allentown has a crime rates almost twice the national average in every category, including rape, robbery, theft, auto theft, murder, assault, and burglary. Rougher areas include parts of East Allentown and some neighborhoods of Center City north of  Linden St. and south of Tilghman St. as well as the area between the American Parkway and Lehigh River, just east of Center City.  Random acts of violence and crime against visitors is rare - much of the crime in the area involves people involved in drugs, gangs, or other illicit activities.  It would be unwise to try to buy drugs or other contraband in the city.  It is fairly easy to stay safe by following common sense.  Theft is an issue, so be sure to lock cars and stay out of poorer areas at night. Prostitution and street racing are also issues in Allentown.  Dont walk alone late at night or on dimly lit streets.  The most likely victim of a mugging on an Allentown street is someone who is alone and intoxicated, so keep your wits about you.  If homeless approach you for change, just keep walking if you dont want to give anything. Pickpocketing is not a large problem, but dont flash around your money.  There is a large police presence in the neighborhoods most frequented by visitors, especially Hamilton Street.  Many officers in Center City use bicycles.</field>

		<field name="content">Although the neighborhood has improved considerably in recent years, it still has a reputation for being one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston.  Tourists should not venture in after dark unless theyre completely sure of their destination, or are with a native.  Dorchester Ave. north of Ashmont and south of Columbia Ave is regularly in the news for crime, while Blue Hill Ave and Talbot Ave are even more regulars in the news. Blue Hill Ave is one of the more dangerous streets in the city. That being said,people who have been to cities before should be fine. Just be careful after dark. Most violence comes from gangs shooting or stabbing each other, and tourists are not a major target.  Pickpockets and muggings have been reported at night near JFK / U Mass T station, robbing people of iPods and phones. Be wary at night and keep valuables out of sight.</field>

		<field name="content">Cincinnati is a safe city to visit, however care should be taken when visiting certain neighborhoods. Some perceive downtown as unsafe, but according to a 2011 article by the Cincinnati Enquirer, Downtown is "as safe as the suburbs. ... The most common crime    is theft, which includes shoplifting but not muggings, and the most likely crime youll suffer is having your car broken into." Therefore, its safer to park your car in a monitored lot than on the street. As always, be sure to take proactive steps to ensure your safety regardless of where you are by using common sense.  There are a fair number of Panhandlers, most arent harmful, use common sense and firmly say no if approached.  The safest neighborhood near downtown is Mount Adams, which statistically experiences almost no serious crime.  Some neighborhoods you should avoid, particularly at night, include Avondale, Walnut Hills, The West End, and parts  of Over-the-Rhine.  Over-the-Rhine is becoming a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, but it is still in a transition phase. As of 2013, the safest part of Over-the-Rhine is on Vine Street from Central Parkway to just north of 14th Street at the Cincinnati Color Company building (large sign) and Main Street up to Liberty as well as the area immediately surrounding and including Washington Park (which is monitored security cameras). This area is well lit at night, and has constant police presence. Use caution wandering off by yourself in Over-the-Rhine at night as the neighborhood is inconsistent in its makeup. A good rule of thumb for OTR is to stay on the major streets (Vine and Main) and stay south of Liberty. Travel in a group if possible, or call/hail a cab.</field>

		<field name="content">Block Island is by and large a very safe locale, but as with any place there are certain precautions you can and should take to stay out of harms way.  Far and away the most common causes of injury on Block Island are careless bicycle and moped riders.  If you plan on renting bikes or mopeds, make sure that you wear your helmets, follow the rules of the road, and absolutely do not drink while operating them.  Otherwise, just be aware that other vacationers might not follow these guidelines, and stay alert when on main roads.  When on the beach its wise to wear sunscreen and exercise care when swimming; Block Islands waters are usually calm, but riptides are not unheard of and swimmers have been known to come across the occasional jellyfish.  The only real crime that takes places on the island almost always stems from tourists who have had a bit too much to drink: there are instances of drunk and disorderly conduct every week, accompanied by infrequent bar fights and some petty theft.  Thankfully, this is restricted almost entirely to the late night bar scene and major holidays.  As long you or your fellow vacationers dont get mixed up in any drunken shenanigans, there shouldnt be a problem.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Due to climate change, pine bark beetles have killed large swathes of pines throughout the park. On windy days, beware of falling trees and "widow maker" branches.   The greatest danger to most park visitors is due to altitude.  The entire park is above 7,500 feet and ranges as high as 14,259 feet, so it is important to take time to acclimate before undertaking strenuous activities. Even driving at high elevation can affect sensitive individuals. Altitude sickness symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat and insomnia.  Also note that high elevation increases the chance of dehydration, severe sunburn, and the aggravation of pre-existing medical conditions. Drink several quarts of water per day to ward off dehydration. Wear and reapply sunscreen often. If you begin to feel sick or experience any physical problems descend to lower elevations.  In addition, be aware of the weather.  A bright, sunny day can turn windy and wet within a matter of minutes with high winds and driving rain or snow. Be prepared for changing conditions by dressing in layers and always carrying gear appropriate for both cold, wet weather and bright, sunny conditions.  If caught in a lightning storm above treeline get away from summits and isolated trees and rocks and find shelter (but avoid small cave entrances and overhangs) and crouch down on your heels.  Other park dangers include wildlife - never feed wild animals, and always give them their space.  Animals are unpredictable, particularly if they feel threatened, and even a deer is capable of killing a human.  To protect against larger predators like bears and mountain lions make noise while hiking to avoid startling an animal, and use bear-proof containers to store anything with a scent; this includes food, toothpaste, deodorant, empty food wrappers, or anything else that might attract a bears interest.  Park streams may contains giardia and other water borne diseases, so always purify water before drinking.  Be careful on snowfields, particularly on steep slopes where avalanche dangers may be high.</field>

The most notorious neighborhood for crime in Brooklyn is East New York, an area unlikely to be of much interest to travelers, though many will pass through.  Dont be afraid to pass through it on the subway or LIRR, though—that is quite safe.  Red Hook, while recently trendy, still has pockets of high crime.  Other neighborhoods with relatively high crime include Brownsville and Bedford-Stuyvesant (BedStuy).  However, crime in Brooklyn is nowhere near as bad as it used to be, and the traveler should generally be safe.</field>

Summer is hot and crowded with families although mid-week is still comfortable for sightseeing.

		<field name="content">It is unsafe to venture out onto Maines coastal waters without having the necessary equipment and experience.  This is true of kayaking, canoeing, sailing or any other kind of boating.  The water is cold and hypothermia can set in in a short amount of time.  Dense fog often rolls in very quickly as well as the occasional storm.  If you are determined to go out on your own to do so without every single passenger wearing a PFD and/or without having a compass and knowing how to use it and/or without understanding how to navigate safely around other boats and water hazards is not only foolish but could result in serious fines from the Coast Guard or a Marine Patrol officer.  There are numerous companies on Mount Desert Island and else where that offer guided sea kayak, sailing, and power boat tours.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Richmond has a fairly high crime rate, but the vast majority of  serious crime occurs in and around the citys public housing projects, located mostly in the northeast, eastern and southside sections of the city. Muggings and purse snatchings, however, occur throughout the city, so be careful when walking or standing around at night.  Popular night-spots around downtown, such as The Fan District, the areas around Virginia Commonwealth University and Shockoe Bottom can become dodgy at night, so it is best to avoid walking alone or on side streets. While all of the night spots are generally safe, it is also wise to avoid any confrontations inside or outside of nightclubs, especially in Shockoe Bottom, as incidents have sometimes lead to stabbings or shootings. This goes for fights between other people;  just go the other way.  In addition, much of the free and cheap parking in Shockoe Bottom is located under the freeway and train overpasses and have many dark areas; be aware of your surroundings when returning to your car after dark. As always, use common sense and avoid walking or parking in any areas that seem unsafe.  Most areas of the city are also notorious for car break-ins, so it is always best to have nothing visible inside your car, including shoes, clothing or trash if you park on the street, in open lots, or in unsecured parking garages.  Avoid swimming or wading in the James River within the city, as the currents and dropoffs are notorious for getting the best of even those most experienced with the river. If swimming, restrict yourself to public-access beaches or stretches of rocks such as Pony Pasture or Belle Isles northern side, or avail yourself of local guidance. In addition, if on the riverbanks, be aware of weather conditions, as some areas around the riverfront are prone to flash-flooding.</field>

Expect the interchanges to be backed up to the point where there are lines of cars winding around the nearby neighborhoods. Try to familiarize yourself with the traffic flow before you try driving in it, because if you are in the wrong lane trying to get onto one of the freeways, you will probably not be able to move over and will have to go the wrong direction and take a detour. Gulph Rd and Schuylkill River Rd are winding, steep, and have suprisingly high speed limits even though there are houses on them. Watch out for hidden driveways and sudden stops.  Be careful walking around the town. There are few crosswalks or pedestrian signals. Near the mall, you will be forced to jaywalk if you want to get anywhere on foot. It is not a pedestrian-friendly area by any means.</field>

		<field name="content">Hiking at the Grand Canyon often surprises people who attempt Inner Canyon trips. It can be hotter than youd expect, colder than youd expect, drier or wetter. A prepared hiker is better able to survive the extremes of the canyon.  Even for short walks into the canyon keep in mind that it is a seducer: it seems easy hiking down into it but when you come back up you find that you have over-extended yourself.  Its the opposite of climbing up a tall mountain, where you can stop and turn back when you get tired, knowing that the descent will be much easier.  In particular, do not attempt to hike to the bottom of the canyon and back in one day. Hundreds of hikers each year have to be rescued from the Inner Canyon due to exhaustion and dehydration.  While the temperature on the canyon rim is cool due to its elevation, below the rim it can be very hot.  The vertical distance from the bottom back up to the rim is nearly a mile straight up (1.5nbsp;km), in addition to the distance you travel horizontally.  If you plan to go to the bottom of the canyon, spend the night (permit required), and take enough food, water, shelter, and other backcountry camping equipment to keep yourself safe and sound. If you dont have the equipment, dont go.  For an eye-opening look at the dangers of hiking in and around the canyon unprepared, Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon by Thomas M. Myers (long time resident doctor at the south rim), and Michael P. Ghiglieri (biologist and river guide), describes the various ways in which visitors have lost their lives at the canyon.

Common sense is helpful in determining whether an area is safe to explore on foot or not and the transition between relatively safe areas and relatively dangerous ones are often quite abrupt. It is strongly recommended to avoid most areas at night if you are on foot, with an exception for some large, well lit and heavily trafficked shopping centers. The area also has very high rates of car theft and has at times been called "the car theft capital of the world," so always lock your car and keep valuables out of sight.</field>

The south side around St. Cloud State is generally safe to walk around day or night, but traveling in groups at night is recommended. The south side, past the National Hockey Center, has recently had trouble with car thefts, so take caution. The neighborhoods around campus are safe too, but will get rowdy Thursday through Saturday nights while school is in session with parties. Generally, these neighborhoods violate noise restrictions during these times rather than taking part in other crime. Police patrols have recently been increased. Downtown is safe during the day, and even at night, but caution is necessary after dark as the downtown area fills with bar-goers. If you use common sense and travel in groups, youll have no problems in Saint Cloud.</field>

If you should become lost, injured, or trapped this device will help emergency crews to locate you quickly via a GPS signal. The technology can now locate you to within 10 feet of your actual placement. A great accessory for snow enthusiaists in avalanche zones. Always get weather reports for the area prior to travelling.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The FBI rates Stamford one of the safest cities in its population bracket. However caution must be used in some parts of Stamford, especially traveling past public housing projects. Walking the street is where you will encounter the most danger; avoid certain streets on the East Side (Custer Street, Ursula Place, Sections of Cove Road.), the West Side (Connecticut Avenue, Merrel Avenue, Spruce Street), as well as most of the Waterside (bordered by I-95 on the north, the Greenwich/Stamford border to the west and the Long Island Sound to the south and east; main avenue is Southfield Ave) and South End neighborhoods (The South End is bordered by I-95 to the north, and Long Island Sound to the east, west, and south; main avenue is Canal Street). Although Stamford is rapidly gentrifying, gangs and organized crime have long established roots in Stamford. Use the same caution as one would use in any city especially faced with a violent confrontation or when engaging in illicit activities. Stamford’s homeless population is not large but can be quite aggressive. Be careful of how you carry yourself; in Stamford a quick word might be more effective then simply ignoring a request. Avoid the McDonalds by the main library downtown, especially at night. A lot of gangs and undesirables hang out at the McDonalds as well as a healthy group of aggressive homeless. There are plenty of other (safer) dining options in the area. Also Shippan has a lot of young hooligans roaming around at night. Some may get violent.</field>

As with any area populated by bars, you may encounter intoxicated and/or obnoxious individuals.  Generally, you can negotiate this area without any significant problems.  If you are looking to avoid the younger crowd, it is recommended that you avoid the downtown area after 10PM.    There have been recent shootings    in the area, but these are fairly isolated.  Also, recent reports that drownings are actually criminal acts    have been debunked by, among others, the FBI</field>

		<field name="content">As is the case in other regions of the  United States , common sense is enough to keep you safe.  Be aware of situations that are obviously dangerous -- unlit or isolated locations, rough bars, and impoverished neighborhoods.  If you are an international traveler, keep your passport secure and handy at all times; passport theft is uncommon, but identification is important if you need help from the authorities.   Gun ownership is relatively common in the South, especially in rural areas, but it is still unusual to see a gun in everyday life.  The likelihood of encountering one is remote, but still a possibility.  Gun owners are generally responsible with their weapons, however.  Exercise caution in places like nightclubs, where shootings are not unheard of. Do not approach or cut through a strangers property at night if you are in a rural area or the outskirts of a city: most people who have bought a gun have done so for protecting their family.  Outside of a few big cities, it is likely that people will realize that you arent a local. Whether you hail from Cleveland or from Uganda, some will stare in curiosity, especially in small towns and villages where visitors are rare. Relax.  The targeting of non-whites or ethnic groups for serious harassment is  rare.  If you feel threatened or intimidated, immediately seek assistance from the police. Use your best judgment to protect your safety along with your civil rights.  The South had been traditionally socially conservative when it comes to homosexuality.  However, such negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians are changing and diminishing and now varies depending on where one travels (rural areas would hold more conservative views towards homosexuality).  Regardless, the South is relatively safe for gays and lesbians, as violence against gays and lesbians is rare and South does offer a few gay friendly destinations (such as New Orleans, Nashville, and Atlanta).</field>

Common sense is your best friend; dont ever leave your car unlocked or with valuables visible. Walk in well-lit places at night, especially downtown. The South and East sides of the city are a bit rougher than the rest, and Lee Street in particular is rather sketchy. Best to drive through if you dont have specific business there. When going to places late night on High Point Road, be aware of your surroundings--this is one of the areas that has seen the most increase in late-night crime.  Cops are everywhere and generally helpful but remember they are VERY serious about what they do.</field>

		<field name="title">Santa Fe (New Mexico)</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Santa Fe is a fairly safe city as regards violent crime, despite the widely publicized occurrence of occasional hate crimes.  In reality, the crime rate, with the exception of residential burglary (a definite problem in town but one unlikely to affect the traveler), is not high compared to other American communities of comparable size, and the visitor is very unlikely to have any crime-related problems.  Some of the bars can get a little rough, with ethnic tensions frequently a factor despite the citys multicultural nature; simply dont stir up trouble and you should be OK.  Otherwise, public areas are generally quite safe, and are well yet unobtrusively patrolled by the city police.  Much more of a problem is automobile safety, for several reasons.  Many of the roads were built during a slower-paced, less-populous time, and lack the carrying capacity for the current crowds.  Northern New Mexico has serious problems with drunk driving, and Santa Fe is not exempt from these, particularly late at night.  Another factor is an inexplicably high density of bad drivers and/or decrepit vehicles with poorly secured cargo; natives often speak of having a "New Mexico moment" when something falls off the back of a pickup or trailer and into the roadway in front of an unsuspecting driver.  This is a good place to practice your defensive driving, particularly along St. Francis Drive and Cerrillos Road (the intersection of these two has been voted the most dangerous intersection in all of New Mexico).  Running red lights is one of the state pastimes, and reaches its zenith in Santa Fe; be extremely vigilant when pulling away from an intersection when the light changes.  On the positive side, most motorists are fairly tolerant (if not always aware) of pedestrians and bicyclists.  Finally, be alert for signs of health problems associated with high altitude, particularly if you venture out of town toward the mountains.  The most common problems are headache and/or feeling tired may occur, drinking more water or going to lower altitude may help (a trip down La Bajada to the reservoir will usually do it). Also pay attention during hikes and bike rides, remember you are at 7,000 feet—sunscreen is important, even in the winter. The dryness of the air combined with physical exertion  will often leave you not sweating through your clothes even if its 85 degrees out, and many people wont realize they are working hard without that. Dehydration is a common issue for visitors—bring more water than you might otherwise.  Some visitors report increased sensitivity to alcohol due to the altitude.</field>

		<field name="content">Be especially careful with children around the canyon edges; drop-offs are steep and not all areas are protected by railings.  During thunderstorms avoid isolated trees and open areas and, if possible, stay in your vehicle to protect against lightning strikes.  There is little danger from mountain lions, but should one be encountered gather small children, back away slowly, and make yourself look as large as possible.  Altitude in the park reaches as high as 9,100 feet, so most visitors will experience some shortness of breath while hiking, and in extreme cases headaches and respiratory problems may be experienced.  For those not used to the elevation, pace yourself and take a few days to acclimate before attempting any strenuous physical activity.  Unlike the other national parks of southern Utah, heat is not a major problem due to the parks high elevation. Temperatures rarely reach 90°F (32°C), even during the height of day in summer months.</field>

Bring ample drinking water, or even better, a water purifier. Never drink untreated water from springs or rivers due to the potential presence of harmful organisms.  Poison ivy  and  snakes  are present and protected in the park. Never reach or step where you cannot see. Ticks and chiggers are hard to avoid anywhere in the Ozarks. Long pants and insect repellent (90%+ DEET) help. Light colored clothes make it easier to spot and remove insects. Sturdy shoes and proper clothing are a must to ensure a safe and comfortable out-of-doors experience. Choose campsites that allow an escape route as locally heavy rains can cause rivers and streams to rise rapidly. Do not dive or jump into the river. Shallow water and submerged objects are hazardous. Swim only in clear, calm water and check below the surface for submerged objects. If a lightning storm occurs, leave the river and find shelter immediately. Metal boats and water itself conduct electricity. Prevent wildfires by exercising caution when building or extinguishing campfires. If possible, use a portable gas stove instead of starting a fire.</field>

Many accidents are the results of not signaling properly when changing lanes and running through red lights and stop signs.   Providence is relatively safe, but be careful while walking around the capital city at night. Areas in which to exercise caution, unless you know where you are going, are Camp Street on the East Side, South Providence, and the Olneyville section of Providence.

When an offshore quake in 2005 triggered the tsunami alert system as a precaution, the city was evacuated in 20 minutes.

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">New England is one of the safest regions of the country overall, but it is no stranger to crime. All of the regions towns and cities, regardless of their size, have areas that should be travelled with caution at night.  Larger cities are the best-known for crime because of media publicity but most crimes in big cities occur among friends and acquaintances.  Random acts of violence can happen anywhere, even in smaller towns.  It is also best not to hitchhike.    Furthermore, as with other areas of the country, take care while driving.  You are 200 times more likely to be injured or killed in a car accident than in any random act of violence.  Particular areas to use caution are small, winding roads away from major interstates where cars can travel erratically and at high speeds.  Hikers leaving an automobile at trail heads in remote areas should take care not to leave valuables in the vehicle.  As in the rest of the USA, 911 can be dialled for emergencies, even from pay-phones.  Dangerous animals are hardly a concern in New England.  During May and early June hikers may want to avoid thick woodlands in northern New England or risk being plagued by hordes of tiny black flies.  The best time for hiking is September and October when cold nights have suppressed insect activity.  That said, however, there are many trails with locations exposed to wind and sunshine and minimal contact with biting and stinging insects.  There are rare encounters with poisonous snakes in southern and western parts of New England, but hardly any deaths.  These snakes are so rare that they are considered endangered and it may be against the law to kill them.  The hiker will encounter no poisonous snakes in  Maine  or northern  New Hampshire .  The most dangerous animal likely to be encountered by a hiker in New England is the deer tick, a tiny creature no more than about 2 mm in diameter.  Deer ticks carry Lyme Disease, which can engender severe medical symptoms in the victim.  The best defense against the deer tick is to use insecticides and wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts.  Wild turkeys, bears, and coyotes abound in New England but almost always avoid humans.  Moose can be dangerous to motorists speeding along dark roads in northern New England.  These animals are large and their massive bodies will go right through the windshield when struck by a smaller automobile.  The best defense is to drive slowly through moose crossing areas and watch carefully for moose stepping into the road.</field>

Most of the major shopping centers in Vallejo as well as most of Vallejo east of I-80 and the hills around the west of it are safe enough to travel, but are not completely crime free. However, Vallejo has a reputation for its areas of violent crime. Most of these areas are located in patches west of I-80, where some are labelled locally such as The Crest in the North, and Millersville in Central Vallejo; there is also one in South Vallejo along Magazine Street. Sonoma Blvd. (SR 29) between Nebraska and Georgia Streets is a main location for human trafficking. It is unlikely most of these areas will be of any interest to tourists, but if you plan to be in these areas, be vigilant and use your street smarts.</field>

Polar bears are present in the coastal areas predominantly during August and September but can be found at any time during the year. Polar bears are both extremely dangerous and protected, do not approach or harass the bears and get to building or vehicle.

		<field name="content">The Roseville Police is a very effective police force. Crime is very low, however petty theft around the mall does happen during the holidays. Roseville Police are known for having a ruthless "no tolerance" policy for traffic violations. However, driving can be tough, it has a big city feel especially during rush hour. Avoid Douglas Blvd from Harding Blvd to East Roseville Pkwy especially around lunch time. Around the Galleria Mall during the holidays is to be avoided unless needed. Do not run red lights, they have cameras on them. Traffic aside, Roseville is one of the safest places in the entire area.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">There are no significant safety issues with the park itself (usual warnings about wildlife, sunscreen, etc.), but its remoteness means that you may want to pay a little extra attention to road safety while getting there and back.  Northern New Mexico is notorious for problems with drunk drivers.  Areas near Navajo Nation, as Chaco is, are particularly worrisome, as the prohibition of alcohol on the reservation causes residents to drive into Farmington or Gallup to indulge.  Terrible accidents have happened involving Navajo Nation citizens on the way home after an evening of drinking; be extra cautious at such times.  Be alert also for livestock on the roads, particularly sheep.  Its wise to fill your gas tank in Farmington or Gallup (or Grants or Thoreau) before heading for the park, as services are sparse indeed once you get off the main roads.  Weather conditions and hydration cannot be adequately emphasized. Every year there are rescues of visitors who are improperly preprared for either. From June to October, the Four Corners region is subject to violent afternoon and evening thunderstorms called "monsoons," or by the Navajo, the "male rains." The storms build quickly and can be preceded by strong winds, even into the 40-60 mile per hour range. Tents should always be tied with guy wires, and care must be taken ensuring the tent is not located in even the smallest of drainage courses.   It is safest to hike to isolated areas in the morning with the activity timed to return before mid-afternoon. When hiking during Monsoon season, carry a poncho or other rain gear. Take shelter and avoid trees or outcroppings because of lightning. If caught in a storm, if a feeling of hair raising or tingling is felt, crouch low to the ground, stay out of puddles, and try to keep your body from direct ground contact. Balance by holding on to your shoes. At your campsite, the tent is the safest shelter.  In terms of hydration, carry four to five liters of water when on one of the wilderness hikes. Anything less can be deadly. Drink before you feel thirsty. Set a rhythm where regular "swigs" of water are part of the hike. Even when visiting the "accessible" abandoned pueblos, it makes sense to carry at least a liter and to hydrate regularly. A good ratio is one liter of an electrolyte-filled drink to three liters of water. Consuming exclusively water can dilute eletrolytes and create a deadly body condition. For best results, use electrolytes that have little or no sugar or other sweeteners.</field>

		<field name="content">Tremé is a neighborhood to be mindful about rather than avoided completely. Informed visitors can visit interesting attractions. Still, it is a good idea to dress down, do not display expensive jewelry or video-cameras in this presently economically compromised neighborhood.  Know where you are going and you can walk to the attractions which are just a block or so from the French Quarter or along Esplanade Ave during the day time. Since Katrina has rendered portions of the area relatively sparsely inhabited—the boarded up houses are not a result of blight, they are a result of natural disaster. Regardless, it is not recommended taking random long walks, at nighttime, through the neighborhood, especially in the areas furthest from the French Quarter, and those closest to the Iberville housing projects (west of St Louis Park and south of I-10).  Those who live in major metropolises, such as New York City for instance, would be less inclined to feeling "fearful" in this historic neighborhood. But, as with any place that is new to one, common sense as opposed to fear, is always the advantage.  Keep in mind also that New Orleanians as a people, are exTremély hospitable and helpful.  Daytime events with many people around such as "jazz funerals" at Saint Augustine Church or outdoor concerts at Armstrong Park are very safe.           WikiPedia:Tremé</field>

Regardless of where you swim, always use the buddy system, and always have a way to contact emergency services (note that cell phones often lose service in the low area immediately about the river, so check the signal at your designated "towel spot" before swimming if you will rely on your cell phone for calling emergency services).</field>

While you are unlikely to be the victim of a crime here, you should take normal precautions that you would in any urban area, such as keeping your car and hotel room locked at all times and not walking alone at night.    Be aware that the metro subway system closes at midnight from Sunday-Thursday and at 3:00AM on Friday and Saturday nights.  The time of the last train is posted in each station.  Metro buses operate 24 hours a day but on a greatly reduced schedule at night. If you anticipate being out very late at night it is a good idea to carry the phone number of a taxi company with you.</field>

		<field name="content">Ancient beasties by the lake, Rogers Park  Edgewater and West Ridge are low crime areas, but Rogers Park has some rough spots at night. Chicagoans tend to overstate the crime rate there, largely because its surrounded by neighborhoods where crime is comparatively unknown. By overall city standards, its not particularly dangerous, but dont carry anything irreplaceable on your person (or in your car) if you plan to go roaming after dark. (That said, trouble by day is virtually non-existent.) Campus police patrol the area near Loyola University around the clock, but some visitors may feel uncomfortable walking alone on Morse, Jarvis, Glenwood, Howard, and the side streets late at night. There are police cameras on the streetlights at Morse and Howard, so wave and say hello.  Wandering the beaches and parks is fine after dark, but dont go swimming after hours, particularly at the smaller beaches--certain property owners thrive on calling the cops on late swimmers. Climbing the breakwater rocks between beaches can be a lot of fun, but it is not allowed by the Chicago Park District lifeguards.</field>

		<field name="content">Both Cook Inlet and Turnagain Arm exhibit extreme tides. The only place in the world with a wider tidal range is the Bay of Fundy. Because of the swift tidal currents and the very soft clay of the tidal flats, it can be extremely dangerous to walk or drive on the tidal flats.  Both salt and fresh water in Alaska tend to be extremely cold year-round.  Swimming in the ocean is not recommended, be aware that many lakes are fed by glaciers and can also be extremely cold, even if warm in shallows near the shore. If you plan to do stream fishing wear warm clothes and waders.  Brown bears, black bears,  and moose are quite common on the peninsula.  All of them can be aggressive towards humans if surprised, provoked, or fed. Mothers with their young are the most volatile. Be aware of the possibility of encountering these animals anywhere on the Kenai, even in the middle of a city.  Moose are a major hazard on the peninsulas roadways, especially in winter. If you are traveling with a dog, be aware of the possibility of porcupines as well. In rare cases, bald eagles have been known to take small dogs and cats.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Oroville is an overall safe town.  Because most people drive, there are few if any petty crimes such as pickpocketing or mugging.  There is an underbelly of methamphetamine producers and users in the town, which tend to be focused in the area known at "South Side", roughly bounded by Lincoln, Wyandotte, and Ithaca.  Although this is an over-simplified definition, there is little reason for a visitor to go to this area, so it should be a non-issue.  The area just East of HWY 70 and between Oro Dam Blvd and Ophir road has been heavily contaminated by the chemical waste leftover from wood processing back when Oroville was a more prominent lumber town.  Needless to say, its advisable to not spend any time in this area, although again, it offers next to nothing as far as attractions unless a trip is needed to the local garbage dump for some reason.  While the area is low in humidity, the summers get incredibly hot, usually staying at a minimum of 37C/95F from June through August and sometimes peaking to 48C/120F.  This makes for great fun at the lake or on the river, but when not on the water, make sure to stay very hydrated and wear sunscreen.  On the other end of the seasons, the winters are quite cold.  While snow is extremely rare, it will often get below freezing which creates the hazard of "black ice" when driving.  Also to note is the period in late January or February when a longterm fog settles in for a week or two that is quite cold, but more importantly makes for very hazardous driving due to decreased visibility.  Make sure to take care and reduce speed as during this time there are often large pileups on the freeways of multiple cars.</field>

Dont walk at night alone, be wary of strangers, and do not draw too much attention to yourself. Also the beach in the area is prone to rip currents and man-o-war (jellyfish). Usually you will see a flag hanging at a nearby lifeguard stand telling how safe the water is. If the flag is colored green or yellow it should be safe to go in. if the flag is purple, red, or any other color you should stay out of the water.  Only swim in sight of a lifeguard stand.  Remember if you are caught in a rip current dont try to fight it. Instead swim out diagonally with the current until you are safely out of the currents grasp.      As with the rest of the USA the emergency telephone number for fire, police and rescue emergencies is 911.</field>

		<field name="content">Like all of Florida, Milton is susceptible to hurricanes.  Due to Blackwater River and Coldwater Creek running through town, the city is highly susceptible to flooding during a storm, especially in the downtown area.  Listen to radio or TV news reports, and if the area where you are is told to evacuate, do so immediately.  When evacuating from Milton, head north.  The official hurricane evacuation route is Hwy 87, and is marked with blue and white hurricane evacuation route signs.  Since this road can get highly congested during an evacuation, you can also use Chumuckla Hwy (SR 197) or Munson Hwy (SR 191), but these roads are not marked with evacuation route signs, so make sure you have a map. If you cant evacuate, and believe youre in an unsafe area, make your way to a hurricane shelter.  Hurricane shelters are designed to be nearly indestructible, and have cots, food, and water.  The first shelter to open is at the Milton Community Center, 5629 Byrom St; if needed, secondary shelters open at S.S. Dixon Intermediate School, 5540 Education Dr, and at Avalon Middle School, 5445 King Arthurs Way.  Just West of Milton is Air Products-Taminco, a fertilizer company, which works with chemicals that could be dangerous to the surrounding community.  In the event of a chemical spill at the plant, loudspeakers around the community will blare a siren, followed by a voice giving directions on what to do.  These sirens will also activate in the unlikely event of a tornado.  The sirens are tested on the first Sunday of every month, at 2:15PM.</field>

		<field name="content">Staying safe in Delaware is a matter of staying smart. In Wilmington, city officials and downtown merchants have formed (armed with two-way radios but not guns) private security patrols that wander the restaurant and entertainment districts in the downtown area to supplement the city police. Most restaurants will summon a security person to escort you to your car if requested. In the city of Wilmington it is best to apply common sense and pay attention to your surroundings(as it is anywhere); listen to your inner voice. If its telling you that youve wandered into a bad area, you probably have. In general, its best to avoid walking alone after dark in the downtown area. Interestingly enough, Wilmington has one of the highest concentrations of remote security cameras of any city its size. Of course, these cameras are best at identifying criminals after the fact, so dont take much comfort in their presence.  Despite the above advice, Delaware has less crime than most other states due to its small population.  A visit anywhere in the state is safe. Like everywhere else, common sense needs to be used.  Outside of Wilmington, there is little to worry about outside of leaving your windows down when it starts to unexpectedly rain.</field>

The city is also subject to frequent dust storms during the spring; and while not exactly dangerous, these storms are often severe enough to limit visibility. Drive with care, and give yourself a few more car lengths worth of reaction time.</field>

		<field name="content">The primary dangers in the park are from the weather.  Summer storms can bring lightning, high winds and flash floods, while the heat can cause dehydration and heat stroke.  Avoid open areas during storms, and drink plenty of water (at least one gallon per day).  Always be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions; from July through August expect afternoon monsoon thunderstorms, while from October through April expect cold temperatures and possibly snow.  High winds are also common, and can bring blowing sand that makes hiking unpleasant if not dangerous.</field>

		<field name="content">Since the Panhandle is largely rural, crime is virtually nonexistent outside of the major cities. The weather, however, does require some vigilance, as the region often experiences the widest weather extremes in the state. Panhandle winters can be surprisingly brisk, and the areas at the far north end can receive significant snowfall during the winter months. Conversely, summertime high temperatures routinely top 100ºF (38ºC). Pack and dress accordingly.  Also, the Panhandle is at the tail end of Tornado Alley. It is wise to pay attention to weather reports during the spring storm season, which runs generally from March through early June.</field>

		<field name="title">Point Reyes National Seashore</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Possibly the most dangerous hazard in the park, a sneaker wave is an unexpectedly large wave that is higher, stronger and reaching farther up the beach to levels far beyond where the normal waves reach. There have been several incidents of visitors to Point Reyes being caught by sneaker waves and drowned. Sneaker waves also have the ability to toss around large driftwood logs that may fall on a person, injuring or even killing them.  Sneaker waves can occur at any time, day or night, during incoming and outgoing tides, during storms and during sunny calm weather; they are often preceded by a sudden lowering of the water level.  An additional danger comes from rip currents, which are channeled currents of water flowing away from shore that can easily drag strong swimmers out to sea.  If you are caught in a rip current, remain calm and swim along the shoreline in order to escape the outgoing current.  Once out of the current, swim towards shore.  Another park danger is from hypothermia.  The coastal water temperatures at Point Reyes rarely exceed 50°F, and prolonged exposure to these temperatures can result in hypothermia (abnormally low body temperature) or death. Do not stay in the water for more than a few minutes unless you are wearing a wetsuit. Do not wait until you start to shiver or for your lips to turn blue before you get out of the water; if you start to shiver, you are already suffering from mild hypothermia.</field>

Carjackings, vandalism to cars and auto thefts do occur, and while the chances of being a victim are slim (though still higher than the MO and national averages), visitors should not allow the "small town" atmosphere of this city trick them into letting down their guard with regard to locking autos and hotel doors, leaving cars running unattended, paying attention to surroundings, etc.  The Square area is relatively safe during daylight and evening hours.  The west side, particularly the portion west of Sterling Ave., is not known to be particularly safe at night, especially along Blue Ridge Blvd. between 23rd St. and U.S. 24.  Avoid anything west of Sterling Ave. at night if possible.  Since there are no hotels, restaurants or tourist attractions in this part of town, this should not be hard for visitors to do.</field>

Duluth has growing reports of all of preceding issues. Females are in better safety when walking with someone they trust completely. It is highly recommended that nobody follows people they do not know in any city including Duluth. Use common sense. Do not take food, drinks (including alcohol) or drugs from a stranger or from anyone you have not known for very long. When traveling, do not leave any items that can be quickly converted to cash in plain view in cars or unattended at restaurants and other public areas. These crimes can and do occur in all areas, especially where you would have your guard down.</field>

		<field name="content">The Rutgers College campus, located in the City of New Brunswick, is generally safe for visitors and students. The Rutgers University Police or RUPD is a very noticeable presence in the city. If you have trouble, approach one of the officers (made clear by their red uniforms) and theyll be more than happy to help you. However, like most college cities, New Brunswick has its share of social problems. Homeless beggars hang out on George Street and near Rutgers bus stops, and will ask for money. Accept it as a by-product of a college town, which attracts visitors and money. However, the homeless are not aggressive and will leave you alone if you say "no." The most common crime is theft. Keep your belongings close to you, especially wallets, phones, and iPods.  Also, keep in mind that while some areas of New Brunswick are safe during the day, certain neighborhoods are dodgy and unsafe at night. Dont wander around alone at night, especially beyond Samson Street and frat row. Certain streets near Rockoff Hall should also be avoided late at night. Muggings do occur, mostly after midnight, and both males and females should travel in a group to stay safe.  On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, drunken behavior is rampant. If aggressively confronted in a bar or on the streets, simply walk away.</field>

It is a thing of beauty to watch the feast that ensues when a pack of dragonflies descends on the mosquitoes annoying you at your campsite.) Additionally the only way out other than boating is by puddle jumper (i.e. small airplane) which is typically only used in emergency situations.  Standard radio frequencies are monitored by park rangers and several other base locations, so it is recommended to carry a radio transmitter. The area is inhabited by bears. They are unlikely to bother you if you stick to the campsites and trails, but a "bear-bag" should be used when you camp as a precaution - having your food stolen in the BWCAW is not a good thing!</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Crime and other hazards in Boston are low for a major American city.  Some neighborhoods (especially Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester) are more dangerous than average, and extra care should be taken there.  It is even better to avoid walking in these areas at night if possible.  Also avoid public parks after dark (except for special events).  Dangers related to alcohol consumption are not uncommon, such as fights and drunk driving. Be especially careful when there is a Red Sox and New York Yankees baseball game in progress. Wearing Yankees gear in any part of town (even if youre not from NY), especially in the Fenway area, is invitation to be verbally harassed by the locals. For example, instead of the usual "Yankees Suck" phrase, you might be told that you suck!. Although generally harmless and in good fun, it is not unheard of for these encounters to escalate into physical altercations, especially when there is excess alcohol consumption involved. If you find yourself in this situation, you might find it wise to walk away and/or leave the area rather than try to hold your ground.  Care should be taken as well if you decide to go clubbing on Landsdowne Street, the Theatre District, Chinatown, or Faneuil Hall.  As mentioned above, the more dangerous parts of Boston are generally not visited or even seen by tourists, but there are a few mildly dangerous locales that you should be aware of if you plan on enjoying Bostons nightlife.  In Kenmore Square, be especially careful on Landsdowne Street as muggers and pickpockets are becoming more common and also eat in the darker areas near Ipswich Street at the end of the strip.  In Chinatown, be very careful if you wander off Kneeland Street.  There are a plethora of little alleyways and inlets where muggers operate.  Faneuil Hall is generally safe, but not without its share of fights and petty robberies.  The safest place to have a night on the town in Boston is definitely Boylston Street in the Back Bay, around the Prudential Center area.  There are plenty of bars, pubs, clubs, and restaurants that cater to the college, professional, and upscale crowd, greatly reducing the likelihood of crime.  Also, this area is within short walking distance from most of the major hotels in the city.  Still, Boston is a reasonably safe city known more for its schools and history than for its crime, petty or otherwise.  Bostons subway system, the MBTA, is generally safe compared to other major cities. Green Line trains and the northern half of the Red Line are mostly used by college students and young professionals moving to and from the immediate suburbs.  Caution is still advisable late at night, especially when leaving the station or the train.  If there is an emergency, dial 911, a free call, from any telephone for police, medical, and fire services.</field>

While it is somewhat rare for tourists to experience tornadoes, severe thunderstorms containing frequent lightning, strong winds, hail and heavy rains are common during the spring and summer months as well. When weather conditions deteriorate listen to local radio stations for information ("Weather Radio Information" roadsigns are fairly common on interstates) The northern areas of this region are susceptible to blizzards and bitter cold temperatures during the winter; while southern regions sometimes face severe ice events. When driving cross-country in the winter, be prepared as Interstates often close during severe winter weather events.</field>

		<field name="content">Tropical weather   can be a hazard, especially during the Atlantic hurricane season from June 1 to November 30.  In the event of an approaching hurricane or tropical storm, pay attention to television and radio news alerts, who will tell you what to do and what to expect.  Typically when a hurricane is imminent, people staying at beaches, low-lying areas, and trailer homes will be asked to evacuate further inland.  If your area is asked to evacuate, do so immediately, before traffic slows to a crawl; the most dangerous place to be in a hurricane is stuck in traffic.  Hurricane-safe shelters, built inside public schools, will be opened to anyone who needs them.  Theft and crime are minor problems in Pensacola, and youll be safe if you stick to the main tourist areas.  Avoid the area of Pensacola known as Brownsville, on Highway 90 from D Street to Mobile Highway; although the sheriffs office has tried to curb crime in this area, drugs and prostitution still make it a dangerous area to linger in.  Traffic in Pensacola is tame compared to large cities, but some roads have a reputation for being especially dangerous.  Be careful when driving along Gulf Beach Highway; the narrow road, with chronic speeders and blind corners claims a half-dozen lives a year.  I-110 is under heavy construction, and speeding here is not only dangerous, its very likely to earn you a traffic ticket.  I-10 through Pensacola is notorious for being a speed trap; remember that the speed limit drops to 60 MPH while in the Pensacola area, not 70 MPH like it is in neighboring counties.</field>

Drownings occur every year, usually as people foolishly try to go wading in what looks like calm water, and are promptly sucked under by the strong current. (Do not be deceived: there is a rapid undercurrent that is often not visible from the surface.) Kayakers, rafters, and canoers would do well to consider this fact as well.</field>

Visitors to the park can get more information about the parks bears in any of the parks Visitor Centers.  Snakes Twenty-three (23) types of snakes make their home in the parks lands, but only two varieties are venomous: Timber Rattlesnakes and Copperheads.  Rattlesnakes are part of the pit-viper family and sport a distinctive rattle at the end of their bodies that makes a buzzing sound when the snake is agitated.  The Copperheads account for most of the snake bites in the area, however their venom is the least toxic, but this does not mean you should underestimate it.  Neither snake is aggressive and if you stay away from places where they tend to sun, you should be able to avoid them altogether.  Waterfalls Do not climb on the falls. Fatalities have occurred as a result of people climbing on the falls.  Hypothermia Be cautious when in the parks streams. Even during the hotter months of the summer, many of the higher elevation streams can induce hypothermia with extended exposure.  It is a good idea to have some first-aid knowledge if you wander far into the back country, especially off trail.  Be sure to get a permit, so theyll know where to look for you if you do not show.  And as always, beware of snowstorms.</field>

For 20 days in Jan 04-Feb 04, the temp did not get above 0 deg F. The coldest temp was in Minot, ND, at -45F (-75 windchill) while Bismarck was at a "balmy" -43F. If your car has a block heater, remember to plug it into a wall outlet. Local rental cars will have block heaters installed. If you dont know what to look for, ask the rental place; they will know. Block heaters will keep the car from freezing up during sub-zero temps. From April-October, most of the state will conduct its road construction projects. During this season, plan for occasional delays in the city of Bismarck and on the roads to get to the city.</field>

		<field name="title">Bandelier National Monument</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">As at any national park, petty theft sometimes occurs, typically involving removal of things from cars.  (Lock yours.)  However, this is usually a non-problem at Bandelier and nothing to worry excessively about.  Some visitors are scared of wildlife encounters (rattlesnakes, black bear), but these too are generally non-problems, although the backcountry hiker should be attentive, particularly at dawn and dusk, and the usual advice "dont feed the wildlife" is as valid here as anywhere.  The main safety issues in the monument have to do with terrain and weather.  Bandelier is at a comparatively high elevation, ranging from about 5600 (1700 meters) at the Rio Grande up to over 8000 (2400 meters) in the mountains.  The upper reaches of the park are high enough that un-acclimated visitors can suffer from  altitude sickness , and the visitor from sea level may feel some shortness of breath and dizziness anywhere in the park.  The wise backpacker (or at least the one with some time) will spend a day or two getting acclimated to the altitude before venturing into the backcountry.  Altitude fatigue further combines with steep, sometimes vertical or overhanging, canyon walls to create danger from exposure.  People have died in the Bandelier backcountry from simply falling off a cliff.  The "Stay on the Trails" signs are there for a reason; the trails are well planned and constructed, and by staying on them you will minimize exposure hazard.  If you simply must get off-trail and go cross-country, know what youre doing (and dont do it in Frijoles Canyon, where it is illegal, at least in some areas).  The rock of the canyon walls is composed mainly of soft, friable tuff and is not suitable for rock climbing or scrambling; going off-trail to get up or down a canyon wall is a particularly bad idea.  As for weather, Bandelier is in semi-arid country and is prone to rapid and sometimes extreme variations in temperature and precipitation.  By far the most common "injury" among visitors is simple sunburn; make sure to use sunscreen and wear a hat.  If venturing into the backcountry, carry more water than you think youll need, as you will lose body water rapidly and water sources in the canyons are unreliable (and may be contaminated with Giardia parasites).  The other main hazard from weather is thunderstorms, common during "monsoon" season, usually from about mid-July through Labor Day.  Unlike the narrower "slot canyons" of Utah and Arizona, the Bandelier canyons are generally not susceptible to flash floods, although caution is still a good idea when there are storms over the mountains.  (There are exceptions: for example, a narrow and scenic section of Frijoles Canyon upstream of Ceremonial Cave should be hiked only with great caution when flooding appears possible.)  A greater thunderstorm hazard is lightning.  The mesa tops are exposed, with mainly scrub forest not much taller than you are and few places to hide.  Early starts to a hiking day are a good idea, as lightning usually does not become active until mid-afternoon.  If youre caught in a lightning storm, do not take shelter under a tree, unless you happen to be close to one of the rare thick stands of Ponderosa pines on mesa tops or at the higher elevations; instead, head for a topographic low (avoid canyon rims) and stay there until the storm passes, which usually only takes a few minutes.  It is better to see a storm coming and prolong ones stay in a canyon bottom (assuming its not so narrow as to pose a flash-flood hazard) until it passes, than to have to sprint for the canyon if the storm catches you on the mesa top.  Winter weather in Bandelier is commonly delightful in the lower reaches of the park; daytime temperatures are usually in the 40s (Fahrenheit) and sunny days far outnumber cloudy or snowy ones.  However, the winter camper should be prepared for night-time lows as cold as -10 F (-23 C), although lows of +10 F (-11 C) are more typical, at least at lower elevations.  Night-time temperatures usually drop rapidly in the few days following a snowstorm; be prepared.  Note that sunburn can easily occur in the winter owing to the altitude, so sun-screen up if youre going to be out for a while, even in December.  One other caution: bubonic plague is endemic in northern New Mexico, and its main animal reservoir is among the rodents that are plentiful in Bandelier.  If you see a small animal that appears to be distressed or dead, leave it alone; buzzards are immune to plague, you are not.</field>

		<field name="content">Montana is safer than most when it comes to violent and personal crime, but the state still suffers from one of the highest highway and road death rates in the country. Long distance travel over great amounts of time resulting in fatigue, hazardous winter road conditions, distances from emergency services, and alcohol consumption frequently contribute to the high number of deaths on Montanas highways yearly. This is not to say its unsafe to drive in Montana -- just beware. If you are unused to driving winding mountain roads or driving in extremely hazardous snow/wind/ice/rain/sleet conditions, do not do so. Wait for the weather to clear -- it may result in a good story, those 12 hours you spent at a truck stop with some friends waiting for a pass to clear.  If you do find yourself stranded in winter conditions, its important to remember two things -- first, be prepared. Always carry water, snack foods, a small first aid kit including a space blanket and a cell phone, if possible, for emergencies.  Although there is cellphone coverage along most of the highways, it can be unreliable in places, especially the numerous mountain passes.  Many rural roads have no cellphone coverage, so dont rely on always having quick emergency communication.  Second, if you become stranded, stay in your car, turn on your hazard lights, and wait for help.  There is a lot of wildlife around the state, including deer, elk, moose, bears, buffalo, and coyotes.  Always remember that these are wild, and do not tolerate people with cameras getting close, much less trying to put their kid on the buffalo.  Most animals will avoid humans by our scent or noise, although beware of deer along the roads.  When camping, always keep food in your car, or hung from a tall tree.  Tents are like tissue paper to a hungry bear.  Outside of environmental and road hazards, use common sense, and you should be fine.</field>

Be vigilant and use common sense when hiking; some parks may well have more of a population or frequency of encounters then others.  In fact, a portion of the National Forest is closed off each year to allow for the ritual snake migrations that take place there (protecting you and the snakes from harrassment). Ticks, which can carry a multitude of diseases including Lymes Disease, are also very common in the warmer months.</field>

		<field name="content">In 2010, Hartford ranked as the 19th most dangerous city in the United States. Crime is generally contained in the Northeast area of the city. Some people also report being victims of crimes after going to the Webster in the Frog Hollow area of the city. This can easily be avoided by not straying from the main road, especially at night. Most crime is gang related and the average citizen should not worry. Basically, if you are in the North end, stick to Albany Avenue (around the middle, as there is not much activity/high crime near downtown), or use a car. This area is usually fine in the day as well, but the side streets are some of the worst in the city. The south end is generally fine, especially if you stick to Main Street, Park Street, Franklin Avenue, Maple Avenue, and Wethersfield Avenue. Side streets vary, especially in the Park/Broad st areas (Frog Hollow), but these areas are conspicuous. The west end,downtown and Blue Hills are fine regardless of where you go.</field>

		<field name="content">As in most of the United States, the phone number to dial for emergencies is 911.     Pittsburgh is routinely ranked as one of the safest cities among others of comparable size in the US. Most areas of the city are safe for tourists, and most of the unsafe areas are residential, so tourists are unlikely to visit these areas. Nevertheless, the following neighborhoods should be avoided (especially at night):  CENTRAL: The Hill District, located between Downtown Oakland. EAST: Homewood-Brushton, Wilkinsburg, Lincoln-Larimar, Garfield. NORTH: Central North Side. SOUTH: Mt. Oliver, Hazelwood, Beltzhoover, Arlington Heights, St. Clair Village, Upper Homestead.   On Sundays in the fall and winter, some fans of the local football team (the Steelers) tend to be very rowdy. While the great majority wont bother you, it is suggested that out of town fans not wear the clothing of the team they are playing that day or that of their main rivals (the Baltimore Ravens) at any time. The least youll encounter is ridicule, and although assaults at sporting events are especially rare (Pittsburgh is largely a hospitable town), some incidents have occurred. It is also advisable to not wear any athletic apparel of the rival hockey team, the Philadelphia Flyers. Pittsburghers do take their sports loyalty to another level.   Whether driving, bicycling, or walking, watch out for drivers making the "Pittsburgh Left" (see  By Car , above).</field>

The only area in which a person would need to be on the look-out is downtown on the weekends, especially during the school year. With the many colleges and bars it makes for an unpredictable experience.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Ellsworth is a very safe place, with relatively little crime. However, petty theft is possible anywhere in the United States, especially in large shopping centers and during the busy summer tourist season. Realistically, your biggest risk is in driving your car. Dont drive if you drink, and always drive carefully and defensively, here and everywhere else. Ellsworth drivers are generally polite, careful drivers, but the summer season can be a crazy time on the Maine roads. If visiting Ellsworth in the winter, take special care on the slippery, snowy roads, especially if youre unfamiliar with winter driving conditions.</field>

		<field name="content">Torrance is a safe city with a low crime rate. Del Amo Mall has experienced some violent crime in the recent years, but you are unlikely to be assaulted, as long as you dont make anyone mad. Eastern Torrance is not as safe as the rest of Torrance, but again, you are unlikely to fall victim to any crime. Be careful on the Anza Ave. and Halison St. intersection. Accidents involving students from nearby middle school happen once or twice a year. Accidents are also fairly frequent on Hawthorne Boulevard, but are usually collisions with cars, and pedestrians are rarely if not never hit.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Inglewood, is actually safe, and not as dangerous as commonly believed. Since the 1992 riots, the crime rate has been dropping, and also alongside with it murders. Contrary to misconceptions, Inglewood, although has a higher murder rate than the US national average, is the least likely crime to happen, and this murder average is only just because of its size and population (which is small). Rape is only slightly higher than the national average, so dont expect rape. However, robbery and assault are extremely high, and are much more higher than the national average, which give it a higher crime rate than average. At day time, gang activity is low and police patrol the streets high. At night time, be careful of your surroundings and avoid anyone acting suspicious. Avoid large groups of people wearing gang colors, and also avoid those who are "high", or on drugs or drunk at night. Most crime happens in the central part of the city, and the outer suburbs have a lower crime rate. Be careful when in the central neighborhoods (such as the City Center or the intersection between Crenshaw and Manchester Boulevards), the areas surrounding Lennox Boulevard and Burl Avenue, 104th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard and the area between Van Ness Avenue and the Imperial Freeway. These are the areas that you will most likely encounter trouble.</field>

		<field name="title">Katmai National Park</field>
		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Grizzly Bear (catching salmon at Brooks Falls  The following guidelines will help you travel safely in bear country:  Food Storage - All food, beverages, garbage, and any other odorous items must be attended at all times. They must be stored in a bear-resistant container (BRC, or "bear barrel"). A limited supply of BRCs are available for temporary check-out, free-of-charge at Brooks Camp and at the King Salmon Visitor Center. Do not plan on hanging as a method of storage; trees are sparse in Katmai and are generally not suitable for hanging food.  Gear Storage - Keep your belongings with you: A pack or clothing left unattended invites curious bears. Not only will your belongings likely be destroyed, but the bear may also learn to associate such items with interesting smells or, even worse, food.  Be Alert - Bears are active both day and night and could be anywhere.  Make Noise - In dense stands of willow or alder and other conditions that hamper visibility, make lots of noise so bears can hear you approach. Bears may perceive you as a threat if you startle them. By making noise such as clapping, singing, or even talking loudly, you can alert a bear to your presence and it will likely choose to avoid you. Try to stay with a group when traveling in bear country. A group is noisier, easier for a bear to detect, and more intimidating than one person or two people.  Avoid Close Encounters - If you see a bear that is unaware of your presence or far away, back away slowly and quietly while keeping an eye on the bear.  Do Not Approach - The minimum recommended safe distance from any bear is 50 yards. Avoid actions that interfere with bear movement or foraging activities.  Remain Calm - A bear may approach closely or rear-up on its hind legs to identify you. Back away slowly, moving diagonally out of its path of travel. You may need to leave a trail (if available) temporarily to allow a bear to pass. If a bear follows you, stop and hold your ground. If a bear continues to approach, make noise, wave your arms, and try to appear as large as possible.  Dont Run - Running may encourage a bear to pursue you. Bears can run faster than 30 mph (50 km/hr). You cannot outrun them. If a bear is charging you, try to appear non-threatening. Stand your ground and speak to the bear in a calm voice. Bears sometimes come within a few feet of people before veering off.  If a Bear Makes Contact with You... - Play dead. Fall to the ground on your stomach with your legs apart. Lock your hands behind your neck to protect your neck and face. If you do get rolled over, keep rolling until youre face down again. Stay quietly in this position until the bear has left the area. If the attack continues long after you have assumed the protective position, fight back vigorously.  Fishing Around Bears - Remember: Bears come here to fish, too. When bear activity is at its peak, both bears and anglers compete for the same resources. Stop fishing whenever bears are close enough to see or hear you and break your line if you encounter a bear. A bear quickly learns to associate anglers and/or the splashing of a fish in play with an easy meal and can take away your fish in seconds.  A bear that has learned that humans are a good source of food may become dangerous to people in the park and in local communities outside the park. In most cases such bears must eventually be destroyed. You can prevent this by being aware of how to behave to protect yourself and the bears.  Camping Around Bears - If you are camping in Brooks Camp from June 1 through September 17, an electric fence is maintained by the park around the camp perimeter.   If you are camping in the backcountry, however, you may want to consider bringing an electric fence. Electric fences have been adapted for use in bear country and have been effective at minimizing intrusions into campsites. Typically, park staff in the field choose to use electric fences. Visitors planning to use electric fences must bring their own equipment; the park does not provide electric fencing material.</field>

		<field name="content">Always check the local weather before heading up to the mountain. It is not uncommon for chains or snow tires to be advised or required. While there are snow plows as well as other precautions, it never hurts to be on the safe side. If you are planning a hike or skiing adventure into areas less traveled it is advised to take a Personal Location Transponder. If you should become lost, injured, or trapped this device will help emergency crews to locate you quickly via a GPS signal. The technology can now locate you to within 10 feet of your actual placement, a great accessory for snow enthusiasts in avalanche zones.</field>

		<field name="content">Dialing 911 on any phone, wireless or landline, is free and will connect you with local police, fire, and ambulance services. In New York State it is illegal to use your cellular telephone while operating a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle, unless it is a hands-free phone.  Violators should expect hefty fines, although enforcement varies widely across the state.  Texting while driving is also prohibited. Deer are very common in New York and pose a threat to motorists, more so at night. Reduce your speed in suburban and rural neighborhoods at night to reduce the chance of an accident. Dont approach wild animals, especially ones that are acting unusually friendly or confused. Rabies outbreaks in animals do occasionally occur. If bitten, especially by a racoon, bat, skunk, fox or dog, seek medical attention immediately.  Upstate New York contains a few species of poisonous snakes, such as the Copperhead, the Eastern Massasauga and the Timber Rattlesnake. Although it is uncommon to encounter these snakes, seek medical attention if bitten immediately.  Also beware of the Black Widow spider, and seek medical attention if bitten.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Arlington is a generally safe town, though the areas of Dalworthington Gardens, Pantego, and the areas north of IH-30 are MUCH better developed and safer than other parts of the city.  Six Flags Over Texas, Hurricane Harbor water park, Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and the Dallas Cowboys new stadium are situated in a highly modernized, pleasant location along IH-30; as you travel immediately south from there, the area is quite industrialized and deteriorated.  One would be wise not to venture through East Arlington on foot at night.  The danger zone essentially is surrounded by IH-30 to the north, IH-20 to the south, Cooper Street/FM 157 to the west, and State Hwy. 360 to the east.  Located on the north side of IH-20, Arlingtons main shopping centers - The Parks at Arlington Mall and newly-built Arlington Highlands mall - are very safe zones that are constantly bustling with people due to all the restaurants and commerce in this area.  If you are visiting the campus of UT Arlington during the day you shouldnt run into any problems, though after hours (even before sundown) assault and robbery are not uncommon on the campus outskirts, particularly south and east of campus.  As mentioned before, West Arlington (Dalworthington Gardens and Pantego) are by far the safest areas of the city, though they are mostly residential.</field>

It is an area with high crime and drug rates.  Visitors should avoid walking the streets at night at all costs. Visitors should be familiar with the area before arriving in East St. Louis, but there are areas that are secure. Please obtain clear and precise directions before driving around East St. Louis or use the security and reliability of mass transportation.

		<field name="content">A word of caution, it is illegal in South Carolina to be grossly intoxicated in public. The police can arrest you and charge you with public disorderly conduct if they believe this is the case, and there seems to be no legal definition of grossly intoxicated for a pedestrian. This is a misdemeanor offence, resulting in a court hearing. You can get your charge expunged within the state by entering a Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) program. This involves fines, community service, drug tests, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and homework assignments and typically takes about 2 months to complete. However, the PTI program is not recognized by the Federal Government.  Most of the areas visitors would normally visit in South Carolina are relatively crime-free. However, some residential areas in large cities like Charleston may be somewhat dangerous after dark for non-locals.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The reputation of Buffalos East Side as a rough part of town can be over-exaggerated by locals, but its not entirely undeserved. The East Side is, generally speaking, the citys poorest residential district; it is bounded roughly by Main Street on the west and north, the city line on the east, and Seneca Street and the Buffalo River on the south. The Grider, Humboldt Park, and Genesee-Moselle neighborhoods suffer particularly from urban blight. That said, crime rates in Buffalo have fallen in recent years to levels not seen in half a century. What violent crime does occur on the East Side is usually drug- and gang-related and does not target tourists. Follow general precautions that would apply in any urban area—locking car doors, keeping valuables out of sight, being aware of your surroundings, etc.—and you should be fine pretty much anywhere.  Panhandlers can be found occasionally on Chippewa Street downtown and in Allentown and the Elmwood Village, though not nearly to the degree of most other cities. Aggressive panhandling is virtually unknown.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The park is a relatively safe place, but there are a few issues to be aware of.  For one, when hiking through Balconies Cave or Bear Gulch Cave, bring a flashlight; a headlamp is recommended to leave ones hands free.  The caves are dark, footing is uneven, the rock may be slippery, and ceilings can be low.  Avoid unnecessary noise in the cave which can be disturbing to wildlife and visitors.  During the summer and early fall temperatures may exceed 100°F, making sun protection and adequate water absolute necessities.  Drinking water is only available in the developed areas—there is no water available on any of the trails.  In addition, hikers should wear proper footwear to avoid slipping or twisting an ankle.  Rock climbers should remain alert for rocks that may become dislodged or equipment that may be dropped onto unwary hikers below.  Existing protection hardware is not maintained by the park and should be tested before using.  Clean-climbing practices means removing slings, etc. after use.  Be aware of advisories concerning cliff-nesting birds.  Dangers from the local flora and fauna are limited.  Poison oak can cause a nasty rash; wetter areas may have thick stands of this shrub, while hotter, drier areas tend to be devoid of this noxious native species.  Stay on trails to avoid encounters with this plant, and learn to recognize it ("Leaves of three, let it be").  Stinging nettle is another annoyance. Touching the plant will cause a burning sensation with all leaf hairs sticking to the skin.  Watch for this tall plant in moist areas such as cave entrances and along stream edges.  The only poisonous snake in the park is the Pacific rattlesnake; keep to trails, avoid heavy brush, and watch where hands and feet are placed in rocky terrain to avoid this snake.  Rattlesnake bites require prompt first aid, so keep an eye and ear out for these animals.  The last rattlesnake bite was in 1995, and the animal is protected in the park.</field>

Avoid the areas north of the civic center and west of I-65, they get dangerous quickly. All of the over the mountain villages are virtually crime free with little to fear. Downtown Birmingham is also extremely well patrolled and other than common sense against normal big city stuff (i.e. beggars asking for money), there is not much to worry about.  Birminghams historic Five Points South area is one of the most popular night/weekend spots, and it is always well patrolled at the insistence of area merchants. The areas wonderful restaurants, pubs, and dance clubs are among the attractions youll find there.   The downtown area has a supplemental bike patrol called  CAP (City Action Partnership)  to deter crime and assist visitors.

Of more concern is the PCB contamination caused by General Electrics toxic waste dumping during the middle decades of the 1900s. While much of it has since been cleaned up, there are still a few areas that are not safe for human activity. One main one is the Housatonic River, which is still dirty and contaminated; do not fish, swim, wade, etc. in the river waters or any ponds or flood plains that spring from it. The other main one is Silver Lake. While it looks cleaner and is worth driving past because the area is scenic and has many geese and ducks, it too is not safe for swimming, wading, picnicking, etc. There are a few other areas still contaminated as well, mainly around the river; basically, if you see a sign saying the area is contaminated or has PCBs, heed it. Onota and Pontoosuc offer plenty of safe water to frolic in, and theres no shortage of pretty places to walk in Pittsfield, so you wont be missing much.</field>

Each suburb also has its own police department, such as the Windsor Heights Police Department.  Des Moines is an extremely safe city during all parts of the day.  One can take the evening air without feeling nervous. Just like in all other cities with a sizable amount of people, there are areas and neighborhoods that may be more troublesome for some groups of people than others.  Visitors are likely to avoid these small pockets, however.  Pickpockets and grand ripoff schemes that plague other cities in the U.S. and across the globe are not pervasive in the area.  Still, the best thing to do is use your judgment—if you dont want attention, dont do things to draw peoples attention.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite Atlantas reputation, the city is not as dangerous as many perceive it to be. The crime rate has dropped during the late 1990s and 2000s and reached a near forty-year low in 2005. While violent crime levels are still high compared to most American cities, most of the violence is related to the drug trade, and takes place in parts of the city visitors seldom see.  Usual precautions should be taken, as in any other major city, such as not traveling alone at night and being aware of which neighborhoods are more prone to crime. In Atlanta, the southwest and southeast areas have reported the most incidents of crime; the triangle created by I-285, I-75, and I-20 in particular is a dangerous neighborhood. Car theft is exceptionally high by national standards. Outside of the perimeter, crime rates are significantly lower (except Dekalb County).</field>

Violent crime is extraordinarily rare and even women can walk around at night with nothing to fear.</field>

Avoid traveling into neighborhoods near Old 301, Palmetto, and Central Bradenton; these areas tend to have a higher concentration of crime, especially at night. Stick to the wealthier West Bradenton and Lakewood Ranch.      As always, dont walk around by yourself late at night or carry around expensive objects or large amounts of cash. Driving is normally pretty safe, however carjackings have been known to happen. If driving around at night, lock your car doors and windows. Again it is recommended to stick to major roads to avoid getting lost and ending up in a bad neighborhood.</field>

One area to be aware of is the portion of MacArthur Boulevard near the  Oakland  border. This area is next to the notorious and impoverished "deep" East Oakland, which has some of the Bay Areas highest drug trafficking and murder rates. The area between the Hayward and Ashland borders (just south of the Bayfair Center)  is reasonably safe during the day, but gets sketchy after dark. Nevertheless, San Leandro is a safe city with designated crime free zones, including the area near the Castro Valley border at Lake Chabot to the end of Estudillo Avenue (where downtown begins), near the marina, and a large portion of the Washington Manor neighborhood (including the Washington Manor Park and Pool) from Interstate 880 to Farnsworth Avenue. Due to the presence of a juvenile hall, Fairmont Drive in the citys eastern hills is heavily secured between Lake Chabot Park and 152nd Avenue. Police patrols are very frequent and security cameras are hidden on trees and fences.</field>

A common scam is a man asking for money for gas, with his family stuck at the station. Simply say no, even if theyre persistent, theyll eventually leave you alone.

		<field name="content">Most of Louisville is pretty safe (for a city its size, it has never been featured on the TV show "Cops"). Probably the least safe areas are west of Ninth Street (the Greyhound bus station is unfortunately located here). Professional scammers acting as panhandlers are common at the station, and while not terribly aggressive or rude, they are persistent. Pickpockets are also a problem, as they will often snatch belongings from the side pockets of any bags or purses you may have  In addition, several attempted muggings have occurred directly outside of the terminal, (with station security being shockingly apathetic and unhelpful in these situations, at least until the Metro Police arrive) so be very cautious. However, a daytime drive through this part of town along Portland and then Northwestern Parkway is very interesting and not dangerous at all. Areas around Churchill Downs are also relatively sketchy, but again, simply driving through in the daytime is not a risk.  The crime risk is lower east of the Highlands. Within the Highlands, crime is still low, but use caution exiting bars on Baxter Avenue if you are alone. This same advice applies to Old Louisville, only more so. Other than this, just use common sense like you would anywhere else.</field>

Although Monmouth County contains a fair deal of wildlife none of it is dangerous, poisonous, or significantly aggressive enough to cause any regular harm. Weather conditions are typically stable although some flooding does regularly occur at low sea-levels. As of January 1st 2012, the majority of the hazards caused by Hurricane Sandy have been cleared; although hikers, campers, tramps, and hobos should be aware that many trees are still unstable and large patches of forested areas and even residential parks still have branches hanging. The Police in Monmouth County are fairly friendly, and largely much like those encountered in the rest of the state, although speeding while operating a motor vehicle is taken somewhat more seriously and its enforcement is strict. Loitering is enforced more in the town centers and shopping areas then in public parks or beach areas but traveler types can often find friendly places here.</field>

		<field name="content">Waco has a reputation for a higher-than-normal crime rate for a small to medium size city.  Visitors should exercise normal caution.  That said, most violent crime occurs in residential areas, away from most areas visitors may visit.  If you do find yourself in such an area (usually for dining), use normal caution.  Drive with the doors locked, do not draw attention to yourself, and do not make prolonged eye contact (i.e. stare at other drivers).  It is strongly advised not to be at Cameron Park at night unless you are with a large group.  Waco, and Texas in general, is not frequented by pedestrians as much as a lot of other places.  If you decide to walk, be careful, as the drivers are not used to pedestrians and may not see you.  Tornadoes are not a frequent occurrence in Waco, but when they do hit, they tend to be very strong.  Do not panic if a tornado warning is issued.  If such a warning is issued, turn on the local news and keep updated.  The weatherperson will explain what cautions need to be taken, and who should take them.  If the weatherperson, any hotel staff, or public officials give you directions, follow them.  It should go without saying that you should not go outside during a tornado.  See the  Tornado Safety  section for more information.</field>

		<field name="title">Baltimore</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Sharksmdash;not the only safety hazard in Baltimore   Baltimores reputation as a dangerous city was cemented internationally by the HBO series The Wire, and this is not far from the truth. Its nickname, the "Charm City", has been updated by local cynics as the "Harm City," and you can probably find an I heart Baltimore t-shirt for sale in which the heart is made of guns and knives. An even less inviting nickname of recent years is the grisly "Bodymore." This reputation is in no small part due to its very high murder rate and its status as a major transit point for drugs. The reputation is warranted, but the average traveler should not get overly concerned. Most crime occurs between individuals that know each other, or in high crime-ridden areas of the city, in which tourists will have little reason to go to. Few if any travelers will have any experience with that isolated culture of drug and gang-related activity, where the murders are occurring. Muggings are the crime for tourists to be concerned with, however.  The areas of Baltimore that attract tourists are safe. You shouldnt worry when going to the opera, museums, aquarium, etc. The popular Inner Harbor area in particular is saturated with police day and night, as the city government relies heavily on this area to bring in locals and tourists and generate tax revenue. Some areas just north of the waterfront (downtown above the Inner Harbor around Lexington Market, and around the big public housing projects just northeast of Little Italy) can get a little dodgy after dark, and even during the day sometimes. If youre parking your car on street in the Charles Street entertainment district or even in Fells Point, dont leave anything -even trash- visible in your car, in order to deter smash-and-grab robberies. Generally, the worst annoyance for tourists and residents around downtown are the homeless and/or drug addicts, who ask for money. Most will leave you alone if they do or dont receive anything from you. But if one follows you asking for money, its best to ignore them and keep walking, as they almost always give up after a few seconds. Avoid confrontations or yelling back.  Above all, though, just exercise the usual precautions for any large city in the world: know where you are going and how you are getting there. At night, walk in groups if possible and on well-lit streets, and do not carry large amounts of money. Call a cab if the trip back at night seems beyond your comfort zone.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Florida has a high occurrence of hurricanes. You might want to check the  Hurricane safety  page if you are visiting Florida during Hurricane Season (June 1-November 30).   Watch where and when you swim. While the beaches are great they often harbor rip currents, bacteria, and jellyfish. Always check with the lifeguard stand before heading in if no one is in the water or the waves are rough. Volusia County is known for a high number of shark attacks, so be careful when surfing. Even so, the number of attacks are less than 50, with a fatal attack every 2-3 years, amongst millions of visitors and residents who swim in the ocean. Swimming near dusk and dawn is most hazardous. Never swim in the lakes or rivers unless signs tell you swimming is safe. In Florida, stagnant and slow moving freshwater often has alligators (as well as poisonous snakes). While they rarely attack humans, its best not to take your chances.    Florida has varying crime intensity from city to city. In certain parts of large cities it may not be safe to walk alone or even in small groups at night. These are the exceptions however and most of Florida is safe enough for visitors. Touristy areas rarely have violent crimes, but theft is an occasional occurrence. If the area doesnt feel safe then it probably isnt.  Only central Africa experiences more lightning than Florida. The afternoon thunderstorms in Florida produce frequent lightning, which kills many people each year and injures many more. Stay indoors during a thunderstorm and never seek shelter under a tree. Most casualties occur on golf courses, but lightning strikes everywhere. If you must go outdoors, try to stay away from tall objects such as trees. Occasionally, summer thunderstorms will bring hail, high winds, and tornadoes. While historic numbers of tornadoes in Florida are somewhat high, the overwhelming majority occur during hurricanes (Jeanne alone spawned over 200 tornadoes in Florida) and the rest during winter cold fronts and summer thunderstorms; however, 99% of them are weak (F-0/F-1). Thus, while statistics may suggest otherwise, tornadoes are not a big hazard in Florida.</field>

Certain areas are best avoided at night such as Panorama City, Pacoima, North Hills, and parts of Van Nuys, Sylmar, North Hollywood, Canoga Park, San Fernando and Sun Valley. The rest of the Valley is mostly safe, though dauntingly devoid of foot traffic after sunset (the exception is nightlife hotspots such as along Ventura Boulevard).  Law enforcement is provided by the Los Angeles Police Department in the Los Angeles city limits. Other cities have their own police departments.

		<field name="content">For emergencies in Los Angeles County, dial 911 toll-free from any phone including payphones. Note that dialing 911 from a cellphone will place you in contact with the California Highway Patrol.  Most tourist destinations within Los Angeles area tend to be fairly safe, including Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Westwood, and West L.A. However, walking at night in some areas of the city (and some suburban cities as well) should be conducted with caution; and depending on the area, in groups. If traveling by car there is little threat of being harassed day or night, provided you avoid driving around neighborhoods with blatant signs of gang activity as mentioned below.  Certain areas in or near downtown, such as Skid Row (which is where the Greyhound station is located), Pico-Union, Westlake, Boyle Heights,  South Central , Compton, Inglewood, Harbor Gateway, and Wilmington can be dangerous regardless of the time of day and should be avoided altogether when walking if possible. If traveling in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, the neighborhoods of Pacoima, Panorama City, Van Nuys, North Hills, and Canoga Park are also best avoided on foot.  Though cities such as  Detroit ,  St. Louis , and  Atlanta  have higher reported crime rates per capita than Los Angeles, these numbers can be deceiving. L.A. statistics are skewed because safe neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Westwood help balance the numbers from the very dangerous neighborhoods. If the South Central area of Los Angeles were counted as its own city, it would have the highest crime and murder rate of any city in America. Neighboring Compton, an actual independent city, currently ranks as the fourth most dangerous city in America. Luckily for Los Angeles, Comptons statistics are not counted as part of L.A.s crime data, but the cities border each other. As a general rule, you should exercise great caution if walking in the area roughly bounded by Interstate 10 on the north, Interstate 710 on the east, Artesia Blvd/Highway 91 on the south, and La Cienega Boulevard on the west. East LA also has a higher crime rate than other areas and has gang problems as well.  Both the City of Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles, unfortunately, are considered the gang capital of America. Gangs generally confine themselves to certain areas and should be of little concern to the typical traveler, who is unlikely to venture into such areas. Gangs will usually identify their territory with graffiti markings.  While most visitors to L.A. will not visit neighborhoods where gang violence is a concern, common-sense precautions apply should you become lost and end up in a bad neighborhood: remain on high-visibility roads or freeways, avoid confrontations with groups of young men, and should a confrontation arise flee immediately.  If a person who appears to be a gang member asks you where you are from, prepare to flee or to defend yourself, as that is a common gang challenge.  Use common sense on freeways to avoid incidents of road rage, which accounts for ten or so deaths per year.  Most homeless individuals are harmless; they will likely only ask you for money and if you refuse, will simply go on to the next person.  They are most heavily concentrated in Hollywood, Skid Row, and Venice Beach.  Avoid walking along Skid Row near Downtown at any time of day or night.  Minor earthquakes happen occasionally but they are almost always harmless. In the unlikely event of a major earthquake, duck and cover and stay where you are during the shaking, then go outside once the shaking stops. Buildings and other structures are unlikely to collapse. Your largest threats come from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves. Try to get under a table, desk, or doorjam to reduce your exposure to these threats. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run during the shaking.  Since the 1950s, buildings have become progressively stronger with stricter building code regulations and research.  Most buildings built after 1978 are completely safe in the unlikely event of a major earthquake during your visit.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">The main hazards in the Sangre de Cristos are altitude and weather.   Altitude sickness  is common among visitors from sea level who have not taken the time for some acclimatization in the valley.  Two or three days spent in Santa Fe or Taos (or even the lower Albuquerque) before heading into the mountains will reduce your chances of troublesome or even serious illness.  The primary weather-related issues are hypothermia and lightning.  Freezing rain (or snow) can fall on the summits at any time of year; backpackers in the high country should have down or synthetic sleeping bags good for temperatures of 20 F (-7 C) in the summer.  Good rainwear is a must, particularly in July and August.  Thunderstorms at these times make the high summits decidedly unhealthy places to be after about 1 p.m., and can form considerably earlier in the day.  Some care should be taken when visiting the small towns around the mountains.  Several of the villages on the west side (e.g. Chimayo, Cundiyo, Truchas) lie along a major "pipeline" for narcotics coming into the United States from Mexico, and the villagers do not take kindly to outsiders poking around in places where they dont belong.  There have also been ethnic tensions between the predominantly Hispanic residents of these towns and Anglo visitors.  These often are manifested in trouble in bars, for which reason there is no "Drink" entry in this article; small-town bars are simply best avoided in this region.  Vandalism of cars at campgrounds and trailheads has also been a problem.  Its wise not to drive an ostentatious vehicle to these locations if youll be leaving it unattended overnight; vandalism seems to increase in direct proportion to the value of the vehicle being vandalized.  One final note: northern New Mexico has an unfortunate and well-deserved reputation for problems with drunk drivers, and its a definite problem in this area.  Drive suspiciously, and if you must park along a roadside at night, get as far off the road as possible, as fatal encounters between intoxicated drivers and pedestrians are all too common.</field>

The city of Erie is served by the Erie City Police Department, while Millcreek is served by the Millcreek Township Police Department. All ambulatory services are served by EmergyCare.  Erie, for the most part, is safe, and an average tourist will have no problems with violent crime, especially in Millcreek, where the mall and other shopping areas are. The East Side, especially near lower Parade Street, can be more urban and rough, but the people are mainly working class immigrants for the most part, and will not cause a problem. Near the General Electric plant near Harborcreek, however, the depressed, formerly industrial neighbourhoods can breed much in the way of criminal activity; its recommended that a tourist avoid these areas, although these areas do not offer much in the way of what a visitor would wish to see to begin with.  Perry Square in Eries urban core has multiple bars that are frequented on weekends by both rowdy college kids from Gannon and middle-aged professionals; one must be extremely careful when driving downtown overnight, especially after final call at 1:30 AM.  Other than these notes, one should just use common sense; avoid flashing expensive articles while in thickly populated areas such as downtown Erie.</field>

		<field name="content">Albuquerque has an average crime rate compared to some other American cities, but most of it is property crime of more concern to residents than to visitors.  Central Avenue is home to some of Albuquerques main attractions, but portions of it can be somewhat dangerous after dark. The section from the train tracks (eastern edge of downtown) to University Blvd. can be a little scary in the evening.  Even in Downtown, while Central Avenue is passable, smaller nearby streets such as Copper Street can be scary after dark. The Nob Hill/UNM district (between University and Carlisle) is perfectly safe at night, but Central gets progressively seedier east of Carlisle, and can get quite scary around the Fairgrounds. Consider the bus or a cab through these areas after the sun goes down.  Due to its size and mild climate, the streets of Albuquerque are considered home to many people. While not typically a danger, do expect to meet up with beggars and vagrants, particularly around UNM.  If youre going to be engaging in outdoor recreation (even as laid-back as watching an Isotopes day game), slather on the sun screen.  The elevation of the city is 5000nbsp;ft or higher, and there is usually not much cloud cover, so one can get a bad sunburn in surprisingly short order.  Also, New Mexico is very arid.  That, and its high altitude results in very low humidity in both summer and winter, which can lead to dehydration.  Drink plenty of water. A common complaint among visitors from lower altitudes is a persistent headache, which is often mistaken for altitude sickness, but is really a common symptom of dehydration. Consider carrying a water bottle and drinking frequently throughout the day if you dont already.  Be forewarned about New Mexican cuisine; if youre not used to green chile, go easy at first.  Many first-timers have tried to eat the hottest chile they could find, only to discover six hours later that it was MUCH hotter than they remembered.  Be prepared.</field>

		<field name="content">Outside of Greater Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and the Lehigh Valley, crime is not a major problem in Pennsylvania. Gang activity is high in the larger cities,  Philadelphia ,  Pittsburgh ,  Allentown  and  Reading . You know you are in a rough area when you see graffiti, abandoned houses and vehicles, and shoes tossed over telephone wires, known as shoefiti, to mark that drugs are for sale. Street drag racing and prostitution are also problems in the states urban areas.  As with most locations in the United States, a major cause of injury and death in Pennsylvania comes from automobile accidents. Drivers can be down-right hostile on some of the more notorious urban freeways, such as the Schuykill  Expressway in Philadelphia (usually its a parking lot anyway), route 22 in Allentown, the 376 in Pittsburgh and on the Interstate 95 corridor in the southeast section of the state. The roads in Pennsylvania are notoriously bad, so be careful.  Road rage can be a problem during rush hour, so if you arent familiar with the highway system, stay out of the left hand lane.  The key to safe driving is to stay defensive, you are in unfamiliar areas and while you may feel wronged, it may be the norm.  Motorcyclists are not required to wear helmets in Pennsylvania, but it is still advised.  Rural mountain roads can sometimes be steep, and impassable in times of heavy snowfall. In many parts of the state, especially around Pittsburgh, steep cliffs reside next to major roads, and rock slides can occur, though rare. When traveling in the central to western part of the state, it is best to stay on main roads and highways. If youre canoeing, skiing, or doing any other outdoor activity, take necessary precautions.  Be sure to stay out of abandoned mines and quarries. As this industry falls out of the states economy, mines and quarries are left abandoned. If you explore one, you risk the dangers of unstable supports, unstable ground, rats, snakes and other animals, forgotten explosives, blasting caps, explosive methane gas, and pockets of "blackdamp" or air without enough oxygen to support life.   Exploring the woods alone can be dangerous, due to the large deer and other wild animal population. Use insect repellent to avoid disease, wear long clothing, and do not wander onto someones property.  Flooding and snow are the most common natural disasters. Flash flooding can be a problem. Tornadoes are rare but experienced, and earthquakes are almost unheard of. Hurricanes coming up the Atlantic can strike, so be prepared. Temperatures in the summer can reach 100 degrees in places, so bring water and sunscreen. Thunderstorms are common in the summer.  If you are not from Pennsylvania you can buy any 1.4g (Class C / Consumer Grade) fireworks from an outlet for transport out of state, however, Pennsylvania residents can only purchase "Safe and Sane" fireworks (those that do not leave the ground or explode) without a permit.  All brick and mortar stores will have additional information, but tents and other temporary sales locations may or may not have correct information. Local laws vary greatly and many campsites prohibit their use outright, so you will need to check before you use them in-state. Fireworks stores and tents tend to be located in border areas but can be found throughout the state.  You do not need a permit to carry a firearm openly throughout the state, except in the city of  Philadelphia . Gun laws are fairly loose compared to other states.  Drugs, including marijuana are illegal in Pennsylvania.  In  Philadelphia , the punishment for under 30 grams is only a $200 fine.  Elsewhere, you can expect a heightened punishment.  During periods of hunting season, persons entering the woods are advised by the PA Game Commission to wear "blaze orange".</field>

		<field name="content">Although Byron is a largely listless...er, peaceful metropolis, it does come with its share of dangers.  In recent years there has been much ado in the Pulitzer-winning publication The Byron Review about a rough-and-tumble gang setting down roots in Byron.  The young gangsters, variously referred to as the Byron Thugs (B. T.) or the Gangster Disciples (G. D.) (all very B. A.), have been reported to spray paint playground equipment with their initials and ride skateboards in public parking lots.  Although the specifics of their gang-attire remain unknown, it is probably best if tourists simply avoid all punk-looking 10- to 14-year-olds while vacationing in the area.</field>

Palo Altos downtown is home to a small number of homeless people and beggars, but they are much less visible than their counterparts in Berkeley.  To the north of Palo Alto, the city of East Palo Alto and the unincorporated area of North Fair Oaks suffer from high crime rates and should be avoided or traversed quickly.  Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area.  There is a high rate of Lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area.  If a bulls eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical assistance and treatment with antibiotics.</field>

		<field name="content">Although Flagstaff is well within the southern half of U.S., it receives more snowfall than just about any other American city. Always come prepared in wintertime.  There is not a huge crime problem, but certain areas noted below should be avoided, mainly at night.    Sunnyside, one of Flagstaffs larger neighborhoods, is on the east side of town (bordered by Cedar Ave. on the north, 4th St. on the east, Izabel St. and Cedar Hill on the west and Route 66 on the south). Sunnyside is an incredibly diverse and interesting neighborhood but is also one of the most poverty stricken neighborhoods in the city. Most points of interest are restaurants located on the edge of the neighborhood in the business districts which are generally safe any time of day. The area has been inflicted with some gang activity, mostly in the very center of the neighborhood. Just dont walk the neighborhood at night or hang out in an area that seems unsafe.  The other area that becomes unsafe at night is some areas of what locals call the "South Side". South of the railroad tracks, west of Lone Tree Road, east of Milton and north of the NAU campus is the general designation of this area. The exception being most of the areas along South Beaver St. and South San Francisco St., which are safe even at night because the night-time music, restaurant and bar scene that takes place along these streets. Areas closer to campus and on side streets such as South OLeary and South Fontaine should be avoided at night. Though a lot of college students inhabit the area, drug addicts and transients do also, along with some gang activity.</field>

In fact, Patersons crime rate is comparable to that of mid-sized Midwestern cities, such as Grand Rapids, Michigan.  That said, one should exercise ordinary caution when visiting the city. Most of the crime in Paterson is in certain sections: Wrigley Park (4th Ward), Northside, and parts of Riverside, Totowa Section and Sandy Hill. It is best to avoid drug areas such as the 4th Ward or Northside. Most crime in Paterson is said to be drug related. Areas such as Downtown, Eastside Park, the Manor Section, and the Falls District have little to no crime, but it is still wise to keep a watchful eye and call the police if you feel threatened.</field>

		<field name="content">Crime can be high in certain parts of Southern California, particularly in parts of the Los Angeles area or parts of the Inland Empire area; however, the media tends to exaggerate this sometimes. Many areas are extremely good and safe, and Los Angeles, being a large diverse city, has many affluent, and middle-class areas, as well as struggling neighborhoods. Some tourists may suffer respiratory problems due to the pollution in the air closer to Southern Californias major metropolitan areas. Drink plenty of fluids and keep outdoors activities within the city itself to a minimum. There are some animals you may want to be aware of in Southern California. There are rattlesnakes in the open spaces. Its not likely you will run into one, but if you do, they typically will not bother you if you dont bother them. Even so, its best to always be alert while hiking. Mountain lions (also known as pumas, cougars, and catamounts) exist in National Parks and open spaces in Southern California. These cats are, however, shy and elusive. Although it has happened, you have very little chance of being attacked by one, let alone seeing one. Most hikers who have been hiking these areas their whole lives have never seen a mountain lion, but attacks do happen every few years or so. Make sure to always hike with another person, especially near dawn and dusk. Bears are in the mountains of Southern California and they have been known to wander into the neighborhoods of SoCal cities, mainly the cities that border the vast mountains. Its not very common, but one should be on the lookout, again if walking at dawn or dusk, especially in the cities that border the mountains.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">While Philadelphia is a city that struggles with crime, its important to remember that the places visitors are likely to spend time in are quite safe and well policed.  Center City and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods in particular have low crime rates. Wealthier neighborhoods, like Rittenhouse Square, Old City and Society Hill, are safe, as are most central districts, including the majority of Northeast Philadelphia, the Art Museum Area, Chinatown, the Parkway, and Bella Vista. Some personal crimes (break-ins, muggings, burglary, assault) happen but much less often than the media suggest. On the flip side, violent crime is sometimes censored with the influence of developers and their PR companies. Northern Liberties is widely known to be a safe and hip area, but violent crime is very real even with the gentrification process.   Other parts of the city still struggle with crime. Violence is generally concentrated in the north central, west, and southwest portions of the city, and also to some extent in Powelton Village between Drexel University and the Philadelphia Zoo (though the latter location has seen some improvements). It is not wise to walk too far off Broad St. (PA Route 611) in North Philly around the Temple University area.  Philadelphia has a lower crime rate than tourist-friendly cities such as Chicago, Washington D.C, and New Orleans.  As of December 2009, the homicide rate had dropped 20% over the previous year, continuing a trend of reduced violence in the city.  Also, be careful of traffic when crossing at major intersections—in Philadelphia, as in many major cities, one must always walk, cross, and drive defensively. The winding Schuylkill expressway provides some beautiful views, particularly around Boathouse Row, but do not try to enjoy them from your car; with the high speeds, the river on one side, and jagged rocks on the other, this is a sure way to cause an accident.  Although it is blown out of proportion at times, Philadelphia sports fans have earned a reputation as a very passionate and notorious bunch. It is advised to be extra vigilant when attending a major sports match at the Sports Complex, particularly those who have the courage to wear the opposing teams gear in hostile territory. For these fans, it is best not to provoke the Philadelphia faithful and take their jabs in stride, as fans have been assaulted and even seriously injured in fights in and around the Sports Complex and around town.</field>

Unfortunately, Downtown Richmond, most of the city, primarily the Iron Triangle and Central Richmond, is a whole different story.  These regional segments of Richmond (75% of the citys area) are the reason behind its horrible reputation, ranking with  Compton  as the worst cities in California statiscally when it comes to crime rate.  Travelers that must traverse these parts of town should know their way around and stay on the major thoroughfares through here, such as MacDonald Avenue, 23rd Street or Cutting Boulevard, without stopping here for anything or any reason.  Do not enter North Richmond at any time for any reason, lest you be riddled with bullet holes.</field>

		<field name="content">Providence is not known for scams or pick-pocketing so the biggest issues are drug and gang violence. If you do not use drugs then you should not have any issues. It is best to stay East of the highway 95 North with the exception of Federal Hill and a few other notable places, most of the poverty lies on the West end of the City.  Providence is a relatively safe city for its size, though proper caution and common sense should not be abandoned.  The downtown area can be dodgy at night, especially around Kennedy Plaza and Washington Street.  The club areas on the outskirts of downtown have also been known to draw some issues, though most are gang related. Another area to avoid at night is the Camp Street area of the East Side. There is some known gang activity and there has been some violent behavior in the past.  Also, late nights on Federal Hill are a great place to watch to drunken idiots beat each other up under the guise of Italian pride (though this is more in the vein of "Jersey Shore" Italian and not of that that first inhabited the city decades ago), so exercise caution whilst in the bar and club area of this historic neighborhood.  As far as violent crime goes, it is best to avoid South Providence and the Olneyville neighborhoods of the city.  There is little reason for most tourists to go to these locations, though the citys three main hospitals are relegated to the South Side.  Olneyvilles New York System was featured on Food Networks "Best Thing I Ever Ate" series, and while there are two other locations within driving distance of Providence (Rhode Island is the smallest state, after all), a quick visit here to get a few hot dogs will not result in a problem unless you decide to walk around the neighborhood a bit and its 1:00 in the morning.</field>

If going out to the deserts always take plenty of water (at least one gallon per person, per day) and sunscreen as well as light clothing.  Let people know where you are going and when you expect to get back.    Always be careful and watch for lightning while hiking.  Its often best to hike in the early morning to avoid the possibility of hitting an afternoon thunderstorm.  If caught in a storm while hiking seek shelter as quickly as you can. Also, if you see a thunderstorm nearby while exploring the slot canyons or the rough desert terrain of southern Utah, seek high ground immediately! Flash flooding is common in these areas, even when there is not a thunderstorm overhead.  There is a great risk for avalanches after snow storms, especially outside of the boundaries of ski resorts. Stay in groups and have locator beacons.  Scam artists target Utahns frequently, and property crime is a considerable risk.  Lock up, use common sense, and store valuables and personal information out of sight.</field>

Its most important to wear insect repellent around the lake in the evening hours.  Be aware that many types of insect repellent have been proven to be toxic, carcinogenic, and cause birth defects, and many on the market have not been tested.  Just because it says natural on the label does not mean it is safe.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite the fact that Buffalos crime rate has fallen steadily since the 1990s, it is still higher than the national average for cities its size. That being the case, North Buffalo is generally among the lowest-crime areas of the city. In particular, for a district with as active a nightlife scene as Hertel Avenue, the bars are laid-back and draw a much more sophisticated crowd than the Chippewa strip, and drunken violence is nearly unknown.   University Heights is an exception to this rule, with a crime rate that is above average even by Buffalo standards. The bars there, while far fewer in number than those on Hertel, are noticeably rowdier and grittier. However, crime in University Heights is mostly characterized by muggings and home burglaries, with violent crime comparatively rare. The area near the corner of Hertel Avenue and Military Road (far to the west of the Hertel Avenue strip) is another minor area of concern. The same as any urban area, visitors to any part of North Buffalo should use common sense—lock car doors, keep valuables out of sight, keep your wits about you in general.  Compared to other crowded shopping and dining areas, Hertel Avenue is almost completely free of panhandlers—this author would be hard-pressed to name a single time he has been solicited for spare change on Hertel. Beggars do turn up occasionally in University Heights, especially the closer you get to the University Metro Rail Station, but even there the situation is nothing like the Elmwood Village or Allentown. If you do encounter a panhandler, there is little to fear—they are rarely aggressive. If you dont want to give, a firm "no" almost always suffices.</field>

		<field name="content">As with nearby New York City, New Havens crime rate has gone down considerably since the early 1990s, and it is now considered to be a safe city, at least in the downtown area.  Today, there is very little risk involved with traveling to New Havens tourist attractions as streets bustle with crowds generated by hundreds of restaurants, cinemas, theaters, cafes and stores. Luxury apartments and million-dollar condominiums have proliferated, adding a large population base to formerly industrial or commercial zones. In such areas, the downtown area is generally safe at night, but like other cities, late night travel through certain city neighborhoods outside the downtown, without someone who knows the area, is not recommended.  When visiting, exercise the same precautions you would use in any large city.  It is not recommended to venture outside the Metro North stop at Union Station at night. Taxis wait near the doorway, and it would be wise to take advantage of them if you must arrive in New Haven during the evening. The surrounding area is poorly lit and the surrounding area has seen a variety of violent and non-violent crime.</field>

		<field name="content">If you choose to go hunting always wear a bright color to stand out from the surroundings as hunting accidents can occur.  Pennsylvania State law mandates at least a total of 250 square inches of fluorescent orange on the front and back of the body, or alternatively a hat that is completely fluorescent orange when hunting deer or bear.  Always remember to use common sense when hunting!  Many attractions that draw people to the Pocono region can be dangerous.  When participating in whitewater rafting, water skiing, or boating, a U.S. Coast Guard approved life jacket is a good idea.  Helmets are recommended for skiing and snowboarding.  Also, use care when hiking as some areas have steep drop offs.  When camping, never leave food outside for extended periods of time, as this can attract raccoons, opossum, and especially bears.  Although Black Bears are much more docile that most other bear species, they can be dangerous.  Never get between a bear and its young, and keep in mind that bears can often be scared off by loud noises.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Given the citys lure of easy money and "Sin City" reputation, Las Vegas naturally attracts a lot of unsavory characters, as evidenced by its rather high violent crime rate: 763.4 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants in calendar year 2010 (according to the FBIs Crime in the United States report).  This is substantially higher than big cities like Los Angeles and New York, where the comparable numbers were 442.6 and 391.9 in 2010.  Naturally, the crimes that drive Vegass numbers so high are robbery and aggravated assault.  Be vigilant and do not leave any valuables visible in your car. If you are lucky enough to win a large jackpot, you can ask the casino to hold your winnings in its safe or to pay you with a check so that you are not walking out the door with a large amount of cash. If you insist on receiving all your winnings in cash, all casinos have security personnel available to escort you to your car or room upon request.  Like most large tourism destinations, the Strip has its share of pickpockets and purse snatchers, so keep your wallet in a front pocket or keep a tight hold on your purse.  Major casinos are generally very safe.  Casinos take security very seriously and have cameras recording almost every square inch of their property, as well as uniformed and plainclothes security personnel patrolling at all times.  Make sure your hotel door is closed safely at night and use the deadbolt if one is provided. If there is knocking on the door at night, dont open it unless you are sure of the good intentions of the persons that knocked. They might just be drunk, but there could be more serious trouble. Remain calm and call security when necessary.  Numerous people along Las Vegas Boulevard will attempt to hand you fliers advertising adult entertainment or prostitution services. Simply ignore them and they wont harm you, although they are profoundly annoying.</field>

		<field name="main">stay safe</field>
		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Like most cities in America, there are certain areas of Orlando which are more dangerous than others. Some areas travelers should be cautious of are: Parramore District, area in downtown Orlando is a location where a lot of the areas homeless population congregates and crime rates are higher in this area.  Orange Blossom Trail, north of Sand Lake Road is known to be a a bit of an unofficial red light district. Drug and prostitution related crime is common here. Prostitution is not legal in Orlando, so you could spend a night in jail if you decide to indulge. Pine Hills, located around Silver Star Road and Pine Hills Road west of John Young Parkway. This is a lower income area that has struggled with high crime rates. The Greyhound bus station is in Pine Hills and is a place to use caution.  While it is unlikely that any one individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.  While crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions  are particularly important in an area like Orlando.    Never leave valuable items in your car unattended, and get any purchased items to your hotel room as soon as possible. Consider utilizing the hotel room safe.  Never leave small children unattended for any length of time, especially at a pool. Most hotel pools do not have lifeguards.  Hotel room invasions do occur, especially open-air hotel and motel rooms when the victim leaves their hotel room unlocked and not dead-bolted. When you are in a hotel room, always lock your doors behind you, even if you expect someone in a minute or two.  While hurricanes attract most of the attention, the proximity to two coasts also brings frequent, and sometimes dangerous, thunderstorms. These occur nearly every day during the rainy season from mid-June through September. While some days it may only rain for 10 minutes, other thunderstorms can last for hours and its not unheard of for one location to remain dry while another spot 10 miles away gets a couple inches of rain on an afternoon. The summer thunderstorms are the main reason that Florida is the lightning capital of the western hemisphere. During these storms it is best to remain indoors due to the danger posed by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Golfers are especially vulnerable. A couple of dozen people are killed each year by lightning in Florida and many more spend much time receiving treatment for lightning strikes.  Pets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Most places to accommodate service animals, however. Also note above about interior temperatures in parked cars.</field>

If you are uptown, the biggest worry is auto theft/break-in, which is hardly rampant. Violent crime is relatively rare in the central district, as well as the affluent southern side of town. The most dangerous areas are the west and east sides.   Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police (CMPD) almost always maintain a visible presence in crowded areas. If you have trouble, look for an officer. Note that in certain parts of the city the police are deployed on bikes as well as cars.</field>

In 2008, the city of only 71,000 people had 54 murders.  Dont wander past the riverfront and Rutgers areas along with the block of the Susquehanna Bank Center.  During the day, the riverfront and downtown areas are safe, provided that you dont flash your valuables. The Rutgers and Camden police are also highly present. Approach them if you have any concerns. However, do NOT wander around alone at night. It is DANGEROUS. The downtown area is nearly empty after the Court House, Rutgers University, and other major businesses close down for the evenings. Keep in mind that the drug trade fuels a lot of Camdens crime. Even if you dont experience violent crime at night, policemen will be curious about why a tourist is wandering alone on the streets and you may be subjected to questioning.  The city is one of the poorest in the country.  Unemployment is over 17%, and the poverty rate  38.6%.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Omaha is generally a safe city, but still use common sense. Simply using caution and avoiding any situation in which you are uncomfortable will basically keep you out of trouble. The vast majority of violent crime occurs in North Omaha, roughly defined as the area North of Lake St, between 24th and 72nd St. Exercise a bit of additional caution when in this area after dark.  Omaha is in Tornado Alley, so severe weather can erupt between the months of April and August with the main threats being hail, high winds and street flooding, but tornadoes can sometimes be a threat. Tornado alert sirens are located throughout the city. At 11 A.M. on the first Wednesday of the month, the sirens are tested. If in doubt, ask a resident. Local stations KETV Channel 7 (ABC), WOWT Channel 6(NBC) and KMTV Channel 3(CBS) break into programming if a severe weather event is in progress. Radio services 1110AM and 590AM also provide severe weather coverage. Be aware that Omaha is within Douglas County in the state of Nebraska, as meteorologists often point out warnings this way.  During winter months, Omaha often sees cold temperatures as well as snow or ice events. Also, be aware that steep hills do exist within the city, and precaution should be taken during slick driving conditions.  Blizzards are often possible, the entire city normally shuts down during one of these.</field>

		<field name="content">Red Sox fans have a reputation as rowdy and boisterous (and often aggressive), but this often overstated. Fans of opposing teams will find their Bostonian counterparts to be mostly good-spirited. However, fans of rival team the New York Yankees are likely to hear chants of “Yankees Suck” after a game between the two, and as in all situations, alcohol can be an aggravating factor. Avoiding unnecessary confrontations with particularly aggressive Boston fans is well-advised.  Fenway Park is a major tourist destination in Boston, so the surrounding area is mostly well policed and marked. However, like other cities, some general rules still apply. At night, walking with a companion or group is preferable. Bostons more dangerous neighborhoods (Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan) contain no tourist attractions, and are sufficient distance from the park that you wont have to worry about crossing over into them. Similar to other destinations which attract large amounts of people, petty theft can become an issue around Fenway - being aware of your surroundings will help to reduce the chance that an opportunistic thief will “relieve you” of your property. The crime rate in Boston is lower than most comparably sized cities, although still higher than in the surrounding suburbs.</field>

During your visit, you will probably need to take only basic safety precautions. Most amenities for visitors can be found in and around the hotels and shopping districts, including Old Pasadena, Playhouse District and South Lake Avenue. These areas are all located south of the 210 Freeway.  As with much of the Los Angeles area, however, there are areas that a visitor should be cautious about entering.  In large measure, Northwest Pasadena should be approached with caution, as this is the heart of Pasadenas longstanding gang-related activity.

The most significant threat to public safety comes from the high level of deer that are native to the surrounding forests. It is not uncommon to have a nighttime drive interrupted by a shocking jolt of adrenaline due to these impish mammals suddenly appearing on the side of darkened road. Constant vigilance is strongly suggested during the night in order to avoid a costly accident.</field>

Several petty thefts have occurred as well as murders, however, these incidents happen very rarely and are always isolated incidents usually involving domestic disputes.  There is absolutely no unsafe neighborhood or location in Medford, and with the mean income of a household earning over $100,000 per year, you can be sure that residents work hard to keep their neighborhoods clean and safe.  Medford Township residents are known, especially in the neighborhood of Birchwood Lakes, to contact the police at the slightest sign of suspicion.  Many lakes in Medford are privately owned by either residents or the neighborhoods themselves, and trespassing on them without permission is illegal.</field>

It is advised to take precautions to protect your car especially if you drive a model that is a frequent target of theft.    Violent crime has increased in recent years especially on the Mexican side of the border as a result of cartels competing over control of drug routes into the United States.  The Mexican military has increased its presence in the region, which has resulted in frequent firefights between various cartels and the Mexican military.  There have been occasions when innocents were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time when a firefight broke out.  One should exercise extreme caution when visiting Mexican cities such as Matamoros, Reynosa, etc.  According to the US Department of State in recent years US citizens have been victims of "homicide, gun battles, kidnapping, carjacking, and highway robbery" in Mexico.</field>

Theres almost nowhere in Akron anyone shouldnt go in the daytime, and very few places at night.  Generally, the west side of the city near Copley road is regarded as the worst section of town. With a higher rate of violent crimes and theft, it is best avoided by outsiders. Some, but not all, housing projects - most notably Joy Park project  in the vicinity of the Zoo and Elizabeth Park under the All-American Bridge - are also somewhat unsafe and should be bypassed altogether by foot and car.  If visiting the University of Akron, its best to stay west of the Market / Buchtel intersection. The near-East neighborhood of which this is the "border" (Middlebury) is not necessarily unsafe, but does have a large amount of medium-scale drug activity and the occasional assault and non-violent robbery.

Dont go out alone at night, dont flash money around and avoid the sections of town without streetlights, as crime tends to be higher there.  Although it is on the edge of Tornado Alley, Terre Haute does experience severe thunderstorms and the occasional tornado warning. Most of these occur in the spring and summer but there have been severe weather events in other months. There are sirens near Indiana State University, but they can only be heard within a mile of the campus. It is usually recommended to tune into local television or radio stations if there is a chance of severe weather.</field>

		<field name="content">Turn on your headlights.  : With just a few local exceptions, the major roads in the U.P. are two-lane highways.  Turn on your headlights during the day, and you will be more visible to oncoming traffic -- especially vehicles that are passing other vehicles.     When on the highways, be patient.  : Mix 18-wheelers, RVs, cars, and SUVs, and two-lane highways become crowded, especially along US-2, M-28, and US-41 (south of Marquette).   Fortunately, the State of Michigan has invested in passing lanes, and posted signs to let drivers know how many such lanes exist between major stops along the highways.  This is particulary true (and most needed) anong US-2.   Give logging trucks, salt trucks, and sand trucks a wide berth.  These vehicles are big, fast, and have major blindspots.   When hiking, cycling, and camping, tell someone where youre going and when you plan to return, if youre heading out into the backwoods.  Dont rely on your cell phone for contact, as cell coverage can be sketchy in the remote parts of the U.P. and varies by cell service provider.  The most dangerous situations you can encounter in the Upper Peninsula are often weather related.  :During the long winter season, major snow events and subzero temperatures are fairly common. Snowfall totals from large storms are often measured in feet, not inches, especially in the Western UP and along the Lake Superior shoreline. The counties do a good job of salting, sanding, and plowing on the main roads and highways, so give the plows and salt trucks plenty of room when you encounter them.    :As for less-traveled roads: while the locals cope very well with the snow, it is NOT a good idea to attempt to travel if heavy snows are possible. Even with a four wheel drive vehicle, you may get stuck. Pack your car/SUV/truck for such an event if you do head out! Items to include: a cell phone, blankets, food and water, a snowshovel, flares, kitty litter and snowchains for your tires.  Better yet, stay home and watch the Packers on T.V.  The U.P. has relatively little violent crime, but drunk driving and drunken snowmobiling are hazards, just as in the rest of the rural Upper Midwest. Be careful!</field>

Traveling to the neighborhoods of Far Rockaway and Edgemere at night would not be wise. Gang violence plagues the many housing projects on the peninsula, and it can be easy getting caught in the cross fire. Robberies and assaults on tourists are not very common (probably because tourists dont visit areas like Far Rockaway), but still can happen. It would be safest to avoid the public housing developments and not be caught on foot at night in the eastern most portions of the peninsula.</field>

		<field name="content">Visitors planning to explore lava tube caves need to come prepared with warm clothing, protective headgear, at least three sources of light, sturdy footwear, and leather gloves.  Do not take these warnings lightly; if you lose your light source even a short distance from a cave entrance it is extremely likely that you will become disoriented in the darkness and unable to find your way out.  Similarly, the cave floor is rocky, uneven and often slippery, making sturdy footwear is an absolute necessity to avoid foot and ankle injuries.  Sturdy hiking boots are required when hiking on lava terrain and daypacks with water, snacks, raingear, first aid kit and sunscreen are suggested.  The heat while on lava flows can be intense, so plan on drinking at least one gallon of water per person per day.  In addition, be aware that progress over lava flows is slow, that lava is sharp and can easily tear apart tennis shoes, and that some sections of lava are unstable and may simply be thin crusts covering sinkholes.  Less common park dangers include rattlesnakes, scorpions and spiders, which can be easily avoided by being cautious in rocky areas; these creatures crawl under rocks to avoid the sun, so be cautious when reaching into crevices or overturning rocks.  In addition, the area around McCartys crater was once used as a military bombing range, and while unlikely, it is possible that unexploded ordinances may be encountered if traveling in this remote location.  It goes without saying that any munitions that are encountered should not be handled and should be reported to rangers.</field>

		<field name="content">Like many post-industrial cities, South Bend has some trouble spots.  To be safe, lock your vehicle when you plan to leave it unattended anywhere downtown, but especially in a parking garage or low lit area after dark.  Places to be careful during the day and not walk through after dark include areas on and around Lincoln Way West between William St. and the airport, SR 23 and Madison St. on the East Side of downtown and the river, Western Avenue between William St. and Mayflower, and US 31 between Monroe and Donmoyer Ave. to the north and south and Miami St. and Olive/Locust Rd. to the east and west.  Essentially, the south and west sides of downtown and a small portion of the east side can be dangerous, but the majority of neighborhoods are safe. Portage Road and going north towards Cleveland is also known for crime. Take care as you would in any major city after dark.  One natural threat to be aware of are tornadoes: if you hear a siren or there is a tornado warning issued, take it seriously.  Because South Bend/Michiana is so far North of the tornado belt, there are very few twisters in the area, even during tornado season.  However, the tornadoes that do occur are usually F0s which, though comparatively weak, are often low to the ground and very difficult to spot with doppler radar, making advanced warning more difficult.  Though much smaller events, their winds speeds can reach as high as 90 miles per hour and they can cause very localized damage in a short period.</field>

		<field name="content">fresh wolf tracks on the Greenstone Ridge trail   The Brothers Grimm gave wolves a very unfair portrayal; unless you are a young or feeble moose, youre in no danger from them.  Although theyve gotten a little less furtive lately as they look harder for moose (whose numbers have gone down substantially), theyre still very good at avoiding humans, and even mere sightings are still infrequent.  On the other hand, moose can be very dangerous if provoked (theres a reason wolves only go after the weak ones, and do so in packs), especially if you get between a mother and her calf, or if you confront a bull during mating season.  But otherwise theyre nothing to be afraid of, and will probably regard you the same way.  The greatest danger is your own foolishness: pushing yourself too hard, or ignoring basic principles of wilderness health and safety (e.g. keeping dry, water sanitation, floatation devices on the water).  Canoeing, kayaking, or swimming in Lake Superior can be particularly hazardous due to the potential roughness of the water (its more like a freshwater sea than a mere lake) and the hypothermia-inducing temperature just below the surface year-round.    The water from Lake Superior is safe enough when filtered, but some streams and inland lake sources are not as wholesome.  Good filtration (not iodine tablets) is a must and some water from marshlands may need to be pre-filtered to prevent clogging.  The taller ridges can reach 80+ degrees on a warm summers day, and there are no water sources up there.  Plan ahead and bring plenty of water, as the ridge trails are a strenuous hike.  Nothing is worse than being exhausted and out of water 1000 feet above Lake Superior!    If youre injured, theres limited medical assistance available on the island, and its going to have a difficult time getting to you in the backcountry.  There are ranger stations at Snug Harbor, Windigo, Malone Bay (on the south shore), and Amygdaloid Island (off the northeast shore), and a ranger resident at Daisy Farm, any of which can radio for help and arrange for helicopter transport to the mainland (at your expense) for professional medical care.   a semi-tame fox skulking about Snug Harbor   Surprisingly, there is a theft problem at Isle Royale campgrounds, and the culprits inevitably escape prosecution on the grounds that they are not human.  Foxes are the worst culprits, potentially stealing anything left unattended, including boots, socks, and even cameras.  Squirrels ndash; especially those whove had a previous taste of the exotic foods humans eat ndash; will brazenly steal food from your hand when your head is turned (not much caring if they bite you in the process), or chew through your backpack if they catch a whiff of such ambrosia inside.  Double-plastic-bagging and vigilance are advised.  This is important both for your own well-being and that of the animals; camp foxes quickly become dependent on human food and stop hunting, which is both nutritionally bad for them and leaves them to starve when the humans all go away for the long winter.</field>

		<field name="name">stay safe</field>
		<field name="content">Despite the fact that Buffalos crime rate has fallen steadily since the 1990s, it is still higher than the national average for cities its size. By Buffalo standards, Allentown has a moderate-to-high crime rate. The general rule for Allentown is that the closer you are to Delaware or Elmwood Avenues, the safer you are. Despite (or perhaps because of) the rapid gentrification that is taking place there, a particularly troubled area is the blocks west of Wadsworth Street, straddling Allentown and the Lower West Side. Reports of assaults and robberies in Days Park occur with some frequency. That being the case, visitors should by no means allow these occasional incidents to put them off from experiencing this part of Allentown—the lush greenery of the park and the splendid Victorian cottages surrounding it are simply magnificent, police patrols have increased sharply, and perhaps more than any other area of Buffalo, residents of the Days Park area are working diligently to "take back their streets". Those who exercise common sense—locking car doors, keeping valuables out of sight—will be fine. The Main Street corridor is another problem area.  The Delaware District boasts an extremely low crime rate. Visitors should not experience problems of any kind there.  Many longtime fans of the Allentown bar scene lament the fact that, over the past few years, the bars have begun to attract a rowdier crowd, perhaps influenced by the burgeoning Chippewa Street entertainment district a short distance from here. That being said, the Allentown scene is still far more laid-back than Chippewa—and the Buffalo Police are ubiquitous on the Allen Street strip on weekend nights to make sure of that. Visitors to Allentown bars are far more likely to be annoyed by cooler-than-thou hipsters than by belligerent drunks.  Though it is not nearly as much of a problem there as it is downtown and in the Elmwood Village, panhandlers are present in Allentown. The homeless tend to congregate around "The Bend"—that is, the west end of Allen Street where it veers right and becomes Wadsworth Street—near which there is a soup kitchen. As elsewhere in Buffalo, aggressive panhandling in Allentown is unheard of; a firm "no" will usually do the trick. Panhandlers are almost completely absent from the Delaware District.</field>
